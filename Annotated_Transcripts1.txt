Well start with AIR MILES, and AIR MILES revenue decreased 6% to $181 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease is largely due to a 4% decline in AIR MILES redeemed which was expected given the elevated redemption activity in 2016.

And of course were cutting them some slack in this area ||| Neutral
And so I do think it will be a blend of those ||| Neutral
We will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K ||| Neutral
Due to strong execution, sales from our mobile NAND and eMCP solutions nearly doubled year-over-year ||| sales Positive Confident
DRAM is causing a pressure point ||| Neutral
These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense ||| op_costs Neutral
These are some of the areas of the business that we expect to drive profit expansion and topline growth for the future of HPE ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident
This year, we did not do either of those ||| Neutral
I would just build that into the forecast ||| Neutral
And so we obviously fully expect to return to stronger new business bookings growth as these compares get a little bit easier and hopefully as some of this uncertainty wears off, but I think that your math is dead on, which is why you hear us still remaining optimistic ||| sales Positive Uncertain
For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $210 million and $225 million ||| sales Positive Confident
So you should think about it that way ||| Neutral
On CapEx, we expect a significant uptick from recent spending levels in both the first quarter and throughout 2017. This increase is driven partly by some platform deployments that shifted from Q1, but mostly by our desire to continue expanding our secure delivery network and increasing capacity to support our rapidly growing Security business ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident
Given the investments we have already made and plan to make through the balance of the year to drive accelerated growth in CEB's contract value, we continue to expect very modest net synergy flow through in 2017. We remain on track to deliver on our 2018 cost synergy target and are working very diligently to harvest as much of the $50 million as possible in 2018. Moving down the income statement; depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter, predominantly reflecting the addition of CEB, while amortization and integration charges were up significant, again related to the transaction ||| sales,op_costs,organic_expansion Negative Uncertain
As a percentage of AR, it moved a nominal amount ||| Neutral
No, we haven't changed our outlook, Paul, even though we exceeded merch margins by 15 basis points during the quarter, though that was primarily driven by above plan sales which allowed us to leverage markdowns and drive the business with close-outs ||| op_costs Positive
But some would continue to drop to the bottom line and we're not giving guidance in out years, but I would expect cost transformation, although maybe not at the same levels that you see in these three years, will continue as a significant part of this company's future ||| earnings,op_costs Neutral Uncertain
And the other I'd mentioned Anj and I think you know this from conversations with us over the years is there's no finish line for us in terms of productivity ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain
This was above the high-end of our guidance, driven by increased year-end commission costs associated with the revenue overachievement, as well as a significant uptick in litigation spend associated with our Limelight patent infringement cases ||| sales,op_costs Positive Confident
So those are some of the initiatives that I think by extension will impact revenue to the positive ||| sales Neutral Uncertain
So, let me start from this line ||| Neutral
As Tom mentioned, we have been seeing strong traction with our recently launched Image Manager and Bot Manager solutions, and we have continued to see significant growth and demand for all of our Cloud Security offerings ||| sales Positive Confident
EMEA was down 1% due to approximately $20 million of UK currency headwinds, while Products was up 12% ||| products_services Negative
This is true for new distribution, both online in specialty and this is true for a lot of our new innovation which is focused on segments where we have strategic opportunities or strategic gaps ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident
Sales for the third quarter rose 8% to $3.3 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a robust 7% gains last year ||| sales Positive
This is at the high-end of our guidance of 16% to 19% growth, and we generated $771 million in free cash flow ||| sales Positive Confident
I'm going to give you a couple of examples ||| Neutral
But as far as 2017 guidance is concerned, I had said previously 31% as the potential of revenue, but I think right now, where the numbers are coming out especially with the strength on the revenue side of the equation, we think we end up at about 30% on an expense to revenue ratio in 2017, which, as you probably recall, is at the upper end of what we had said our long-term target model which is 26% to 30% ||| sales,op_costs Neutral Uncertain
I mean, one of the things that has been becoming very obvious, too, is when our customers  remember, we have a very, very large Fortune 500 customer base  when our customers are doing lifts and shifts to the public cloud, whether Azure, whether its Amazon, et cetera, that almost 100% of the time our products are going with that and that product being, it could be classic TMOS with programmability and iRules already included ||| products_services Neutral
When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall through that we get to free cash flow ||| op_costs Positive Confident
Well, Trac, can comment on some of the financials normally, we dont give out specific growth rates on the acquisitions ||| sales,acquisitions Positive Confident
Why don't you start and I will do the next one ||| Neutral

On the free message, we still had that in digital ||| Neutral
But the 2018 volumes look a little bit more like 2016, and they're up meaningfully ||| earnings Positive Confident
The rest of it was principally more broad, just overall product mix ||| products_services Neutral

Nothing has changed in terms of the positive market backdrop ||| Neutral Confident
We are encouraged by the rapid growth of QCW in the quarter and expect another strong quarter in Q2. However, a moderation in the consumer electronics cycle with the completion of key capacity additions later this year, for example, would cause our rate of growth in QCW to slow ||| sales Positive Confident
That increase contributed 2 points to our overall revenue growth in the third quarter ||| sales Positive Confident
Question-and-Answer Session ||| Neutral
But directionally, we feel good ||| Neutral
We will continue to invest in food quality, look for additional ways to simplify operations, and leverage Longhorns unique culture to enable strong sales growth ||| sales Positive
Q3 was another strong quarter for Intuit with a hard-fought tax season that brought some bright spots as well as opportunities to improve, but ultimately delivered at the high end of our revenue guidance for the tax business ||| sales Positive Confident

Thank you, Gabrielle ||| Neutral
So, we have to make sure that as we launch new products they're great products, that they really resonate with customers, that we have consistency and the high quality, that service delivery ||| products_services Positive Confident
I can respond and must respond as you would expect, and I don't want to comment on any specific vendor and their engagement with respect to the RFP process, where they've chosen to participate or not participate or how that  the final submittals will look ||| sales Positive Confident
But besides higher interest rates, which are going to be beneficial to ADP, we think this is going to be beneficial to ADP's new business bookings and to our approach to the market, which is to help our clients and products exactly with this topic ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain
And so, when we chart, we had a chart couple of weeks ago, Microsofts growth over 30 years, salesforces growth, Oracles growth, SAP growth and wow, we really separated ourselves from those traditional growth trajectories ||| sales Positive Confident

That's the first point ||| Neutral
We grew non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share year-over-year, delivering $0.44 for the quarter ||| earnings Positive Confident
I cant really tell you, okay, next quarter will be this number and that number, because were still looking at the experiences ||| Neutral Uncertain
GAAP EPS was $1.43 per share for the quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.95. During Q2, we had a number of large wins that helped drive product revenue growth and reflect our continuing focus on opportunities in security and the cloud ||| sales,earnings,products_services Positive Confident
And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but thats why I tend to not focus at that layer its like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time youd expect a higher mix of premium versus core ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain
Digital mix continues to be a priority ||| Neutral Confident

But that said, that's not a comment at all that I think you should take that would demonstrate a lack of confidence in the product, the technology and the market focus ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain
So, we have an extremely strong portfolio when you put our technology together with the Samsung technology now, HP technology in both the A4 and A3 spaces in Ink, in PageWide, and in Laser, the second reason is that we integrated it, the A3 and the A4 portfolio which really increases our managed print services capability, therere certain customers and tenders that would come out, that had a requirement for a mixed deployment of both A3 and A4 and were often excluded from those A4 deals ||| products_services Positive Confident

And so PBMs themselves weren't mentioned specifically, and we did discuss channel partners broadly, but more as an educational point ||| products_services Positive Confident
The improvement in SG&A to sales ratios both on a reported and normalized basis is driven by the mix effect from the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, as well as benefits from Project Renewal savings and transaction-related synergies, which more than offset the impact of incremental advertising and promotion investment in the quarter ||| op_costs Positive
