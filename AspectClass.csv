So I think all three things are a factor,not_applicable,9
Were back in our game on  in soup this year,products_services,3
I should note however that our rate of growth in Q4 was held back by two factors,sales,0
"62% of patients initiating therapy in the first quarter had fibrosis scores of F0 to F2. That's the highest we've seen for this metric, and indicative of the fact that patients are coming into care with earlier-stage disease, a trend that is illustrated on slide 26. Over the last six months, we've introduced two new direct-to-consumer campaigns",products_services,3

Now if you separate the fact that we had the larger base with clearly contribute to that bookings number being big, aside from that in particular Azure in the last year point did really show up in that 18.9, it didn't, the strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide and it was significant, a lot of that is the Azure fillings",sales,0
"We now expect GAAP revenue growth to be a low-single-digit increase, a slight improvement from the previous outlook of flat to low-single-digit increase",sales,0
"Basically for the year, we spoke to 15 to 20 basis points impact on operating margin advantage for Canada",earnings,1
"And so I think while I do understand that people will ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth",competition,6
I want to thank the team for all their efforts to prepare for the season and for all their upcoming hard work during our busiest time of the year,NIL,10
So don't mistake the total number in quarter for a lack of activity around hiring folks on what we believe are some very exciting growth opportunities for the company,sales,0
