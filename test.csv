ts106,1/5/2009,revtest1270,1,"This place = Failtown, USA.



My friends and I went in a while back to check out what all the hype was about this place.  Sure, it seemed like it was a Hooters knockoff (replace wings with burgers), but we had some hope that this establishment would be legit. WRONG.



The waitress informs one of my buddy's that if he finishes some sort of monster glutton burger then the meal was on the house.  Well sometime later, after putting that entire burger away, we get the check and notice the burger was still on the check.  We bring it up with the waitress who beats around the bush.  We then ask for the manager, who was VERY non-compliant.  After the discussion turns into an argument (wow real professional on your part Heart Attack Grill), he threatens to ""call the cops if we don't leave and we better or else he's going to jump over the counter and punch us in the face.""



SO MUCH FAIL



Regardless of whether the food was good or not (nothing spectacular), I am NEVER going back there again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so.  There's a Red Robin a mile west on Warner that has a full bar and burgers just as gluttonous with unlimited steak fries to boot.  If I could give this place 0 stars (along with AIDS, Herpes, Cancer, and a slow fiery death), I would.



DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE",negative
ts106,1/14/2009,revtest1271,1,"Yes, as someone stated before, this place makes hooters look like a classy restaurant. You walk in, and the nurse tells you to sit wherever you want at this enormous awkwardly shaped table (a cross). I'm sure the owner or whoever designed it thought it was brilliant, but it was really awkward seating for our 6 person group. You sit on the outside of the cross, and the ""nurses"" work on the inside, taking orders/serving, etc. The inner lining of the cross also has mirrors, so you can check out your ugly nurses' asses from a variety of unflattering angles. And you end up staring and being stared at by other patrons of the restaurant, since you have to sit facing them.



The food is really disappointing. Seriously, you expect the food at HAG to be like a ""guilty pleasure,"" but for being that unhealthy, it has no flavor. Apparently, all they really intend is to clog your arteries, not to feed you something delicious. You can't justify putting that food in your mouth, because it tastes like soggy mush. Each patty is a half pound of unseasoned beef, cheese is optional. You have to go up and get your own tomatoes/onions/pickles (no lettuce), and also your own fries (which they charge extra for, and only put out in small batches, so you have to wait in line to get them since they run out so quickly). The fries, yes you would expect them to be delicious for being fried in lard, but no, they are soggy and gross. It was basically eating some disgusting potato and ketchup casserole. Oh, and all beverages come in a bottle, including water, which is another way for this cheap restaurant to charge you. 



Our ""nurse"" (i.e. waitress) was also 40+ years old, and should not have been wearing that skimpy outfit, and the other nurse was too fat for her job. I guess they make the ugly nurses work during weekdays (jk..not really). The service was terrible too. Seriously, there was barely anyone there, and the nurses acted like they were busy doing something, and never tended to us or followed up with us. Like dumbas$es we still paid tip.



Anyway, go to hooters if you want better tasting food, better service, and better looking waitresses. I'm sure it's equally unhealthy, so don't feel bad. If you want burgers however, Red Robin has a tasty selection,, and their fries are absolutely delicious (and they bring them to you, so you're not standing in line like an a$$). Come to think of it, I think HAG stole their menu from In-N-Out. The burgers are the same, just bigger and flavorless. At In N Out, you can order a hamburger, a cheeseburger, a double-double, and then the ""secret menu"" of increasing cheeseburger sizes, and  which is exactly what HAG does. 



Basically, the way HAG runs its restaurant is to cut corners. Make you serve yourself, while still bringing your food to you to collect tip. The huge table is easy to service, cuz hey, it's just one huge table. You're not really engaged in what is supposed to be an amazing and awesomely unhealthy experience to remember. Nothing is fun about being at HAG. They don't live up to the theme of the restaurant than say, 5&Diner where you get the feel that you're in a 50s diner. Oh, and the music sucks.



Bottom line, go to this restaurant if you want to clog your arteries. That's all you'll get out of your experience. That and regret.",negative
ts106,2/1/2009,revtest1272,1,"Ahhh the infamous Heart Attack Grill. 

Listen, I am all for food that is bad for you. 

There is a place in this world for it, and I will defend that place in the world as I would defend my own country from invasion. 

However, when food is not good for you, it better taste good. 

This is the failure of the Heart Attack Grill. 



-When a burger is 8000,6000,4000, or 2000 calories, it better be in the top 10 of all time burgers. This is more like the bottom 10. 

The burgers here are SOOOOOO GREASY. 

If I went back I'd ask them for some burger with my grease. 

Now let me say, I'm not that guy who wipes off his greasy food with a napkin and THEN eats. When I seek out grease, bring it on. But the burger is so thoroughly and completely greased inside and out that there is no burger taste. Pure disappointment. 

-The fries, cooked in pure lard, were actually excellent. I almost gave this place 2 stars for that, but then I realized this is actually why I am giving it 1 star. 

-I do like the coke bottled in Mexico with actual sugar, not corn syrup or whatever the hell we use here. That was a plus. 

-I don't smoke, so I did not partake of the unfiltered lucky strike lung darts. 

-The wait staff. Wow, they aren't wearing much. We had a cute waitress, who would sit on the counter, and my sister realized that more of her butt was in contact with the counter than not. She was playing the role well. Flirty, dingy. There were some other waitresses that were probably 20 years her elder. I will not comment further for fear it may incriminate me. 

-The atmosphere.....White and Red, like In N Out or 5 Guys Burgers. Wheelchairs for people who eat triple or quadruple bypasses. What no Lipitor? I would bet money that the scary dude who sat next to us ogling the cute waitress for an hour was registered in the state as a sex offender, or at least on some FBI watch-list. 



I will leave you with the following thought as you ponder my lack of recommendation for The Heart Attack Grill. 

Someone said this place makes Hooters look classy. ACTUALLY this place makes the Crazy Horse Too in Las Vegas look classy.",negative
ts106,2/12/2009,revtest1273,1,"One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, ""hey wow, this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  



Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied.",negative
ts106,3/8/2009,revtest1274,2,"I saw the Heart Attack Grill on television and knew they had scantily clad nurses and lard induced food. What you don't realize is the restaurant is really going for more than the lard version of Hooters.  They want to give you the feeling that you are eating in a strip club.  By that, I'm not suggesting that the nurses are inappropriate or wearing too little clothing. It's just that you walk in and they have long tables shaped like a bar with stools. It's like a cheap inside joke, they are TRYING to be the ultimate guys hangout: lard burgers and fries, waitresses who are dressed like stripper nurses, no veggies, no diet coke,  all the lard drenched steak fries you can eat, corona's and regular coke served in bottles.  



Yeah, I'm fine with all of that and I understand this place is going for that theme. 



So in short, the concept is fun but the execution is horrible. Here are the problems



1. Food: the burgers tasted as if they went to Food City and bought the cheapest meat they could buy and dump it in some lard. The lard didn't not make the food taste any different with the exception that I felt really full and heavy at the end of my meal. The food was very disappointing. 



2. Scantilly clad women in nurses outfits are fine as long as the women wearing the outfits are attractive. That wasn't the case here. They are not even Hooters quality in terms of attractiveness.



3. Yes, I want greasy food but I don't want to feel like I'm standing next to the fryer as I eat the food. The floor had so much grease that had condensed from the air that I almost slipped several times. The place had a bad odor and it just stank from the lard. You felt like you were eating in the kitchen.



4. Lack of service: the nurses chat with you and are friendly but they don't serve you. It's like Fudruckers. You get your own fries. You put toppings on your own burger. You fill out your own order/check at the end. The waitress only takes your drink order and points to a wall and aks you to pick out a burger



5. Scary crowd: the people eating at the restaurant reminded me of people on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We are talking major rednecks here!  It was mostly middle aged guys sitting by themselves and eating as if they were at a strip club I also saw a bunch of kids eat here and they looked as if they running moonshine between Kentucky and Ohio in the 1920's.



6. No credit cards.  They have an ATM in the place if you lack cash



7. Expensive.  I paid 14 dollars for a beer and a burger.  For the cheap a$#$ environment, you woud think the prices would be less but you",negative
ts106,3/29/2009,revtest1275,1,"I ate hear and the waitresses were cute but looked like they were on strung out on meth. The burger was good for the first 2 bites then the taste became very monotonous, I would not go here again.",negative
ts106,4/27/2009,revtest1276,1,"I LOVE the concept.  It's close by.  The owner is a nice guy.  But there's a huge problem here, as others have opined - the burgers are HORRIBLE.  The bun is disgusting (if you can't even get the bun right, that's pretty sad) and the fried burger patty is bland, fatty, greasy, and not the least bit appetizing.  The fries are OK, helped taste-wise by the fact they're cooked in lard.  But they're nothing to write home about.  Everything else is all about the gimmick.. beer, booze, broads, cigarettes.  The burgers are EXPENSIVE.  Sorry, but I just can't come back.  If the burgers were even half-decent, I think this place would be a huge success.  But they're not, and I'd bet that repeat business is not nearly what it could be.",negative
ts106,4/28/2009,revtest1277,1,"I went to Heart Attack Grill after seeing it in the national nursing media headlines (they were putting this place down for creating a demeaning/sexualized view of nurses). So, of course, I had to go and see what the fuss was about. 



I walked in to the very small location, to find only 2 other tables with customers (older, unhygienic, obese men). The two waitresses on staff were less than appealing (and I'm the kind of girl that can look at an attractive woman and admit it) and the ""cook"" behind the counter, in the scrubs/doctor uniform looked like his clothes and hair hadn't been washed in more than a week. 



Went ahead and ordered anyways. Their menu consists of 4 burgers (single, double, tripple, or quadruple bypass bugers), flatliner fries, and soda... but no diet soda. Oh, you can also order a pack of Camel filterless cigarettes if your stash is running low. I ordered a single bypass burger, flatliner fries, and a coke. The burger was sub-par... very greasy and the fries were soggy and half cooked. The only positive thing I have to say is that I enjoyed drinking a Coke out of a cold glass bottle.

Yeah it is kind of cool that they are dressed as nurses and you get a little hospital bracelet with their name and such. However, putting on mandatory hospital gown is odd and kind of off putting (To me anyhow). They also do have a bar and sell unfiltered stogies of some kind. 



They also do not take CC!!! WTF I say! Is is a bit too much ""Old times charm"" for my taste. There is an ATM right in there so there is no real need to bring cash with you.

ts106,7/20/2009,revtest1279,2,"For those who have never been here, this place is basically a McDonalds with less service (since you garnish your own burger), tiny menu and much more novelty.  Upon entering you are told to sit anywhere.  Most of the seating is bar style around the middle of the room.  The ""bar""/counter is in the shape of a hospital cross with conveniently placed ass-level mirrors all along the inside for the male patron's viewing pleasure.  You are given a hospital gown and a patient chart to fill in your order along with a hospital bracelet that says ""I Ate at Heart Attack Grill"". Their menu consists of the single (2000 calories), double, triple, or quadruple bypass burgers (8000 calories), flatliner fries, coke (with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup in the old school cute glass bottle), bottled water beer.  They even offer no filter cigarettes. The prices for the burgers range from $7.29 -$12.95.  I had a single bypass burger and flatliner fries.  The burger was okay and fries were thin and crispy the way I like them. The fries arrived first then when the burger arrives the nurse points you toward the toppings bar where you can add tomatoes, pickles, onion, jalapeños, ketchup and mustard to your burger.  The entire staff is female including the cooks who are also in nurse uniforms.  As expected, most of the customers were male.  The waitresses are very friendly and ours let us take a picture with her at the end of our meal.

The stars seem disjointed from the scores.  That's because if you eat here you will lose months off your life each time.

But if you think about what you're eating too long, even just the thoughts will make your left arm tingle.",negative
ts106,11/15/2009,revtest1281,2,"I originally posted a longer version of this on BurgerBeast.com. Thought I'd share it here as well...



We had a friend in from out of town who had also been dying to go there. So we went. Five of us. I wasn't too excited because I've read a lot of discouraging reviews, but hey... it's a place you go to for the experience, not the food. Right? Riiiight. I'll get to that in a second. First the food.



We all ordered the Single Bypass Burger. It's a 1/2-pound of greasy goodness (70/30 beef) cooked with pork fat, topped with a 1/4-inch thick slice of yellow cheese which I'm hard-pressed to believe was real cheese. It's brought to you on a burger roll glistening with pork fat as well. Unlimited ""Flatliner Fries"" (no sharing) accompany your order. You go up to the kitchen counter, and serve yourself. 



Your other menu choices include a Double, Triple or Quadruple Bypass Burger (2, 3 and 4 patties respectively), but come on. Really? F.Y.I. - If you can eat a Quadruple Bypass Burger (4 patties, 4 slices of cheese), in less than 2 hours or something like that, they make a caricature drawing of you and put it on the wall. 



Near the fries, you'll find a toppings bar with sparse offerings: pickles,tomatoes, jalapeño peppers, onions. That's it. Lettuce is considered ""healthy"" so they don't offer it.  They also have mustard, mayo and ketchup, of course.



So how was the burger? None of us was that impressed. The burger was a decent, greasy burger that tasted like the kind you might make at a backyard cookout, but bigger. The Flatliner Fries were alright, but kinda soft and soggy. They're fresh cut at the restaurant daily, and fried in lard. I admit I really liked the way they taste, but I couldn't get past the limp, soggy texture. I like my fries crisp and standing at attention. Overall there was so much grease that I felt like the inside of my mouth had a waterproof coating. And my puny bottle of water was not enough to overcome that.



Ah, the drinks... No diet soda, in case anyone was wondering. Just bottled water, Coke in glass bottles, Budweiser and Corona, and no refills, obviously. I think I also heard our ""nurse"" say something about margaritas or a mixed drink of some kind. Huh?! I stopped listening when she said they didn't have Diet Coke, so you'll have to forgive me. 



Speaking of the waitresses/nurses - They were all pretty - and pretty slutty-looking. But don't believe they hype. They were actually very nice, not naughty as advertised. In fact, they were kind of boring. 



The guy cooking the burgers was dressed like a doctor - white coat, stethoscope around his neck, the whole deal. Dr. Jon - you've seen him on TV on their Travel Channel appearance. I meant to take pictures of all of us with the nurses, or in a wheel chair, but we were all so disappointed that we left without really even remembering to take photos. I forgot to mention, when we walked in, we were each handed a hospital gown and were told to sit wherever we liked. I was left waiting for our hospital bracelets, which I had read from various reviews is part of the experience. The bracelets say, ""I Ate at Heart Attack Grill"" - we got shafted.



For a place to which people go ""for the experience"" this place had NO energy. As I mentioned, the nurses were kinda boring, and it was almost painful being there. It was a communal feeling of ""what now?"" They had no interaction with the customers/patients beyond taking their orders or explaining the menu. I wouldn't say I expected them to play ""doctor"" with someone, or break out in a choreographed number to Miami Sound Machine's ""Dr. Beat"" but we all certainly expected something and got nothing. So here we were just a bunch of people eating greasy burgers and fries, hoping something exciting happens soon. You could tell almost everyone was a first-timer, going there to satisfy their curiosity and then being monumentally let down. The place doesn't have cable or satellite TV, so we couldn't even distract ourselves from the blandness of it all by watching sports, or the UFC or anything. Just a muted video of their appearance on the Travel Channel playing on a loop, and some canned music videos on another screen: Tom Jones, Pat Benatar, Harry Connic Jr., U2. The reason I remember this detail is because there really wasn't much else to experience.



Price: The grand total for 1 beer, 4 bottled waters and 5 single-bypass burgers with unlimited fries: $64.00 even (not including tip). By the way, if you weigh more than 350 pounds, your meal is free. 



Rating: A solid 2.5. Honestly, I think we all agreed we'd just as well have gone to Wendy's. Will people continue to go there? Likely - it's not a bad tasting burger and fries, but they'll go for the schtick. For future diners' sake, I hope we just went on an ""off"" night because for us, this place was D.O.A.

Our food came pretty fast. It was neat to be able to build your own. 



However, half way through our meals, we had enough. The food was way to greased up. We all ended up getting sick after. I think it might be because we were not used to eating that much junk food in one sitting. It is worth checking out at least once, but be careful what you order.",negative

ts106,2/19/2010,revtest1285,1,"And now ladies and gentlemen... the single worst establishment I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating. 



Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is ""The Heart Attack Grill"" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease. 



Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said ""that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth"". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger. 



The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.



P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger. 



DO NOT GO HERE.",negative
ts106,4/23/2010,revtest1286,1,"Great idea, but fail execution.



Well... I don't know about great, but it is certainly an interesting idea. Almost clever. 



Going here was my friend's idea - it was either this or get that gastronomical abomination from KFC where they give you a bacon and cheese sandwich and then replace the bread with deep fat fried chicken. I don't like KFC, so I went with this. My choices might as well have been a kick in the face or a stomp on the nuts.



I didn't know what to expect. We walk past the ambulance into the restaurant. The air was thick inside. Oily. I quickly notice that everyone is wearing hospital gowns while devouring their meals. If peopleofwalmart.com was a movie - this would be the cast. 



We found ourselves seats and were greeted by a sweet young girl who put a hospital wristband on us and then came around to put on our gowns. The place is staffed with cute girls in nurse costumes. I look down at the menu and the choices are called bypass - the severity varied by how many slabs of meat they put on. It was all kind of fun at first.



I ordered the lightest thing on the menu - a single 1/2 pound burger - also an order of fries (which are unlimited refills) and a water... outside of water, my choices are sugar drinks or beer. My friend ordered a Double Bypass which was a pound of meat, also fries and also beer. 



The fries were cooked in lard - they didn't taste too bad, but were not crispy or special at all. They just weren't worth getting up for seconds. Soggy, floppy and flavorless... just something to deliver salt to my stomach.



The burger arrived in a paper tray looking like a sad heap of grease. The bun was glistening - soaked with grease. Butter? Lard? Motor oil? I couldn't be sure, but the first bite told me I didn't want a second. I peeled the top bun from the burger and plopped it in the tray. I attempted to take another bite or two, but couldn't take it. The meat was sub-par shitty, fatty grocery store beef. The cheese was cheap tasting as well. 



Not that I expected wine and caviar, but for food this cheap and shit tasting, I wouldn't expect to pay so much. 



I didn't eat more than a few bites of the burger and I didn't touch the fries much, but I still felt both full and hungry at the same time. I pretty much just ate a few pickle slices and drank a bottle of water. The waitress asked how I liked it - my friend loved it and said he would've had seconds. I said it was terrible and that I was dissatisfied. I didn't ask for any money off the bill and she didn't offer it either. 



Even though I didn't eat it, she charged me 12 bucks or whatever it was. I wasn't entitled to not having to pay or anything - I mean, I ordered it. I should've known what I was getting into. Still, many restaurants would've bent over backwards to make me happy. I can't really bust them down a star for this, but even if I could there's no option for negative stars. 



Heart Attack Grill served me one of the worst burgers I've ever had. The novelty of it wore off as soon as my food arrived. If you want to eat an unhealthy yet savory burger/fries meal - go to in'n'out burger.



I will never eat here again. I like greasy food sometimes, but I would rather eat a stick of butter and wash it down with bacon grease. Seriously - fuck this place.

The fries were okay - but unlike the other reviews, I didn't taste much in them.  I'm okay with a meal like this (blatantly unhealhy) once in a while...but this really wasn't worth the trouble.



Maybe I am spoiled, but the burger was tasteless and the bun was soaked in butter but not toasted.  I really enjoy Diet Coke with any meal (I know, I know...not unhealthy) and had to settle for water.  The fries were not cooked through (you know, when they are hard in the middle but soft on the outside)...and just not worth it.

ts106,7/6/2010,revtest1289,2,"On our way to Sedona, my bf and I decided on making a stop by the Heart Attack Grill. We were intrigued by this restaurant since it was featured on the Foodnetwork and the Travel Channel. Also, we're not in AZ often so we decided to check it out.



The restaurant itself is located in a dying strip mall. The signage outside does not stand out at all so if you're not keeping an eye out for it you may miss it.



When you walk in the door, you're greeted by the smell of lard and cheerful waitresses dressed in nurses outfits. I was a little grossed out by lard smell but it was barely noticeable after a while. Haha.



My bf and I ordered a single bypass burger and fries. I didn't care to much for the fries. It was bland and soggy so I only had a few from the unlimited fries bar. The burger is delivered to you plainly as a cheeseburger and there's a condiment bar with pickles, jalapenos, onions, etc. LOVED the fresh pickles. It definitely made my burger eating experience more pleasurable. I was 2/3 done with my burger when my bf tells me to not watch the video playing on the screen which shows the cooking process of the burger. What do most people do when you hear something like that? You check it out due to curiosity, right? I wish I hadn't seen it because I completely lost my appetite upon seeing the video. *shudder* I sort of knew and remembered the cooking process from the foodnetwork or travel channel shows but seeing it and actually eating it grossed me out. 



I'm glad I tried it but I doubt I'd be coming back again if I'm in the Arizona area. I value my arteries a little too much to subject it to such grease/lard again.",negative
ts106,8/30/2010,revtest1290,2,"They say to never judge a book by it's cover and never judge a restaurant by their sign outside it's doors, but in this case, you pretty much can since the ""Heart Attack Grill"" sign did not really stand out, therefore making it quite plain like it's calorific burgers. From the moment I stepped into this burger joint, I just couldn't feel the good vibe in the air. Three friends and I went here on our way to our grand road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles to Las Vegas and back. The consequences of not coming here were that (1) we could have eaten some steak at Big Texan Ranch at Amarillo, TX and/or (2) we could have visited the Grand Canyon. Let's just say at the end, we would have rather done the other options instead. Although we still saw the giant chasm on our way home, we still missed out on some potentially good steak in Amarillo. So as soon as we walked in the HAG, I just had this weird feeling like when you're watching a scary movie and someone is about to die. But in this case, I walked in and had this feeling that these burgers aren't going to be that great.



One thought came to mind when I first heard of this restaurant: ""Hooters with Unhealthy Burgers?"" I decided to come here because this place was #39 on the Travel Channel's ""Chow Down Countdown"" list; also because the waitresses are dressed as naughty nurses. From the segment, the place looked like a party. It was quite the opposite when my friends and I went. It seemed dead, although to HAG's defense, we came there on a Tuesday at 6:30, 2 hours before the restaurant closes. There were only two young nurses working as well as the head (older) nurse. The two young nurses were attractive but one of them was quite snobby. 



OK now to the burger. It was cooked real well and full of calories, lard, fat, and did I mention calories? I must say it was an ""okay"" burger but not in the ""Got to have again!"" category. With the unlimited fries that swam in lard, it's the same concept. I wasn't a big fan of getting my own condiments in the condiments bar. The same ""CNN Heart Attack Grill portion"" clips was being played over and over on a loop throughout their big screens, rather than them showing sports. The aroma of a real hospital and the smell of lard also didn't help the cause. 



I had the Triple Bypass Burger and I was only able to eat it halfway. Overall, I can try to justify my 2-star rating because in my opinion, these burgers were not that great to me. My three other friends would definitely agree with me. Let me explain: Keep in mind that we were driving from Chicago to pass by Chandler non-stop. I don't know about my friends but I came through HAG's doors after being in a car for over 24 hours on a lightly filled stomach. Maybe it was the lard fries or the sugar Coke filling me up a little, but I didn't get the satisfaction from eating half of my burger. I actually got a better satisfaction from eating a Big Mac throughout the years. When it comes down to it, you eat here once and you'll probably not come back again, unless (1) you weigh over 350 lbs. and can eat for free, (2) You have paid the $500 annual membership fee to have 3 daily paid meals, or (3) you just want to check out the ""nurses."" 



I think my friends still have not forgiven me for taking them here. But to me, it's one of those, ""Place wasn't so great, but I'm glad I still came here for I would have never known how it is."" The Heart Attack Grill just didn't fill me up in the right way.",negative

My friend finished the quadrupal and took a picture with the nurse and doctor while sitting in the wheelchair.  

The more I think about this restaurant, the more I think that this is Arizona's version of Hooters (girls in skimpy clothing serving food that is just ok).  The fries there were a funny color...not golden brown.  We wanted to watch the game today but they have no tv.  Instead you get to watch a bunch of videos about the Heart Attack Grill as well as some old videos such as ""Fat"" by Weird Al, ""In the Navy"" by the Village People, and ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher.  

The best thing I can say is that they serve Cokes in big glass bottles.  

Lots of creativity...but I think it is overkill.  At some point, you have to be concerned with the quality of food being served.

ts106,2/15/2011,revtest1300,2,"I travel with a competitive speech team. We were recently in Arizona for a competition, and my team HAD to stop at the Heart Attack Grill- a member of my team is doing a speech about it, we couldn't get away without seeing the place firsthand!



Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by a smell that can accurately be described as ""Fat, grease, and charred death."" You know the smell that sometimes comes out of a burger restaurant- the slightly-singed, but otherwise-delicious smell of meat being grilled? This was a sick amplification of that. The smell alone was enough to drive several members of our party to pursue other options for dinner.



As far as decor, the restaurant does a good job of sticking to an anti-doctor theme, with signs plastered all over the restaurant warning you of the unhealthy nature of their food, mandatory patient gowns for all diners, and waitresses dressed as cute nurses. 



But the food itself could be summed up with the word ""Sickening,"" which actually works metaphorically and literally. Their shakes are incredibly sweet, but actually filled with ice cream, pure cream, and butter. Their fries are cooked in lard, and their burgers are excessively heavy and fattening. A burger and fries is really enough to fill up a fully-grown man, but the sensation of being completely filled by lard, meat, and grease is almost as disgusting as seeing one of the obese regulars scarf down a triple-bypass burger for free.



The next morning, most of us who'd eaten there were still full. One of my friends said he ""felt like [he] just blew the Hamburglar."" Starting with the smell, and lasting all the way to the aftertaste the next morning, this anti-hospital is as novel as it is grotesque and excessive. I seriously almost threw up twice before I even tried anything, but I like to exercise and eat healthy. Other people didn't seem as disturbed by the place as I did, and to HG's credit, the things they serve actually maintain a stronger semblance to edible food than some other places I've eaten. It will definitely fill you up, and the theme is kind of cute.



Nonetheless, I can't walk away from a restaurant feeling like I just destroyed my body and recommend it. I almost feel like the place is unethical for its  choice to give such flagrantly unhealthy meals. At the same time, the place is called HEART ATTACK Grill, and they don't make any effort to pretend they're doing anything other than providing the most unhealthy and disgusting food possible. With that, and the friendly service in mind, I can't justify any rating lower than 2/5. I'd definitely like this place more if they just used fresh ingredients, didn't cover everything in nastiness, and just stuck to making good burgers, fries, and shakes...

but I realized that would just make them In-N-Out, and would kind of ruin everything this restaurant stands for.



Disgusting? Yes.

Necessary? No.

Immoral? Decidedly no, since they clearly warn you about what you're getting in to.

I'm not that big into burgers, but I had to try this place ever since I've seen it on the Travel Channel.  I was a little scared since this place cooks everything in LARD, but when in Rome...



This place gets a 2 stars for a couple of reasons.  First, the burger I had wasn't that great.  It tasted like a back yard bbq session.  I was expecting a little bit more.  Second, after we got done eating my other friends felt like crap the whole day.  I believe they spent some time with the porcelain seat back at our hotel...



The only thing that saved this place from the 1 star is the Fries and the Shakes.  The fries are pretty good and its bottomless.  Maybe it was the LARD it was cooked in but the fries had a unique taste.  The Vanilla Shake I had was good.  My friends had the Strawberry Shake and can attest to its goodness as well.



The best part of the Heart Attack Grill is........THE NURSES!  If it wasn't for them, I would have walked out of this place as soon as I bit into my burger.  Good Gimmick bad burger!",negative

And duh your going to see sexy nurses and a unique restaurant concept that is telling you to eat so unhealthy it will kill you.  Its expensive for the food you receive but worth the novelty of it and the few pictures you leave with. 



Food - 3/10 - Take my word and other yelp comments the burger is nothing special.  The meat is very bland and has no memorable seasoning or sauce (yawn).  For a ""burger"" joint when calories are no concern you think it was the most amazing flavor ever.  It's not.  Burger Guru's go elsewhere.  The fries were a huge disappointment as well.  I went with 6 other people.  We all blamed the soggy fries on being the ""bottom"" of the pan.  We got more unlimited fries when a fresh batch came out and no one loved them at all.  Its funny cause there is a video playing on flat screens and when we saw the crispy looking fries on screen we were like 'we want those!'.  The milkshakes were also disappointing because people expected more flavor like thick ice cream.  It was a very generic base that they just pump flavored syrup into, no blenders.  Also, people that dined the same day as us found a hair ball in the double burger.  It was pretty gross when he held it up and the nurses came running to replace!  I cant wait for his review!



Who will go again?  0 out of 6 of us.



Who is talking about this place to their friends and family? 6 out of 6 of us.



Who felt a little sick to their stomachs? 4 out of 6 of us.



Overall go once have fun.

Please redeem yourself, it's just embarrassing! Restore honor in the name of the Pho# community, which extends all the way to SoCal.  



It was this 2-star recipe that I observed:



1) Adding a dash of Black Pepper before my pho bowl arrives. Who does that? Trust me, nobody in my pho eating career have I seen this.  You either: a) believed your broth lacked flavors b) thought it was cool and tried to be different? If needed, we can use the shakers that was already sitting on the table. Clearly, a Pho Faux Pas.



It threw everything off.  Slurp after slurp was quite painful.  The identity of the broth was more evident once I added the hoisin and siracha: bland-ish.  Hence the BP? *face palm*



2) Empty Tables and Chairs.  Clearly, this was a dead giveaway but I was semi hopeful that the Pho Gods would bring me good tasting fortunes on this great Sunday afternoon. *face palm*



3) SERVICE was so SLOOOOW, I thought at several points TIME itself had STOPPED.  In comparison to some legendary Viet places I know, I get my cup of water the second I sit down or atleast within reasonable time.  10 minutes before taking order, 10 more minutes for beverage to arrive. *face palm*



If you are truly a Pho place, it shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to deliver a bowl of Pho.  In fact, the vegetables took just as long to come out.  The anti-freshness did not help either! You would think being directly linked to an Asian Grocery would help in that regard.  *face palm*



No excuse for slowness when the place is half full.



Another thing, please invest in better Rooster and Hoisin sauces, not your mysterious, generic bottle.  *face palm*



All of this face palming has caused my face to go numb! The only way I would return is if a ONE was added to the restaurant number.  By then I would expect an enhancement in the food and possibly a scandalous atmosphere. ;-)

My Experience:



Walked in to a funky smell.. decided to risk eating here despite the fishy stench.



Seated. Water Delivered.. at this time my wife and I knew what we wanted, so we ordered. Wife gets chicken pho.. I order the Bun Bo Hue, and our waiter tells me they are out of pork blood. We also order spring rolls.



5 minutes later another couple is seated near us. Their order is taken.



5 minutes later that other couple gets their food delivered.



5 minutes later, our food is delivered! 



I find it odd that the other couple received their food before my wife and I. The quality of meat in my soup was questionable (color of the meat not what I have experienced before..almost a greenish color). The broth was decent though. My wife liked her pho, but mentioned that it was not as good as our other 2 preferred soup spots.

My husband, who is white, said ""this taste just like chicken broth"" and thats what it really was, chicken broth!!! I almost wanted to ask if they accidently put the wrong soup broth in our bowls it was so bad. we were so disappointed and it was pretty pricey. I now know why Asians don't come here.",negative

I tried the onion rings and found them to be large and without much flavor.  The problem with the coleslaw is that they chop the cabbage too finely and it turns out more like a mush than a salad.

Still, Brak and I go here with Bob the Programmer for breakfast after a round of golf because it's close to the course. There really isn't any other reason to visit.



On our last visit, we had a horrible time getting the attention of our waiter. Our drink glasses were bone dry, and we couldn't flag anyone down to fill them. We did catch the attention of the 3 year old at the next table, which is the last thing I want -- I prefer my peace. As is typical at Cracker Barrel, every meal was served on about three plates, so we quickly ran out of table space and had to navigate and consolidate in order to maneuver.



On our previous visit, our waitress stank. Not a working-so-hard-that-she's-getting-a-little-sweaty stink, but a I-can't-believe-she-hasn't-been-fired stench. Every time she approached our table, we held our breath and talked about leaving. Seriously appalling. (Note that we did come back -- I don't know why either.)



The food is mediocre at best. Everything is bland and white, though I discovered that a nice yogurt and fruit parfait. I can't even imagine what anyone would order for lunch or dinner.



I don't have much to say that's good about Cracker Barrel, but I'll try. It has a big parking lot. There are at least 20 paths from the restaurant to do front door, so if you can get past the hostess station, you can always navigate around the gummers and the kids.

I give J the task on figuring out where to go, and he suggests Logan's or Cracker Barrel. I think, OOH there's a Famous Dave's there and Papa LOVES bbq. So, I throw that idea out there as well. But since the g-rents also like ""southern home cookin"", we went to Cracker Barrel. 



We arrive to find no host at the station and end up standing around for about 5 minutes with no one in sight. Finally, what looks like a manager, comes by and says....Someone will be with you shortly. Wow, really? Finally, the host arrives to his station, and we are escorted to a table. 



We wait for our server to come by the table. 10 minutes or so and still no server. Finally another server stops and asks us if we've been helped. J replies firmly, ""No, we have not!"" The server asks us for our drink order and comes back a few minutes later with our beverages. He says that ""our server"" was complaining about another table, or was complaining about another table complaining, so he was going to take our table. Okay, cool cause we're hungry. 



J orders the Meatloaf. I get the Chicken Fried Chicken with the gravy on the side. Grams orders the Grilled Chicken Tenders Dinner. And Papa orders the BBQ sandwich. We distract ourselves for the moment with that puzzle game while we wait for our biscuits and cornbread, which finally arrived with our meal. 



Grams dinner - She said everything tasted fine. 

Papa's dinner - His bbq sandwich was according to him (he does NOT hold back when it comes to his opinions, especially food) dry, stringy, tough, and under seasoned. I asked our server for a side of bbq sauce so he could eat. 

My dinner - The only thing decent was the Okra and the Apples. The Mac and Cheese had what looked like black plastic in it. After I got done picking it out and putting it on the side of my plate, it looked to be about 1/3 c of the black crap. I told J, ""What the hell is this!?"" 

J's dinner - The meatloaf was bone dry. The mashed potatoes and gravy were cold. Literally, the gravy was congealed. 



J was fed up, and he got up to seek out a manager. The manager came back and was combative with him. He said, the black stuff was cheese. REALLY?! Since when is cheese the consistency of melted plastic and black in color?! He offered to have our meals replaced. A few minutes later, our dinners come out. J says that it looks much better. I pick through the Mac and Cheese and find no black crap. Alright!! Let's chow! Not even 30seconds later, J's sitting there staring at his mashed potato loaded fork in front of his face. I look over and immediately start laughing. Its a HAIR! You've got to be kidding! 



The server comes by a few seconds later and says, ""How's everything..."" and stops mid sentence. He sees J staring at something on the fork. ""Oh no, that's not good"" our server says. He goes off to get the manager. I cant stop laughing. 

I cut into my chicken, and without looking take a bite. Hmmm, something was off. I look down and yeah, that's not chicken fried chicken. Its chicken fried steak, which I LOATHE. I just think tenderized meat tastes like its already been chewed. 



The manager comes by and apologizes for everything and says our dinner's are free (including my grandparents). You're Dayumn'ed right they better be free!! We do leave our server a tip, since the quality of our dinner was not in anyway his fault.

She was trying to be what I thought overly friendly but as it turned out she was very inept and may have been under the influence. She would not make eye contact with me as she handed the menu's to us.(which is fine with me) but what was odd was that she wanted to stay and chat with us with languorous meaningless conversation.  She took our order then I was amazed that she brought a tray within a five minutes to our table. She proceeded to place the food in front of us and I noticed I had  sides that were not mine but what my wife had order.  Marva apologized and went to retrieve another plate when my wife discovered she had something she did not order. When Marva returned we told her that we had the wrong dinners.  Then she picked 

up two of the plates and went to the kitchen. Just then a waiter comes to us with a tray that had our order on it.  I explained that Marva had made a mistake and he then rudely asked if I had eaten some of the dinner that Marva had taken back. When Marva retruned she was apologetic. But then she said ""well with all that has gone on I think I should know you people and should just sit with you and visit""  Believe me it was the last thing my wife and I wanted was to have this inept rambling .waitress sit with us.  We finished our dinner and Marva brought our check she asked us if we wanted a refill of ice tea.. It would have been nice to have had it with our meal when we finally got what we ordered.

It took over 20 minutes just to get our drink order taken. We had a couple people stop by and say, someone will be right with you, someone will be right with you. We finally had another server stop by and start to take our drink order. People who had arrived after us were getting their drinks and salads already. Since we'd been waiting forever at this point someone said can we just go ahead and order while we're at it? And started placing their order. By the time the waitress got around to the last person (my sister) she was very impatient. Since my sister had some questions about the menu she started asking some polite questions (What comes with this dish? Can I sub this for that?) The waitress literally said ""Could you please hurry up? I have other tables to wait on."" My sister sat there with her mouth open, flabbergasted that someone would be that rude to her especially since we were getting crappy service already. 



By the time the rude waitress (I think her name was Bobby?) finally got our order in and it came out (forever later, no refills on drinks) my order of 1/2 lb. hamburger was wrong and I got a hamburger steak? I think they just took it to the back and put a bun on it but I don't care, I was hungry. My fiance finally gets up to get a manager to explain the extremely lousy and rude service we received and we ended up getting the entire 5 meals comp'd. I don't think we saw our ""actual"" server the entire time we were there. The oddest thing about this whole thing is that the restaurant wasn't even busy. They had sections closed off. Our waitress had only 5 tables or so seated during the time we were there.  We ended up tipping the hostess a couple bucks because she was the only person who competently (not that there's much competition here) did her job.

Open letter to Adam Carmer -- Hotel School Professor and (allegedly) Restaurateur:



Dear Mr. Carmer, 



BBQ margaritas aren't enough to sustain or build a restaurant -- let alone a good or truly satisfied restaurant clientele.  Good food, genuine service, great values are.  Your Maryland Parkway operation is a joke.  Please, if you want your substantial investment in this location (which is much appreciated, by the way)  to matter, tap into your healthy employee base (I'm sure you have a few employees who would be interested in picking up some add'l shifts), and bring some experienced talent over.  Better yet -- you don't need a hostess/manager/multiple servers when you have (ahem) NO BUSINESS.   Get those girls on the floor -- teach them about the food and make them earn their money.  Simply reprinting menu placemats does not build business -- oh, yeah, you might have the girls read the menus too...understanding your food and the things that matter to you.  I've found, as I've meandered through the food business, that typically it's helpful, and your customers appreciate it when staff can answer questions, instead of staring at you like you've asked them to create world peace on a plate.   



Oh and in case you thought I was pussyfooting around the issue, I won't -- fire the spiky haired kid -- seriously.  Foodservice is not his calling.  I'm sure something is -- but do him, you (and your guests) a favor and please, please cut the chord so that no one has to put up with his lame excuses, and worse than that his mind bending business-ending behavior ever again.   



And you might drop me a note when he's gone -- maybe then I'll return.  Yep, that bad.



One more thing, your cook at the Flamingo location cooks circles around -- your crew at Maryland Parkway.   Oh, and from what I've seen, he can run the whole damn place singlehandedly -- and is happy and proud to do so.  His food is worth returning for -- as is his attitude.  Send him over to fix Maryland Parkway, or it's truly doomed.  Better yet,  get yourself in there to run things.  Throw the rest of them out, and show us what it is that you know.  Introduce yourself to your guests -- hell there are only about 2 of them, so it shouldn't tax you too much.  Maybe then you'll begin to rebuild your business the old fashioned way, one happy customer at a time.",negative
ts111,9/24/2008,revtest1353,1,"I order ""large beef ribs"" to go (about $16)....which comes with two sides to be chosen from a list of sides that are listed on the menu at $1.99 each. 



I want sweet potato fries which is not on the list of sides that comes with the order and is listed on the menu at $2.99. 



So I do quick math in my head, and ask the barman if I can trade the two $1.99 sides for one $2.99 side. I figure with a net gain of $.99 to the house, it would be an easy call. The barman politely says 'can't do it.'



So I call one of the management staff over; his name is Rob. I tell him what I want to do. He says 'can't do it'. 



I point out it's a trade in his favor. He says 'still can't do it'. 



I say 'but you're going to have an unhappy customer'. He says again 'can't do it'.



I should have walked out then and there, but I was starving, so I took the order with the two ""fascist"" sides.

What I don't get is the awful food. This was my FIRST (and last) visit into this franchise restaurant. How they convinced franchisees and the general public to invest and vote with hard earned dollars is beyond me.



I took my friends 11 year old there after he played in a b'ball game and after looking at the menu and pricing decided to split the rib eye special $19.99. 



I got the fried pickle appetizer as well and was sorely disappointed in the batter and both of the ""dipping sauces"" (watery ranch and thousand island? I really couldn't tell).  Even a franchise like H***ers makes them WAY better......wow.



On to the main course. The baked potato with butter and cream cheese was overcooked or something? I have never had a potato that seemed to have been soaked in some type of brine and then baked? Kind of par boiled or something. Anyway the color was greyish and the taste like that of a fishy sea salt.



Moving to the broccoli i was greeted by a palor yellow looking presentation. I couldn't tell if it was cheesy cauliflower or ? Wow the taste was again that of something really overcooked or under matured...YICK



The last chance at redemption came with the medium well rib eye. Good sized portion and easily split between the two of us 20oz. Good wholesome beefy taste and great texture only to be squallored  by a heavy Saltiness....not sure where this was picked up from but maybe by hanging out too close to the potato?

We arrived at 6:00PM (despite the holiday, I had to work all day). Prior to being seated I inquired about the Veteran's Day specials and I was bluntly told, by a person in authority, that the restaurant was 'NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF GIVING FREE MEALS AWAY.' ... and that their Veteran's Day specials had ended at 4:00PM... I was also told that the restaurant had gone out of their way to open early for the holiday, which implied that as an Armed Forces Veteran, I was an imposition... the supervisor offered me a 10% discount as a baseless, contrary aside... I never got any discount, by the way.



I was quite frank in expressing my position that I did not expect a 'free meal',' nor did I appreciate the condescending tone of the remark . To be clear: I did not ask for a free meal; I inquired about the specials that they had promoted to honor my military service, and I was promptly rebuked. 



To the serving staff's credit, they recognized my daughter's birthday in a thoughtful and appropriate fashion. The food was good, and consistent with countless previous visits.



I am a longtime fan of the chain, but in light of this experience, I am inclined to more carefully consider my dining-out choices. 



Based on the representation of the supervisor I spoke with, I am firmly of the opinion that the 'Veteran's Day'  promotion they offered was a shallow, indifferent, and insincere ploy to get business on the holiday, and not an earnest offering in appreciation of my, or any other Veteran's, sacrifices on this occasion.

The waitress gave us good service.  Can't really fault her for that.

My hubby and I both ordered a sirloin.  the waitress said it was one of their most popular things.  Both of us ordered medium.  We both found the steak dry and mealy.  I guess that is what you get for 12$.  We also got the onion appetizer, which was very salty and seemed to have been ready to go before we ordered it.

We got baked potatoes, loaded, which were tasty.  But why does loaded cost extra? Is the menu price for a dry potato?  It does not say on the menu what you are getting with it.  And the steak, we both got fried mushrooms (more$) and my husband got onions (more$) that were not really even fried.  Still white.

Overall, the bill came to 45$.  That is a lot of little add-ons.  We had iced tea for drinks. 

Just disappointing that you go to a place that prides themselves on their hand-cut steaks, and these were that bad.  And all the little things they add on....... just too much.  

Next time, I'll just go somewhere that is a little more pricey and has a better steak.

I must preface this sad review with the note that I was so super excited to eat here, I looked forward to coming for days and days while we had other obligations. But this place was a huge disappointment. The first problem we encountered was showing up at 8:30 PM. I admit I like to dine late, but Montreal is a late city - I have never heard of a resto closing so early. The problem was their website and door said they close at 9. But the owner, who was really nice and yet surly at the same time, said he could not seat us because they were closing at 9. So days went buy until I could return. I was really excited about the idea of having French-ethnic food...something Montreal should specialize in. But I later found out that this restaurant serves food from Guyana, not French Guyana - so it is actually a British colony. And we all know how British food is. Maybe that explains what we found - some of the most bland, tasteless, unspiced food I have ever eaten. 



This was not Caribbean food that I am familiar with; I worked one summer in Canarsie, Brooklyn - a huge Trinidadian community, where I dined on splendid roti every lunchday...beautifully spiced, wonderfully tasty food. I Not here. To be fair, we are vegetarian, and only had the chick pea and potato roti and main course (which was exactly the same, sans roti)...and I heard some repeat customers come in after us and order it with pumpkin. Apparently this is off-menu. And they did provide a bottle of hot sauce on the table. But the problem is that the hot sauce is too damn hot...and the food itself unspiced...so you have a choice of burn-your-mouth spicy or tasteless.



And because I can't review a place without talking about atmosphere - they make an attempt here but it is a kind of pathetic one.

The poutine was a disappointment but alright. Not enough gravy to cover all the fries and the cheese curds were alright but not in enough abundance either. Their fries though are quite good and I do like the dips they have but I ordered a poutine, not fries and dip you bumbaclot...



The burger as well is a rip off and not fresh. They don't even try to hide the fact it's a frozen patty which to me is kind of lame...At least have some pride.

The fries were already getting cold and mushy, the gravy was a strange orangey-brown color, but at least the cheese curds held their squeak. 



For $9, I was left wanting much more. Even after sharing with two friends, several fries and too much gravy were left at the bottom of the box.

My wife was off eating with friends, and I was on my own for dinner. Since Reuben's was close to my hotel and well-reviewed, that was where I'd planned on eating.



After arriving, I informed the hostess that I wanted a table for one, and that I would be happy to sit at the bar since they were busy. She took my name, told me it would be 20 minutes, and directed me to the waiting area. I waited. After she began seating people who came in after me at the bar, I asked why I'd been passed over. She looked at her sheet and said I had accidentally been overlooked. She told me they would have me seated within 15 minutes. 



What?! I asked her if she was serious and she nodded dismissively.



Having no backup plan for dinner, I decided to wait it out. 20 minutes later, it happened again. A group that came in after me was seated. I asked if I'd been skipped again and her response was, ""It appears so.""

I consider myself an amateur foodie and I'm always looking for a gem and this place was not even close.  The first problem I had with this place is that it was located in a dreary basement 2 stories below ground level.  On first entrance you feel like you've walked into a cheap diner from the 50's.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and that was where the niceties stopped.  Our waiter was quite unfriendly and he took 10 minutes to come and take our order even though the restaurant was basically empty on a Monday night.



My friend and I ordered the smoked meat sandwich hoping the food was better than the service.  Whoever said in their review that this was on par with Montreal's best smoked meat must be in the twilight zone or has had no experience tasting smoked meat in Montreal.  I realize that comparing any place to Schwartz's seems rather cliche but the truth is there is no comparison.  There are plenty of other places that don't serve overcooked smoked meat on terrible bread with tasteless mustard like Reuben's does.



The last point I will make is the fact that I ordered a garden salad instead of fries and they charged me $2.99 for the replacement.  Normally I wouldn't complain about this, though I think any restaurant should offer a replacement of fries with other side dishes at no charge, but the garden salad was absolutely horrendous.  It came in a cereal bowel and it was like I ordered 'ranch dressing with some romaine lettuce on the side'.  



They don't have any beer on tap so I ordered a heineken and my meal ended up costing almost $30 with tip.  This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had and I would not recommend eating here.  The only reason they get 2 stars is because they do serve you enough food to fill you up if you can stomach it.",negative

I decided to go for the smoke meat sandwich, as it is ""their specialty"". The meat was poorly seasoned, over salted, and whey over cooked.



The service was the worse I have experienced in a long time. The staff working that day all looked like they wanted to shoot themselves, and our waiter was really unpleasant, taping his pencil on his pad when we were making decisions about what to take...and it's not like he was in a rush, cause the place was basically empty...

It just sees as if some random Auntie and Uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of Indian food thinking: ""These dumb Americans have no clue. We will call it Chicken Tikha Masala wrap and they will think it's cool""  



I'm Indian and i had a hunch this place was like that but I was bored and decided to pay them a visit and try this authentic food. After all, if the food is great, then I could care less if it's faux Indian food.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala ""bowl""  I asked them if they could add some sauce to it and the owner responded: ""Yes, many customers have asked me to do that so we started to do that""  First of all, chicken tikka masala without sauce is like eating chicken soup without water...it doesn't exist.  And what makes this story even more odd is that when I got the chicken with the supposed added sauce...it was still dry.  It had literally one teaspoon worth of sauce over some very dry and poorly cooked rice.  And I paid 10 bucks for that.  Needless to say I didn't go back.



Look, I'm not insulting your intelligence. I know you have eaten Indian food at an actual sit down Indian restaurant and that this is supposed to be good in it's own manner as a pseudo fast food version of Indian. Hey, fast food Indian...love the concept...I'm down with that....unfortunately, it's already being done in bigger cities and it's much better.  Even fast food indian has more flavor than this place.

When I questioned I got every excuse in the book. I was told all the orders in front of us were called in. When I mentioned that I saw they lost our ticket she gave me another excuse. I asked for my money back and she said our meal would be up next then gave me two free lunch tickets.

After tasting the incorrect almond croissant I asked for the correct one to be brought out.  She snagged the plate and then disappeared.  Actually, most of the time she was disappeared which is an amazing feat for an empty restaurant.



When the correct croissant finally came out it was cold.  C'mon.... seriously?  I asked for it heated up and received barely lukewarm.  Suffice it say, my tip reflected her total lack of caring.  I'm done with this place.  If I want French I'll go to Georges Brasserie and if I want pastries then I'll go to Amelie's.",negative

Was in for dinner recently, service was good, wine was good but at $14 a glass for  Sauv Blanc over priced. I had the ""herb roasted"" chicken.... dry, and flavorless. She ordered the crab cakes which were a style I have Never seen before ... 3 round disks that were flattened beyond recognition maybe 1/4"" thick, total weight Maybe 2 oz! Half the plate was filled with red pepper aioli ... ( mayo and canned red peppers) seriously the mayo was twice the weight and surface area of the crab pancakes ?? I guess the ""crab"" was the accompaniment ?? the remainder of the plate was filled with spinach that was barely warmed and wilted mixed with very obviously canned peppers and nothing was done to hide that fact. We rarely complain, but did this time, the server ( Caroline I think) was very good about it. The replacement pasta was better but not by much.

We were told to pick any table but the problem is that all of them had not been cleaned since the last customer.  We sat at a table with someone's leftovers for about 10 minutes and no one came out to bus the table.  When I went back in to speak with the hostess, I told her we had moved to a less dirty table.  Once we sat down at our new table, I knew it would be an interesting meal.  I swear we were sitting right next to the Real Housewives of Charlotte.  Each woman had downed a bottle of wine and their conversation was very loud and obnoxious.  Then, my mimosa came out with what looked like a pubic hair hanging off of the side - yum.

My husband got the large portion of mussels and frites and while the broth was good, the portion was quite small.

ts122,7/21/2013,revtest1428,2,"The side of sauteed Spinach was incredibly salty otherwise the color was wonderful and it smelled great. The side of sauteed mushrooms looked really good, but they were way too peppery. I never season my food, when its cooked right there isn't any need to but whoever made those dishes had a very heavy hand. I NEVER leave food behind and I didn't even finish half of them. 



I had to ask for a steak knife. Waited until someone bothered to make eye contact with me to ask for it by the way. The steak was cooked perfectly - rare just the way I like it and the texture wonderful. The thin french fries were great too, very good! Flavor, texture etc. but as I ate the steak there was way too much seasoning on it as well. Seasoning shouldn't over power the flavor of a good cut of meat and this did. 



The biggest issue I had: the staff really needs a lesson in professionalism. I heard one woman behind me talk about a female condom which was just PART of their conversation. They were all huddled in the back while there were people at tables on the floor. Totally turned me off. I saw waitress and waiter in disagreement in the middle of the dining area while setting up a table. One couple complained they had been sitting there ignored. The gentleman got up and said something to a waiter and the manager came over and appeared to make amends in a grandiose way.  My own waiter walked by and for some reason never made eye contact. I was not sure why  - to be clear I NEVER give anyone a hard time nor am I anything other than friendly. Even if the service and food are not up to par. 



I was seated in the back, on the left (if you are facing the kitchens) so had a birds eye view - and ear - to everything. I told one friend that I actually felt like I was in restaurant boss type episode and there was a hidden camera somewhere, it was that ridiculous with the staff and how they were acting. 



The Manager must have realized I heard what I shouldn't have heard because he gave me a box of free pastries and apologized. The staff treated him, quite honestly? - like crap. It was embarrassing. The fact that those kids (some of them - others adults) acted in such a manner in a restaurant that I'd heard NOTHING but rave reviews about? It was disappointing. 



The fact I heard him trying to discipline them - they ignored him - was probably not smart on his part either. He seemed frazzled and angry and just disgusted. Lets just say the atmosphere that night was a 1 star. If the staff acts up like that? Get them in the kitchen and send them home, don't do it where patrons can hear.



In all fairness maybe (hopefully for the owner) this was not a regular occurrence because friends of mine RAVE about this place. For breakfast and dinner saying it was one of their favorites. I went on a Coupon to try it out, and at first loved the atmosphere but it went downhill from there. I also can't see paying that kind of money for a meal that was ""eh"" 



I always eat every bite on my plate and I savor each one. I didn't take anything with me except the free pastries and my french fries. 



I judge a place on different criteria and I have a sensitive palate and nose. LOVE food. To cook it, eat it, buy it, read about it etc. I think I am a good judge of what I see, taste, smell and - hear.



I'd recommend other places before this one for DINNER - may consider giving them a shot for breakfast type fare and will say the ONE WONDERFUL thing - the best thing about this place - the desserts. They were a little stale but it was after 9pm so that isn't a biggie in my book. 



I bought a slice of Carrot cake and Tiramisu - the waiter had closed my bill without asking me about desserts at all by the way......I watched a waitress across the room RAVE about them to a full table of people ( I was solo) and she had me craving them. He was going to give them to me for free because he closed the bill out. I insisted on paying for them and will tell you that it was ""THE BEST"" carrot cake I've ever had! I'd order a whole one for my birthday cake if I could. 



The free pastries the Manager gave me? Macaroons are awesome almond cakes too and croissants with chocolate in them. I would recommend this place as a BAKERY and I may give them a shot - after hearing a friend say the crepes were really good - for breakfast. However, not my first choice or even second for Dinner.

I keep wanting to like this place.  Nice décor and while the menu isn't large, there are many things on it that sound great.  This time I ordered the mussels and the duck confit.  Both were very disappointing.  The mussels came out in an unappealing cream sauce that I can very easily trump at home.  The duck confit was just so so and did not have much flavor.  How duck fried in duck fat isn't an explosion of flavor is beyond me.  I find the frozen duck confit from Reids to be much better.  I do have to give them credit for their starter bread, however.

Now I'll be honest.  I probably didnt order the right thing....although the guy taking my order acted like what I was ordering was off the charts.  It wasnt close.  I wanted something that wasnt fried so my selections were limited and they were all really expensive for a fast food ""Order at a counter"" kinda place.  I had the trout.  It came with a strange macaroni salad which I wouldn't touch if my life depended on it, but I am strange that way.  No other options were offered and I walked out $14 poorer and hungrier than when I arrived.  



I would guess that the combo platters would have been more satisfying or even just the straight up fried cod with fries.  But I wasnt looking to feel like a walking grease pit on my way home so I wanted to stick with something fairly healthy.

Wednesday evening - is it the new 'little Saturday'? It was surprisingly busy, but luckily my husband had reserved a table. Hmm.. the only table they had happened to be just near the entrance, so every time somebody came in there was a strong gust of wind and the poor candle on our table blew out (twice). My friend sat with her coat on the whole time!



I asked if we could maybe move to a different table, but I was told that there were other people queuing for tables. Fair enough.



King's Wark always have daily specials (fish and seafood). I was trying to decide between wild grilled trout and pheasant - I chose the latter.  Oh, I should have maybe gone for the trout.. The dish arrived eventually and it came with gnocchi, beetroot jelly and winter greens. Gnocchi was delicious, I think it was the best part of the meal. Beetroot jelly didn't really do much to the dish, rather than adding a little bit of colour.  The pheasant unfortunately was chewy and tough - disappointing. I didn't finish it, as it just wasn't pleasant to eat. Also it didn't have much flavour. 



I'm not much of a complainer (except on Yelp) so I thought that once they come to clear up the plates, I will let them know about the pheasant. However, busy as they were - this never happened. Nobody came to ask how the meal was.

I've had my best ever fishnchips, best ever smoked haddock risotto, and many great girly lunches here over the years. But years ago, not recently. 



I came in about 2 months ago with a hangover for a decent Bloody Mary and decided food would be ok. But the battered fish was sswiimmmiinnng in fat and i could barely scrape the tiny bits of fish off of the horribly burned batter. Put it down to a bad day.



This time we were very surprised to get a table at all as it was a v sunny night at 7.30pm  and the shore was very very busy. But we did, which now I know speaks volumes. The hot smoked salmon starter was a massive plate of salad leaves, giant chunks of very smoked salmon, an egg and 2 half stalks of asparagus. Not terrible but totally over saladed and inderseasoned, and far too large.



For mains we had a salmon  risotto, which turned out to be savoury rice pudding with a salmon fillet plonked on top! Totally horrible. If your chef can't do risotto, don't offer it on the menu, The other was a scallop, crevette and squid salad main. First off the chips were forgotten and i had to go chase them, but when they were eventually brought they were barely cooked. The scallops tasted of NOTHING and the crevettes, although covered in herbs of some kind, tasted of nothing. The squid the same. This was a salad that was charged at more the double of the starter size version due to the addition of chips, apparently....the forgotten chips i had to chase that eventually arrived totally undercooked..



To be fair, the waitress seemed keen to know why we hadn't eaten anything, but my dining partner had decided we wouldn't cause a fuss or scene. I still told her I'd not all enjoyed my main and that the late chips were totally underdone and generally i'd not had an enjoyable meal. We asked for the bill. She offered us a free coffee. and then ignored us for ages. Eventually we got to pay and leave. A full bill with nothing taken off.

I went for their Gourmet Beef Burger with Caramelised Red Onion, Monterey Jack Cheese and washed it down with a pint of St. Andrews Clock Brew.



The Burger was cooked just right (at my request) and was very tasty. The ""Classic Burger sauce"" (with the burger inside the bun) was the perfect accompaniment. The ""Chips"" were rather over cooked for my liking (they were far from fresh). I wouldn't say they were tough, but they could easily have been used as nails on a coffin lid. Also, the dip that came with the chips had been sitting around for a while as it has an all too evident skin on top. I tasted the dip once, very bland.



The Beer was perfectly poured with just a tiny head on it, delicious, hoppy and chocolatey.



The service was, er, prompt. The folk who work here are way, way too reserved, not rude, just reserved and have a real need of a sense of humour and should at least try to smile.



One glaring error I just have to mention, cleanliness is not an option, but, a crucial, née vital necessity. The table decoration was a clear glass bowl with glass pebbles and the top of a flower, it was beyond grubby and dirty. I would not like to guess when it was last cleaned. Also, I had asked to move tables due to the air con being too strong. One of the staff had an (evidently dirty) tea towel hanging from his belt, he just grabbed that and gave the most casual of swishes to the table (no spray was used), very unhygienic indeed, there was no telling where that tea towel had been before, or, what it had been used for.



The menu is, weird and seemed to be a hash of several menus from different decades, nothing really gelled, or made much sense.

I was then told that they don't have hot dogs. Confused, I reiterated what I was told earlier about waiting for the buns but was ignored & told that they don't have either. Another worker had showed up & entered our conversation asking, ""do you REALLY want a hot dog?"", which to me says, ""we're closing soon & we don't really want to correct what we did wrong, but I'll offer it up with a bit of sarcasm anyway"".  That also pissed me off just a bit. So, I ended up eating the other half of the pastrami sandwich (which was ok, not the best pastrami ever, by any means).

I ate a couple bites and didn't finish that either.  I would never go to this bar/restaurant hungry again.  The food in the establishment will never pass these lips.",negative

Being a fan of Chandler bars like the Pecos Lounge and ... well ... the Pecos Lounge, I was shocked to see this sqeaky-clean, themed, yuppie bar in a neighborhood that used to mean death for white people.



As my drinking buddy noted, ""I know it's an Irish pub, but do they need to beat you over the head with it?"" Green backlit alcohol displays, racist comedy on the video screens, Shamrocks and green crap all over the place ... please stop.



Also, I hate when bartenders need refer to a video screen to place my order and give me a total. It was a gin and tonic and a whiskey Coke. You should be able to do that in your head, take my money and let me go have fun.",negative
ts127,3/8/2011,revtest1454,2,"All right...  So I go to an ""Irish"" bar/pub for one reason and one reason only.  To have irish whiskey.

So when I ask what types of irish they have I get the answer ""Bushmills and Jameson""  Just regular old Bushmills and Jameson.  Not even the top shelves of each brand, just the boring old shopping at Walgreens brands of irish whiskey.  



So I have a new ""Irish"" bar that I hang out at.  It has a way better and deeper selection of Irish whiskey.  It's called Fry's Grocery store.  I'll be getting my Irish on in the frozen food section.",negative

It took 29 minutes from the time we sat down to get out lunch. The waitress had no sense of urgency until we found another server and the bartender to enlist some help.



We had our baby and 7-yr old with us, so the more time that passed the more out-of-control they got. It was quite agitating.



It took maybe 10 minutes for our drink order to come out.



The only thing saving this from a 1-star review is the food. The food was very tasty. We ordered wings, a chicken breast, and the cheese/tomato sandwich.

ts127,8/24/2011,revtest1456,2,"hate having to do this but there has been a lot of changes at Murphy's in the last year, none of which I can report as being good. This place used to be consistently great with service and food but I'm sad to say it's not anymore. 



Began earlier this summer when the food started being hit or miss. Some days it was the stellar food we all came in to have at lunch and other days... not so good. To the point that the last three times were bad and the large group of us haven't gone back and probably won't. The food thing came down to if a certain chef was working - if he was there, good; if not, bad. Started asking the waitresses and figured out the trend. 



Fast forward to today and that chef has left and no longer works there. Which leads me to understand why the last 3 times in a row the food has been subpar. Like what makes a tomato hard? wasn't green or unripe but hard like... tough to cut hard. wtf? I don't know enough to know this is a reason the food has got worse but typically if you're looking to franchise you get different food vendors that can deliver the same type of food to your locations all across the country. So think frozen foods instead of more fresh stuff etc. I mean it makes sense.

Also when you have a trained Chef quit whom made great food, and tailored to groups that wanted more expensive off the menu lunches and catered for local businesses & events... something's up. I can only assume it was the quality in food and the new direction... 



... meaning... I also found out (chandler news and biz journal) that Murphy's is wanting to franchising and changing their name to Irish Republic and some of what's going on inside. Girls with slightly different garb... kilt's and knee-high's. etc. Not so much breastaraunt-ish but similar.

Service... much like the food the service has gone down in quality. There never seems to be enough girls during what used to be the lunch rushes and an hour lunch quickly turns into 1:30 lunches waiting on fill-ups and food and the check. It's not horrible service, girls are nice and friendly, just slow. 



In summary:

Bartender did not know they had a chicken sandwich - he had to look at the menu. That should have been a warning to not order it I guess. The bun was good. The chicken was not seasoned - flavorless and full of connective tissue- no wonder the bartender never bothered to ask me how everything was... But only served a few fries - definitely not enough - ketchup bottle was sticky and empty. I ate half of my sandwich, drank half the beer and left.

I ordered one beer.  One.  ONE.  ""Do you want to keep your tab open?' the bartender asked.  Sure.  Why not.



10 minutes later my friends say ""This place kind of sucks [they're right], let's go!""



Hey bartender, can I close my tab?  ""Sure, let me just find your card.""



It's been 10 minutes.  One beer.  8pm on a Saturday, not 1am and mayhem.  Cant find it. ""We're getting it for you."" they tell me.  They're trying to act like they DIDN'T just lose my debit card.  



Finally 20 minutes later they ask me again for my name and what it looks like.  Can't find it.  Keep looking in the same five spots over and over like it's going to magically re-appear.  Can't find it.  



I'm so pissed at this point...I have no other way to pay for anything on me, when I go out I just bring my license and my card.  I need gas to get home.  I wanted to have a good night.  Nope, they ruined it.



I leave, tell them I'll be back in an hour.  Go to San Tan, where they don't lose cards after 10 minutes.  Go back to Irish Republic later.



""I dont know what to tell you man, it's like it just disappeared!""  I'm livid.  I'm probably being a dick to the guy that tells me that.  I tell him I have no money to get home now, because of their irresponsibility.  ""Yeah we'll keep looking.""  



When I tell him he can probably call off the search because it's incredibly obvious that they didn't LOSE my card, they GAVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE, he shakes his head.  ""No that certainly didn't happen.  It's here man.  Sorry!""

The only problem was that when we I got the bill there were tons of drinks on it that were not ours. 



We had been sitting on the patio and anyone that we would talk with who randomly stopped by our table and ordered a drink, we would end up with the drink on our tab. We also had another friend stop by and get drinks and we actually watched him pay his tab, but there his drinks were at the end of the night. This service was horrible. The waitress wasn't willing to do anything about this to help us. Our bill ended up being nearly $300!!! Granted about 200 of it was ours between food and our drinks, but they were never able to explain the other drinks on our bill. 



The next day I called the manager and he stated he would take a look at it and get back to me. He never did. I ended up eating the cost on this one and just chalking it up to a place that I'll never return to. 



This happened a while back but since I am new to yelp, this experience was so terrible that I couldn't not give this place a review. I have to imagine that this has happened to several other people.

We did decided to get the pretzels with cheese, the cheese is $2 extra which I honestly think is kind of ridiculous because pretzels and cheese should be a given. They were not bad, not great but honestly I could get a pretzel that is a million times better and much bigger a few feet down the way at a particular brewing co...



On to the entrees. My sister had asked before I had arrived what the waitress suggested off of the menu. She suggested the fish and chips hands down. I should have also heeded this advice but I was kind of craving a burger so I decided to take a chance and order one. I should have known right away that it would not be what I wanted when Stephanie told me that they did not have american cheese. I am an american cheese burger type of girl, cheddar just doesn't cut it for me. The look on our waitress's face when I ordered the burger was one of disdain. I know that she did not purposely mean to make the face but she did. I honestly wish she would have told me not to order it. It was not good, it was very bad in fact. Dry, tasteless, overcooked meat with a semi hard bun. I should have sent it back but I instead decided to suffer through half of it which is retrospect and a stomach ache later, was a bad idea. I did eat most of the sweet potato fries that came with the burger with the $2 cheese sauce that was left over from the pretzel. It didn't make up for the disappointing burger. My sister did enjoy her fish and chips and the tarter sauce did look good as well.



Overall I have come to the conclusion that this is a restaurant/pub that is very hit or miss when it comes to food. If you want to come here to drink and have an appetizer or two you might enjoy your visit more. If you come here to eat dinner, by all means do not get a burger and I would also suggest to avoid the sliders. Honestly, you can find a much better meal a few steps down the sidewalk.

We stopped in today for lunch and my fiance ordered the chicken strips (which is the same thing he's ordered for the past 5 years that we've been going there), as usual he asked for extra dipping sauce (BBQ, Buffalo, and Jameson) instead of the ranch. Our server, who was actually very sweet, told us that she would have to charge us extra for the dipping sauce (which is bizarre because I've never heard of a restaurant charging for dipping sauce and we've never had an issue before). My finace proceeded to tell her that he's never been charged for it before and asked if she could double check on that. 



Next thing we knew, Shae (the manager) ""graced"" us with her presence. I've never seen anyone be more rude to a customer... If only her delivery was slightly nicer I wouldn't be as offended as I am now... After arguing with her for several minutes she finally agreed to substitute the ranch for 2 dipping sauces, but no more than two. So my fiance settled for the BBQ & the Buffalo sauce.



When the order came out however, not only was he brought the ranch that he didn't want, he was also brought all 3 of the sauces he originally asked for. Which at first seemed like a great sign that maybe Shae had decided to change her attitude and settle on the fact that the happiness of her customers was more important than her urge to be rude and belligerent. But then we got the bill... Sure enough, Shae charged my fiance for each one of the dipping sauces. 



When our server came back to collect the check, we asked her why we were charged after Shae had agreed to sub the ranch for 2 sauces. The poor girl got super uncomfortable, because unfortunately she was forced to play the middle man. So I told her that our issue was not with her, and to please bring Shae back to the table to sort this issue out. 



When Shae approached she started mumbling under her breath and rolling her eyes, which is always a great sign that you're going to get the resolution you're seeking... So I pulled out my phone and started video taping the conversation in case she decided to pull the same type of attitude as she did the first time she graced our table. That seemed to get her to change her tone and she reluctantly removed the sauces from our bill.

It was slammed, I don't blame him, but he was a total jerk! I tried to ask him a question after we ordered and he just ran off to key it into the system. When he came back I told him that we were sitting at the table by the stage and asked if he could bring it over... said I tried to tell you before you ran off. He responded with, ""no I can't. You can ask a server to bring it to you."". So I told him I tried to tell him before and then he said, I'll try. Just a total jerk... people don't need to be rude just cause they're busy. I've served many, many times and would never take my stress out on a guest. I told a server later what happened and she was really sweet and must have told her manager because he came over and apologized and said he would buy me nachos next time I came in. I told him, thanks but why not just comp them now since I never went to Chandler. He bought a round of shots for our table, instead. Definitely nothing there appealing to me to return.

ts127,12/26/2014,revtest1488,1,"Decided to stop by on Christmas Day about 5 pm because there was an hour wait at SanTan Brewery . We wanted to get some quick appetizers and hang out till our table was ready at the other restaurant. It was about 10 minutes until a frail looking blonde waitress (who looked like she needed something to eat and to maybe lay off whatever prescription drugs she was taking) came up and asked us if we were ready to order.... We hadn't even received menus yet, but asked for water while we looked them over. Another 7-10 minutes go by and she comes back, still hasn't dropped off our drinks and asked us if we were ready, we ordered 2 appetizers, she didn't write it down and left. My boyfriend ordered an epicenter and 55 minutes later we still have no appetizers and empty water cups. 



Side note: I can't put all the blame on the waitress, but whoever made the schedule for that day should be fired. There was 1 server, the bartender and what seemed to be the manager on duty. So 3 people running FOH on Christmas Day....  Just terrible planning. 



Btw-we never saw the blonde again. We watched as she was giving the wrong food/drinks to the wrong tables and walking around with a confused look on her face. 

We waved down (who we thought was) the manager on duty, a very nice brunette who seemed to be running the entire place, and asked the status of our order. She informed us that the blonde had never even rang it in and she'd get it to us ASAP, which she did and apologized profusely and took care of our meal for us.  We felt bad and wanted to leave her something but when we went to get money out of their ATM, it was out of service.

Let me start by saying the service and the restaurant were both excellent.  Clean restaurant that wasn't cluttered and had a great overall ambiance.



The menu had several choices and for a woodfire pizza place certain items seemed out of place.  A lot of seafood and greek style apps.  ""Tapas"" had a spot on the menu and consisted of things like Artichoke dip and Edamame??? Ok, not Firefly tapas for sure but still small plates... I guess.  The woodfire pizza that stuck out to me was the prosciutto.  At Settebello its my favorite so I figured I would compare.



No comparison needed, Settebello's prosciutto kills what I just ate.  The pizza wasn't terrible but it wasn't great in the same sense.  Little chunks of prosciutto and an over abundance of artichoke and green onion to mask the flavor of the prosciutto.  Also, if you look and the photo I uploaded you can tell there are way too many green onions on a couple of pieces than others.



For those movie fans out there, you all know from Casino with De Niro and Pesci ""you need an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin"" hahaha.  Overall, just didn't stick out as a place I would ever return to for pizza and its in the freakin name of the restaurant.... come on!!!",negative
ts132,3/19/2011,revtest1506,1,"Went to Sammy's on a Friday around 5 p.m. It wasn't too busy and was seated fairly quickly.  That's about it, no waiter ever came around to greet us, get our drinks or our order.  We waited about 15 minutes watching all the other tables get served except ours.  I will not ever come back to this place again! Poor Service.",negative
ts132,10/23/2011,revtest1507,2,"I really wanted to LOVE this place, but it just didn't cut the mustard, twice!



My first trip in memory was about a month ago to this location during late lunch.  The place was fairly empty, but the waitress was abrupt and seemed to be in a hurry.  I was in no hurry, as I was dining and catching up with a dear friend.  I felt rushed to order my food and didn't get a great look at the menu.



We started with the hummus, which was some of the best hummus I've ever had.  It was light though on the flat bread.  A clear uneven match of pita bread to the large hummus dish.  I would normally requested more, but I was too busy chit-chatting and had plenty of my main dish to eat, anyways.



I was torn between a salad and the pizza, and went with the pizza since the place is called wood fired pizza.  I went with the Tuscan and was warned by the waitress that it is topped with arugula.  I normally have no problems with arugula, so I was not deterred.  My friend got one of her known favorites, the chopped chicken salad.



Maybe I should have tried her salad instead of the pizza, since she raved about it and it looked delish.  My pizza came out and was a soggy mess.  The arugula was not chopped or cooked really and overtook the pizza.  Probably wouldn't have been so bad if the entire non-edge part of the pizza wasn't soggy.  It was also a semi-strange flavor.  I won't contribute the flavor to not liking that type of veggie pizza because it is the type I order at many other restaurants.  My husband also got the margarita pizza at another Sammy's a different day and it was also a soggy mess.



On another trip to another Sammy's I decided to try the salad, since my friend's was so wonderful the previous trip.  This time I went with the Balsamic Grilled Chicken salad, and I was, again, unimpressed.



I don't want to say I give up on Sammy's since the menu has soo many other great sounding dishes, but I have thus far been unimpressed.  On my list to try at Sammy's is the Greek salad, the Lobster Bisque, the chopped pepperoni salad, and maybe the grilled shrimp tacos.  I won't be in any hurry to try the pizzas again though.",negative
ts132,1/25/2012,revtest1508,2,"I've been to this Sammy's location a few times now, and every time it's the same mediocre experience.  It takes 10 minutes just to choose something from the monstrous menu, and by the end of the experience, only my hunger is satisfied. I don't know about you, but I usually go to a restaurant for more than just filling my gut.  Let me explain.



The Sammy's menu doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  Yes, their main draw is pizza, and they dedicate an entire page to this noble cause.  But then you flip the page, and they have a bunch of tapas dishes.  Okay... I don't get it, but I'll go along.  Then you flip the next page, and there's full-on entree dishes with no clear theme.  I know that variety is good, but I also expect some cohesion among your menu items.  For me, it just makes the decision process difficult.  Nothing stands out among the random dishes.



As for the execution of the food, I've never had a memorable experience here.  I was hungry when I came in, and now I'm not.  Hunger has been quelled, and that's about it.  I've tried the flatbread pizza (bbq chicken, maybe?) and oak roasted chicken with asparagus.  I've tried something else, but I don't remember (and I usually remember what I eat).

For the price it just wasn't that special. I thought my pizza was a bit too greasy. I know the pizza is wood fired but when the whole bottom is black there is a problem. The outer crust looked perfect the the bottom was just not the same. I had just 1 beverage the whole time and never got a refill. I felt the server was too overwhelmed to pay attention to our table. I brought it to the managers attention who simply replied back with ""we get busy and it just happens"". When it comes to pizza this place doesn't cut it for me.",negative

I should have stuck with the pizza or salad--what I had initially wanted until I saw a Tequila-Lime Chicken Fettucine. Always looking for inventive dishes, I made up my mind quickly and ordered that. When it arrived it had zero flavor and was sitting in a puddle of oil--usually meaning the sauce had separated because it was not fresh. I cannot stress enough how much this tasted like nothing: not tequila, not lime, not really even the oil it was bathing in. I was really disappointed.



My aunt ordered a Greek salad--slightly more flavorful, but really lacking the true ""Greek-ness"" I would like in a salad. The winner of the afternoon, and what I should have ordered, was the pizza that my cousin ordered. Just a plain cheese and pretty flavorful, though what is going on with the crust? I dunno, it seemed, again, lacking in flavor. 



Having never been to Sammy's and not really even knowing it existed until today, I am really not impressed. I found it truly gross and disappointing. I liked the decor--it was clean and didn't seem like it was in a strip mall. But I will not be back to this or any Sammy's.",negative

Upon being seated we were presented with our low-contrast menus. The low light--unnecessary for a pizza joint even if it's supposed to be ""fancy""--made them almost impossible to read. The options looked good enough: normal ""meat"" pies, pies with arugula and balsamic, bbq chicken... we got one of each. I got some pot stickers because I had a feeling that ""gourmet"" meant ""small"".



The potstickers were of the previously-frozen variety (I know, what should I expect from potstickers from a pizza joint) and were tasty, but nothing I couldn't have gotten from Trader Joe's. The pizzas were better than previously-frozen quality, but they were like that guy in the bar trying so hard to be cool but just looked like a dick. The crust was fine but did not have much of a ""wood fired"" flavor. The toppings were ok, but nothing really wowed us.



Our server tried to be friendly, but like everything else at this place seemed a bit awkward and out of place. The ambient noise--a feature of the tile floors and solid walls more than anything actually going on--made it difficult for us to hear each other, further frustrating the situation.

We had to ask for a bread basket, which the flat bread was burnt. I'm surprised it was served to us, I know the guy dishing it out could tell, not sure why he still put it on the plate. 



My salad came - appeared nice. Unfortunately the chicken was dry and there was no spice. The dressing is like a sour viniagrette, no kick there or really that much flavor.. then after digging into the salad, notice a lot of the lettuce had better days earlier that week.

ts136,2/8/2011,revtest1529,2,"Lets get the positives out of the way first. Okay now that we have covered that, lets move on to what is wrong with this place. 



Oh Yelpers you did me wrong on this one. Of course they might have been having an off day but I will never know. 



I want to be very clear that in no way did the black hair in my tzatziki sauce effect my rating of this restaurant, as a matter of fact it was the attitude of the employees about the hair that didn't do them any favors. I realize that humans (most) have hair and from time to time one wanders into food, and that is a part of life. Not worth getting hot and bothered about in my mind. But when I show it to you and you show it to the cook, then proceed to dish up another dish of it (all the while talking in your native tongue so I have no idea what you are saying) and simply hand it to me with a ""there you go."" ??? Really? No ""sorry about that"" even? No good kids. 



Okay there were some good things, the prepubescent version of the tzatziki sauce was one of the best I have ever had, and the rice was cooked to perfection. However comma what I was served was not what I had envisioned from past experience, what I was served was chicken soy sauce stir-fry with onions, A Greek salad that was reasonably fresh but soaked in vinegar dressing. 



And the final nail in the coffin were the mini wedges of dried out stale pita bread. What I am I supposed to do with this? How about a freshly warmed whole pita or flat bread so I can put the ingredients inside like a wrap? It was like trying to pile meat, rice, sauce and lettuce onto a really thick corn  chip. 



I recommend taking a pass on this place, or if you feel if you do, don't get the ""shawarma"" plate.

First off, the pizza is great. So is the staff.  However , don't expect to get ""all you can eat"" at this buffet.  



The lineup usually features a whopping 3 to 4 pizzas at a time on the buffet.  Each time I've been there, the pizzas are picked over.  When they finally put out a fresh pie on the line, watch out.  The lunch patrons attack it like sharks to a sinking cruise ship.  I'm serious.  I've had some burly dude shove me out of the way to get a fresh slice.  I can't blame them when fresh slices are rare at this buffet.  Top tip- Doughboy's needs to be more on the ball with the freshness and number of choices here. 



 Today's lunch buffet consisted of 2 slices of cold cheese, a fresh cheeseburger pizza (it seemed that nobody wanted) and some BBQ chicken pizza.  What about the usual standby's?  Pepperoni, supreme....????   



There is a salad bar, usually featuring brown, wilted lettuce and a small variety of not so fresh vegetables and 1.5 croutons.  if you get a bread stick, consider your self lucky.  Maybe a trip to DeJope is in order.



If you want good pizza, Doughboy's will fill the bill.  If you want to leave full, skip the lunch buffet and order a pie for yourself.  The all you can eat lunch buffet will set you back 9 bones, and you'll leave hungry and angry.  I'd go elsewhere for a buffet that has plenty of choices and a pile of food.",negative

Salad bar was iceberg lettuce with a selection of raw pizza toppings.",negative
ts139,6/25/2013,revtest1542,2,"A better local option than Pizza Hut to feed the kids, but not a culinary destination.



I struggled a little with the star rating.  I ended up giving it two stars since the ""Meh, I've experienced better"" is a closer representation of my opinion than the three star ""A-OK"".  If my kids were rating the pizza, it probably be closer to a 3 star rating.   I primarily use Doughboys as a cost-effective option to feed the kids on those nights where I don't have the time to prepare a home cooked meal.  



There are not multiple crust options to choose from when ordering.  On a 1 to 10 scale where 1 is crispy and 10 is bubble gum chewy, I'd give Doughboys a 6.  The crust does not detract from the pizza, but is nothing memorable either.



Doughboys does offer a number of sauce options (marinara, alfredo, olive oil, ranch and BBQ).  The marinara sauce tastes like you standard out of the can red sauce - OK for the kids, but not destination dining.



There are 22 different options for toppings.  The feta cheese option is appreciated and often utilized.  Topping quantities are adequate.  There are not any gourmet options for toppings, but the standards they offer are adequate for the kids.



The appetizer menu offers 16 options, primarily the deep fried options you would see at your local drinking estabishment (fries, cheese curds, onion rings, jalapeno poppers).  The breadsticks are popular with the kids and are reasonably priced.



I can not comment on the dinner menu (primarily chicken and fried shrimp options) since I have not ordered any of them.



Service for my takeout orders has always been prompt and friendly.  For carryout orders, the food is always ready on time.



In summary, I'm glad to have a locally owned pizza option to feed the kids.  It's kind of like the pizza version of McDonald's.  Not much in the way of creativity, but they offer a consistent product.  Until they step up their game, I'll continue to head into Madison (Greenbush Bar, Ian's) to get my pizza fix.",negative

Date of Dining:09 May 2011



We went here on Mothers day because my mother had been here before and wanted to come back. The location is a little odd as its located in a business park in a business building, but th parking lot was full, so it must be good right! I will review this using several categories (1) Menu/Food (2) Atmosphere (3) Service (4) Overall



(1) Menu/Food: This was mothers day, so the menu was different from their normal menu, but had a good variety including Veal, Chicken, Pork, Fish, Pasta. I ordered the Veal, which was good and my grand mother had the same thing, she liked it as well. My wife, brother and mother ordered the crab stuffed chicken. My wife said it was ""OK"" and was a little dry. We had a couple starters, the fried zucchini and mushroom caps. They were both very good. The prices were reasonable $15-$19 per dish, and the portions were good. 



(2) Atmosphere: From what I understand, this is a newer restaurant, but to be honest, it looked like something that hadn't been updated since 1979. The furniture looked user, the carpet was dirty and it just reminded me of places we went when I was a kid in the 1970-80's. Very dark. It has a nice location on the hill, they should work on their interior and get some modern furniture. Why do Italian restaurants in American feel like they need ""Old"" looking furniture. Every restaurant I have been to in Italy is modern and updated. 



(3) Service: This is where they fell down....Although out waitress was very pleasant and nice to us, she was SLOW....Not just SLOW, but brutally SLOW. I did not think they were super busy as there were empty tables, so they cannot use them being busy as to why they were slow. I guess they are not normally open on Sundays, so maybe they had a problem getting staff, but come on, its mothers day. 



(4) Overall: The food was average, the atmosphere sucked, and the service was slow, so I honestly would not recommend this place unless you are over 60 as it might be a place you would enjoy. They need to modernize their restaurant, clean the carpet, get some new furniture, and improve their service. The menu can be more traditional northern Italian (their menu had a lot of southern Italian influence to it).",negative

I am not sure why it has to be this way, but it is (this way). This place is as consistent as I am religious in keeping to ""clean"" language in reviews (which is to say not at fucking all). 



You get a public service discount one day, you don't the next. 

You get a drink with your combo (they are listed as coming with one, and certainly implied in the term), and you don't. 



I'm wondering if they are as A or B with their hand-washing back there. (Every one working with food should be A-type personalities when it comes to sanitation.)



One year they are two stars; incrementally they make a fan out of a skeptic; then, they manage to fuck it all up again. 



The breakfast burritos are the shittiest I have purchased at any other location on planet Earth. Pro Tip: Don't buy them. Just get a lunch/dinner burrito really fucking early. Your stomach will suffer one way or another at 4 a.m..

First off, the food. The food's not very good, to be honest. There's a lot of VERY pushy sales-people. (Lady, I don't want your goddamned Philly Cheesesteak for the 5th time... I GET sandwiches from a sub shop that specializes in them.) 



A lot of the food is left sitting in the sun for hours. This scares me from a health/safety standpoint. Most of the fare is carnival food, with a few exceptions. The pizza was very dry and unpleasant looking. The only positive point was my funnel cake that I had. 



--



Second - The booths. There's a LOT of garbage being peddled here. Also on the way in, they tried to loop us into a scam, saying we had won a free trip by giving us a swipe card etc. I swiped the card, and put in my first and last name, then it was saying ""I agree to allow X company (I think Wyndham) to contact me"" and then started asking for my phone number. I quickly canceled out and discarded the card, then took my friend away from the pushy salesperson telling her they were giving her a trip to Mexico or whatever at no obligation... (riiiiight, and I have a bridge in San Francisco to sell you)



--



Finally, the carnival. I'm sorry, but $1 per ticket, and like $3-6 dollars per person, per ride? Can I PLEASE have some of whatever drugs you're on, if you think that's an acceptable price? 



Also, please try putting in some fun carnival games. I don't feel like seeing 8... (yes EIGHT) booths of Balloon Pop... 2-3 shooting gallery games, and NO Skee-Ball. Ya wonder why no one's playing the games? Maybe because they've seen 7 other booths with them in less than a football field's distance? Just a thought.

Food is the primary focus obviously, and it's often overpriced, represented by many  local restaraunts, mostly Italian, but other cuisines  too. Depending on when you go, the quality of the food is very inconsistent. It's easy to get food that's cold, bland and overcooked simply because the vendors precook everything. 



They have a carnival/fair as well, to keep the children and younger kids entertained. 



They do have some free shows and live music as well.



Overall, if you've never been to one of these, you're not missing very much, but if you have absolutely nothing to do on one of the nights these are going on, go ahead and give it a try., just don't expect to have an amazing culinary experience.",negative
ts154,4/29/2010,revtest1594,1,"Went during the 09 Winter one. 



Honestly  I was all kinds of excited to go as food feasts are abundant in LA and love them. It was in such a small portion of the parking lot that there was too many people there..they over packed it to be comfortable for the space. It was a bitch fit to go through and since theres the entrance fee (was it like $10?) + all the hiked up food vendors it wasn't stacking to much value either. I was out  fighting for a place to even stand to eat so what I did was order, go in another long line and eat in line a few times as I had no other choice, but even then there were so many people bumping into me that I scratched myself with a fork on my face. We finally got a seat eventually, but it was by the stage and was very loud to be right by the speakers that we got up again to find someplace else. 



I didn't do carnival games which I LOVE to do honestly and am good at. I browsed and there was very few in variety and a bit pricey for games and rides. Also at that point, I was unsatisfied with food other than a funnel cake and a italian sausage sandwich which though good I don't think should be like $8-10 (I'm sure they have a bitch of a vendor rate though to pay off)....there was this rotisserie chicken plate that though the chicken was good and the macaroni decent,  the side of rice was spoilt. 



I was planning on going to AYCE or Korean BBQ that night. I should have for having spent about $60-$70 ish on both of us to sample foods. Totally worth it in LA where I enjoy myself, here I just felt sad as this is really it when it comes to festivals and this is overhyped. Sadly, it was once good and really fun. My BF told me of a time when he and his family have gone when he was a kid and had a great time. 



This year they moved to SIlverton Casino. I hope that makes a big difference. I don't think I will be back unless many people say its vastly improved.

ts154,5/10/2010,revtest1595,1,"Overwhelmingly disappointed. I had gone two years ago to the old location and had a pretty good time. Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Going again this time and going with my mom and girlfriend was a whole different story. Didn't help that it was extremely windy yesterday (not the feasts fault obviously). But at this ""new"" and supposedly better location they had parking across from the parking lot in a dirt field. Now I'm no rocket scientist but I knew it was going to be windy this weekend (little thing called weather.com) and having hundreds of people park in a dirt field with nobody out there directing traffic and a very uneven surface with lots of rocks and dirt was a disaster. **side note--- if you are driving a car in a wind storm, don't be a jerk and please let people walking have the right of way!!! You are safely in a car and we are trying to cross the street while getting dirt smacked in our face. Thank you** Dirt field parking - minus 2 stars off the bat. Another star lost for charging $8 a person to go to this. If the food was reasonably priced the charge to get in wouldn't be so bad. I feel sorry for the people who go to this event with kids. While the food was good and the service at the couple of tents I went to was friendly, paying that much for food I could have gone to a restaurant on the strip. $8 for a 6 inch sausage and peppers sub, $10 (are you f'n kidding me) for a 6 inch meatball sub, $8 for a 6 inch philly steak sandwich?! It's highway robbery. Minus another star for those prices.

All in all I probably spent close to $70 for not even an hours worth of time and barely any food. Not to mention we didn't go on any rides or play any games. Waste of time and money.

As a prideful Italian this was painful to write but someone has to speak the truth about this event. For a family of 3 or 4 with two kids this event must run $200.

Oh and the karaoke needs to be turned down a notch. I'm sorry but some of those kids were terrible and while its cute and funny I don't need a headache to go with my empty pockets.

ts154,9/19/2010,revtest1600,1,"OVERPRICED RIP OFF!



Went last night with friends. You have to pay $9 to get in. The food is good but rediculously overpriced. I had a smoothie it was $7 a plate of pasta was $14 and a cup of soda was $6. Very good italian food but the prices were unacceptable. You can't pay with credit cards, so you have to use their ATM machines that charge $5 per transaction.



The rides... you have to pay $5 per ride or $30 unlimited. What a rip off. With the wife and kids I spent over $300 in 4 hours.



The parking was a complete fiasco. The the line to get in... 1.5 hour wait in line. They were totally understaffed and the whole thing was not set up with any type of direction. There were so many people walking around you couldn't move. And like most carnivals in Las Vegas, 90% of the people were human scum. Multiple fights breaking out, gang members, etc. As I was waiting for the kids to get off a ride these black guys would walk up to me and ask if I wanted to buy cocaine at least one time every 5 minutes. After 11pm there were literally mobs of black kids straight outta the ghetto wearing gang colors and bling bling everywhere.



There were only 2 toilets, rent-a-johns, that were so filthy people were running out of them. No toilet paper, feces all over the floor, used tampons on the floor, and a stench that would make anyone puke.



If this event was run PROPERLY and prices weren't so high they'd get much better reviews. Management needs to get a grip.



Another tidbit...they need to keep the vendors Italian themed. There were vendors selling time share scams, air conditioning units, vacatins to Mexico, nudie bar tickets, etc. There were also multiple vendors selling the same product (who the hell needs 8 vendors selling plastic jewelry).



One positive thing, the VERY FEW actual italian people working the booths were very polite. They were elderly but they brought back memories of Little Italy in NYC.",negative

The food was way overpriced for what it was. If you have no means of getting out of the city, then this might be the place for you; I have experienced festivals waay better than this one. 



Even though parking is free and everyone wants a close parking spot (who doesn't?), you're better off parking in the Bass Pro Shop parking lot and walking either through the store or around the Bass Pro Shop and to the front of the Silverton. You'll save yourself a lot of time and hassle and the police directing traffic. If you take that main turn to the Silverton, you're going to be stuck for a while with everyone else going to the Festival. Keep going straight and around the corner and you'll see a place where you can turn left to the Bass Pro Shop parking area.

ts154,9/16/2011,revtest1603,2,"So this is a mixed review.  We had fun walking around although we got there early and by the time we left it was wall to wall people.  When you enter, you come up this row and the third booth in on the right is a Veterans Booth and they ask for a $1 donation for a bottle of water.  I will tell you, this is the cheapest bottle you will get there, because all the other places charge from $1.50 to $3.00.  The $3.00 one's are just plain scum bags and don't deserve to be there, selling the same bottle for $3.00 that you can get for $1.00 and it helps the Veterans (not a hard choice there).



Once you come up to the ""T"" you have 4 rows, 2 with food and 2 with crafts for sale.  On the left is a place called Lucy's and I had the WORST Philly Cheese Steak I have ever had.  I lived in Philly for 6 years and the dumpiest place in Philly still served a better cheese steak then these people.  It was very disappointing and NOT worth $10.00.



Across from them is a place called Anthony's and for less money, you will get the best cheese steak you can find next to POPS out on Decatur.  This was more like an authentic steak.



The food is ok, nothing to write home about and certainly not worth the price the venders charge.  You can get a much better Italian dish at Buen Guesto on Eastern and Horizon Ridge in the Albertson's Shopping center for a much cheaper price.  People were nice, but its like a traveling carnival with over priced food that does not taste as good as the signs say they are.  Will I go back, once a year if more then enough, however, next time I will probably go full so I don't have to spend a ridiculous amount of money for very very LOW quality food.  



On a good note, Carmines had pizza which was very good.  They are located on the right side of the food booths towards the back and they are worth the price.  A slice is a little more then in a regular place, but worth the price.

This year I enjoyed the location of the San Gennaro feast more than the previous year when it was hosted at the Silverton hotel & casino. 



We parked at the Gold Coast hotel & casino, had a few drinks then walked over to the festival. We went around 8pm after the sun went down and it cooled off a bit, it was still booming. I am glad we did not go to the Rio for parking, we could see what a bleeping nightmare that was with all of the cars and parking congestion. No thanks! 



We walked around to take a look at all of the food vendor options before deciding on what we would grub on. That took awhile as it was wall to wall people, just walking through to check out the food vendors was an obstacle. They created the isles too narrow and did not think of the crowd when setting it up. I don't enjoy buying an ice cold beer and having my freaking elbows knocked into spilling my beverage!!! No No No! I don't enjoy in the heat of the desert night walking grinding hips and rubbing backs with strangers. 



Ok...so after the complete challenge of getting your food, where to sit and eat you say? Not enough tables and chairs, we had to search as if on a scavenger hunt to find a spot to sit and eat our food that was growing cold by the second! Ugh...



Ok so on to what we ate...we had many rounds of cold beer from the beer tap truck. Mmmmm so refreshing and cold and I am not even much of a beer drinker. I had three beers just because they were so cold and went well with our grub and the heat. Yeah it was still HOT out at 10pm we were some sweaty mofo's!



We stopped by Taste of Chicago, mmmm yum and so glad we did! We ordered an Italian beef sandwich, paper-thin sliced beef marinated in A JUS served on Italian bread. That was tender and tasty, nice size with lots of meat! We also ordered a pizza puff, mmm yes yum you heard right! A pizza puff! A deep fried pizza pocket like pastry but delicious and loaded with yummy sausage, cheese, marinara, spices. That was a winner! I could have eaten many more of those! Mmmm yum yum yum yes yum I say. Ok so this vendor happens to be a local joint. They are located inside of Lucky's at 7345 S. Jones blvd, LV 89139.



Can't forget dessert! Classic funnel cake sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon did the trick. Was fried perfect, so tasty I was moaning at this point in our venture. It satisfied my need, my want, my craving for something sweet and delectable to embrace my accepting tongue. Mmm yes I needed you and you gave me what I wanted, thank you Mr. Funnel cake!



We happen to sit next to some really cool locals who we could shoot the shit with, was awesome we had a blast talking, laughing and joking it up. Exchanged phone numbers, yeah made another BFF also, yay! 



The music was awesome, enjoyed listening to the live musicians do there thing on stage making us groove!



Only 2 stars, the food is good but overpriced, yes we expect that unfortunately. The crowd control sucked balls and not the kind I usually like to suckle on. They just want our money, it is clear they do not consider the comfort or convenience of us the patrons. We are just a heard of cattle they need to milk and send on our way.

ts154,5/13/2012,revtest1607,1,"5 stars last year? What a difference a year makes! This year's experience, pardon my language, sucked donkey balls. Let's break down the formula for the San Gennaro Feast, circa 2012 edition. 



1: Parking. Fleece your customers to park sort of close or fleece them a little less and make them walk halfway across the west side of Vegas to get a parking space. 

1a: Find the surliest, most hateful parking attendants in Vegas. Hire them based on attitude. 

2: Find the most disorganized and slow way of getting people to the gate to pay admission. Did the ice sheet in Antarctica melt by the time it took us to get in? 

3: Once inside run past the pushy merchants trying to sell you everything. 

4: Pay out the nose for food. No let's take an arm and a leg too. 

5: Offer a super tiny itsy bitsy teeny weenie little place to sit and eat your overpriced food. (Think Strip prices but on the wrong side of I-15). Oh wait, we don't want you to sit, that would take up too much space we need for maximum monetization of the event!

6: Let's charge way too much for carnival ride tickets. 

7: Let your friends cut in front of everyone that waited 20 min for a ride. (Happened 4x)

8:Fight hordes of rude, stupid people who must have been born in a barn and don't have a freakin clue about basic courtesy.

9: Walk back to your car that was supposedly watched by ""security"" to find your mirror broken off and dangling and other damage done to your car. 



Las Vegas deserves a San Gennaro Feast that is in the Italian traditions, not the Mafia traditions. I felt like I got fleeced, mugged, and downright abused at this year's event. 



Someone needs to step back and rethink what the heck they're doing here. This could be a world class event but the way it's going, this will be the last year I go back.

I expected parking to be a nightmare, luckily we were able to get a spot in the parking garage of the Rio. In San Gennaro tradition, it was freaking hot outside!

 We had some street tacos (other than funnel cakes, the only food worth getting), yes Mexican at an Italian festival, it's the best and cheapest thing we've had there the last few years. We tried Anthonys World Famous Chicken Parm with spaghetti, it was the only place we could find that didn't deep fry chicken fingers, smother them with sauce and cheese and label it chicken parm. We'll we should've gotten the fingers, the chicken was dry, the coating fell off, the spaghetti was pre sauced...yuck, it was edible but... I'm not Italian and I could do way better Chicken parm. Shared an ear of corn (yum-more butter please!) and washed it down with sugary lemonade.

I really didn't feel like experimenting any more and wasting money on food I didn't like. Droves of people were beginning to crowd the small walkways, so we beat feet and split.",negative

My review is staying the same for the most part as my previous one for this event... overpriced, overpriced, overhyped.... yet, I still keep going. Go figure.



$10 for a crappy knock-off philly cheese steak!!! I wish I wrote down the name of the places I ate from so I would remember never to go to them again. I've eaten microwave cheese steak better than the one there.

$9 sausage and peppers - really good but c'mon... $9!!

ts154,6/14/2012,revtest1611,1,"My Italian family back in Pittsburgh would smack me upside the head if I were to bring them here and then call this an ""Italian Festival.""  Seriously, all I can hear in my head is my Uncle Vince saying, ""What the hell is the matter with you??!""  



When you walk in, you are greeted by Republican candidates, real estate agents, and several booths where you can ""Spin the Wheel! Everyone is a Winner!""  Once you get past the gauntlet, you find yourself amongst the food.



So we started to make a lap around the booths.  I was hoping to find some Italian restaurants from town I could try and maybe grab a slice of pizza.  Instead, I found nothing.  Either it was not vegetarian or had been sitting in the hot sun for far too long.  



Ummmmm now what?  We made another lap.  That's when I noticed that none of the booths had a business name on them.  They all just said ""Italian Sausage"" or ""Calamari"" or ""Pizza.""  So this is just a traveling festival and nothing they sell here is local?  LAME.



I finally found a local caterer and wound up getting a $5 Caprese salad that came in a Dixie cup with a slice of garlic bread.  I'm still starving!!  I then broke down and went to one of the generic booths selling pizza.  They wanted $7 for a slice that looked like it had been sitting out for the last two hours.  No thanks.  I got an ice cream cone and decided I had enough.  I'm out.



On the way out we walked past some circus side shows that involved snakes and monkeys.  I knew I would get too depressed looking at them so I kept walking by.  And then I proceeded to get super depressed watching the poor ponies being forced to walk in circles in the heat without any kids even riding them... or the sheep covered in wool that looked like they were going to pass out from the heat..... Then there went someone selling used hot tubs....and crappy jewelry....and ugly t-shirts....



Oh, and did I mention that they also sold Mexican, Greek, and Japanese food here?  There goes my Uncle Vince again....



So in short: I have been to Greek, Lebanese, Indonesian, and Hawaiian festivals in this town.  They all represent their cultures well and are made up of small businesses or churches.

A seafood vendor ""Lobster Muddah""(?) was actually very good. Depending on who you took a gamble on, the food was good or bad. Pizzas were doughy, some meatballs were loaded with bread crumbs. Prices for food were ridiculous. You would have thought you were in a proper restaurant. The covered seating area was adequate during the day but once it got busier in the evening you had to be aggressive to find a place to sit. Entertainment on Saturday was the highlight for us. The Las Vegas Bee Gees played at 5pm and were great. Unfortunately the organizers didn't have a schedule for entertainment at the venue or website, so you were on your own to figure it out. The carnival rides were your typical roadshow of rides and games. Once the sun started going down things got interesting. People were obviously dumping their kids without supervision at the event.

When we first moved here a few months ago, we were actually really looking forward to going to the ""Italian Fest"" (...yeah right) since my boyfriend is Italian. But after hearing and reading about all of the horror stories, scams, and terrible food, our enthusiasm died down immediately. Unfortunately, we didn't get to dodge the bullet this time since our friends wanted to meet there for dinner and I didn't have the heart to crush on their plans. 



The verdict? Let me tell you this, it's not worth it at all. At all! Everyone in our party had this look of complete disgust on their face by the end of the night. Talk about buyers remorse! Not only was this ""fake Italian food Fest"" a scam, so were the not-so-Italian vendors acting overly stereotypical ""Italian""

Here's how you quickly burn money:

- $18 for 2 adults to enter this hell-hole called San Gennaro Feast



- $8 for doughy-as-hell, stale, and nasty funnel cake from Funnel Cake Factory

- $12 (?!!) for ((3)) !!! offensively-salt-bombed jumbo cajun shrimp from T&T's Shrimp Basket

- $4 dried and overcooked BBQ corn from the Roasted Corn on the Cob stand. The corn was overcooked but it was pleasantly sweet. Just make sure to add all of those toppings and you're in business! 3/5



- $5 for a cold, bread-y, mushroom & olive calzone from JR's fine Italian Cuisine. The gal apologized to us that it was cold and took it back to reheat it. That didn't do much to make it better, but my Italian boyfriend ended up finding a glimmer of satisfaction in it. 3/5

Just for two people your looking at 50 bucks minimum between the $9 entrance fee each(ridiculous) and a small snack (not even the full meals). Also please stop with the animals it's borderline cruelty. Especially the part where kids ride the ponies.

There was one server, no maitre'd, and two bartenders.  We were told a 15-20 minute wait.  We sat at the bar.  Initial bar service was good and prompt, but the bartenders vanished, apparently to take up server slack.  40 minutes later we were finally served another beer, after numerous attempts to get the barkeep's attention.  At the same time, the group who arrived after us was seated first.  At this point we decided to just give up waiting on a table and eat at the bar.  As we attempted to try and catch the bartender's attention again, we watched as he forgot about a waffle and burned it to carbon, which made us dubious.  After another 15 minutes of the bartender vanishing (and presumably another burned waffle), we decided to give up.  Total wait, including initial sign-in, and then waiting for the check was over an hour.

ts156,2/4/2011,revtest1646,2,"Good, but too expensive....



Visited The Sharp Edge Bistro on a Thursday night. The place has a warm and inviting  bistro feel, although a bit sparse as you move away for the bar area. 



They have a great selections of beers in bottle and on tap.  Much to our dismay, the menu selection of beers wasn't what was available on tap - rather disappointing when you are trying to make a meal choice.



 Service on our night was terribly slow, there was plenty of staff  available who only seemed interested in socializing and milling about in a large brood at the back of the Bistro. At a place that specializes in beer, waiting 15 minutes for a drink is ridiculous. One of the many idle server could have easily said, ""Hey, would you like another?"" - but they didn't. Lame.



The ""Blue cheese flatiron steak frite"" was very good, and the ""Sharp Burger"" was as well. The desserts we sampled - a waffle with raspberry sauce and an the ""butter pecan napoleon"" were excellent..... 



But here's the rub - Value.



Shoddy service aside, $11 beers and $12 hamburgers are a joke.  I love Belgian ales and understand they are not cheap, BUT the food and drink are overpriced.  



2 Burgers/ 4 beers w/ 2 desserts are going to set you back close to $90.00 w/ tip!!  The food and drink are good, but at that price there are LOT's of other dinning options other than a burger and a beer.



Solid 3 star place with 2 star value.",negative
ts156,4/9/2011,revtest1647,1,"Been a while since we posted. Haven't been too many places recently.



I was headed to a local lunch spot downtown earlier than usual due to a 12:30 meeting (12:30? seriously?) and this was the first place we found that was serving lunch to the 1st lunch period crowd (remember those poor kids in elementary school that pulled the short straw and ate lunch at 11 AM - that was us that day).



Now I am not a drinker.  My dog imbibes more than I do, so the beer list was kind of lost on me (besides, I always think it is bad mojo to go into a meeting after lunch and wreak of anything, especially alcohol).



My CW and I were the first to be seated - maybe that was our mistake.  She ordered the quiche of the day and I ordered a sirloin burger w/ sweet potato fries.



Her salad was okay.  Nice greens although not much else going on in it.



From there, it went straight downhill.  When CW's quiche arrived, it was lovely to look at - leeks and andouille sausage - and cold.  Not warm, not cooler than you would prefer. It was flipping cold.  So she explained that to the waiter who took it back.  Then she waited and waited and waited.  Expecting it to be nuked, this was taking quite a while.



When he brought the plate out, it was a new piece of quiche - he explained that when they tried to heat up the original piece, it crumbled so they made a new quiche.  As a former waitstaff (waitress but trying to be PC here), I would have stayed around and made sure that this piece was more to her liking. But he bolted. And - you guessed - this piece was equally as bad.



Now I know - you are going to say she was picky.  But I actually touched the quiche to allay my fears and it was flipping cold.  My guess? The quiches were either chilled or frozen and they didn't know how to reheat them.  She ended up with a 1/2 of a chicken salad panini with dried cherries although I will be darned if there were any dried cherries in it.  So CW is going vote this bistro off the island.



My lunch?  I ordered the Brew-a-Burger Sirloin rare.  When it came, I don't think it was much warmer than CW's quiche - yes, I order it rare and expect the inside to be warm but I also expect the outside to be hot which it wasn't.  The cheese sat on the top and never softened, let alone melted.  I also expect a rare burger to be flavorful without the addition of much else - and it wasn't.  About 1/2 way through, I almost wondered if they had given me a ground chicken burger in error.  At that point, I figured it was not worth pursuing. 



Should they have given CW a free lunch?  Or a GC for a free lunch upon a return visit?  Doesn't matter what they should have done as they did nothing - the bill arrived and was paid as expected.



All in all, it was not a great food experience.  I don't think we will be returning for lunch anytime soon. Was it a bad day for the kitchen?  Did we arrive before they were really ready to serve lunch?  Not sure but, either way, when you spend $25 plus tip for lunch, I think there are better places to drop it.  Pity the kitchen staff cannot live up to the restaurant's name.",negative

The salad was really one of the sadder things we have ever seen. Lots of lettuce, little to no toppings, and the grilled portobello mushroom was small and shriveled, rather than plump and juicy.

Note: We did not have the food. This review is just about the bar/drinks.



The Sharp Edge is located in a pretty trendy area downtown Pittsburgh. The place itself is inviting from the outside, with large windows and a swanky enterior of leather and warm lights. Katie K., her sister, and I were lured in.



We opted to sit in a lounge area near the front windows. There were leather couches and chairs next to the bar. We were joined by an ineteresting crowd, ranging from college-aged kids to late-thirties who were trying too hard to make it a night out. Also, the leather couches were surprisingly uncomfortable.



The bartender was a younger guy with hipster written all over him, though I suppose that's the norm now for bartenders. I had lost my driver's license earlier that week but had other identification with me (including a scan of my birth certificate, don't ask), but he wouldn't serve me. Not a knock against the establishment, just a note to underagers that they card hard here.



We really came here because they have a pretty extensive list of Belgian beers on tap. The ladies ordered one each and enjoyed them both greatly. The issue: their cheapest beer available came in at $4 (a ""mystery beer""), while the average was around $7. I get that this is a downtown place, but when the bar literally next door serves them for half that you have a problem.

ts156,6/12/2013,revtest1653,2,"I moved away from Pittsburgh several years ago and when I visit there are certain places that I must eat or drink. Sharp Edge is a must. I love their Buffalo Blue bites and, of course, beer. I am an IPA kinda guy and was headed to a concert on North Shore tonight, so dinner at Sharp Edge on Penn Ave was a perfect idea. I hate to say that  I was wrong. Sure it was a little busy but I didn't have to wait at all. The host said they weren't sitting people outside because it was suppose to storm so I acquiesced to a booth inside. The guy who came up to serve me looked like the Pittsburgh Dad from that YouTube show. He asked if I wanted a drink and I said ""bring me the best IPA on draft""... he proceeded to open the menu, point at the Belgian draft menu, and told me everything was happy hour process so to ""pick one"". I was flabbergasted since 1) these are NOT IPAs and 2) waiters at Sharp Edge really should know beers. I responded ""these aren't IPAs at all, so I will need to figure this out by myself."" He said ""ok"" and walked away. I was shocked. At that point, I almost went to sit at the bar but there weren't lots of seats there.



I got up to check the menu on the wall. The Terrapin Hopzilla sounded good, so when he (finally) came back, I ordered one. I also got the buffalo blue bites, and he asked what sauce I wanted. Doesn't that come with buffalo blue sauce? Every other time I've ordered this for over a decade, every Sharp Edge person gave it to me the correct way without asking. 



A different guy brought me my drink. A third brought me my food, eventually. 



My guy came to give me my bill, eventually. By then, a skinny white man in a tie came by and I asked if he was the manager. He said ""something like that"". I told him I was disappointed that my waiter didn't even know the difference between Belgiums and IPAs. He just chuckled. I told him I was hoping my experience at the McMurray store (where we have a dinner party scheduled later this week) will be better. He said he'd trained there, but he did NOT address my concerns about my waiter at all. He pretty much ignored my concerns. I was unhappy with this experience.",negative

ts156,8/7/2013,revtest1655,2,"I'm debating between a one and a two star.



The food was...boring and poorly prepared. I ordered tomato soup and the ""gourmet grilled cheese,"" after being assured it was vegetarian. I received a panini-pressed cheese sandwich with bacon on it, and a lukewarm cup of soup that could have easily been from a can.



The sandwich was pathetic. The cheese wasn't melted (I could count the number of slices on the sandwich). The tomato was tasteless. The bacon (while I didn't eat it) looked soggy and/or rubbery. The bread looked (and tasted) like cheap store-bought sandwich bread. I'm not sure what made it gourmet. Even if everything was right, it was still just a tomato, bacon, cheese sandwich. That's hardly gourmet. Hook me up with some fancy aioli, or maybe some garlic jelly, or something unusual if you're going to call it gourmet.



Also, a grilled cheese sandwich is different from a panini sandwich. A good grilled cheese has that buttery, crispy exterior. This was just ... bread. That tasted slightly grilled.



I only decided on the grilled cheese and soup because the other vegetarian options were not enticing. I don't know why restaurants convince themselves that a portobella, a garden burger, and/or a vegetarian pizza are the be-all end-all of vegetarian cuisine. And after eating those same entrees for years on end, paying through the nose at a place like Sharp Edge for the same old crappy portobella cap just isn't something I want to do.



The only saving grace of the evening was the super-pleasant server. She apologized profusely at the mix-up with the sandwich, and was prompt and friendly throughout the evening.

Their tofu bites featured as a ""wing night"" companion deal are alright, but nothing special. The veggie burger is homemade, but infused with parmesan, so its not vegan-friendly. My vegetarian friend who ordered it said it was ""ok,"" but at 12 bucks is a bit steep for what you get.

Looked clean although there was some noise going on - an employee banging on something, have no idea what it was, a machine or icemaker or something.  Who knows?  Anyway, I chose the BBQ burger with bacon and cheese. Regular size. Also had a side of haystack onions. Order was done quickly and took it to go.  Okay, here's my opinion on this burger.  I liked the bun - a nice change from the typical fast food bun, so that was nice.  The bacon had a nice flavor, and I thought the burger itself was well balanced in terms of BBQ, cheese and onions (maybe a bit low on onions but not too bad).  Here's the bad part:  my burger was pink in places. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and definitely would have had it well done as I do NOT eat hamburger meat with ANY pink in it whatsoever.  (and yes, a burger can be cooked well done without drying out, if I can do it at home for myself, a professional cook ought to be able to).  So, I was unhappy and grossed out by the pink areas. Various people have said the food is greasy.  I didn't find that to be a problem.  In fact, I like a burger with a bit of grease sheen, so that was a plus for me. I did find the haystack onions to be on the salty side.  Not horribly so but a bit more saltiness than I would like (was rather thirsty after finishing the meal).  The meat itself in the burger didn't taste all that wonderful.  Just so so, a bit more quality than a typical fast food McD's type thing, but not soooo much that it knocked me out.  There were bites that just didn't taste that wonderful.  And every now and then the haystack onions had a bit ""off"" flavor also (like old oil).  Would I go here again?  Probably not.  If they lowered everything on the menu by a dollar, maybe.  I understand what they are aiming for, a somewhat higher quality burger than fast food, but until they can cook a burger without leaving pink in it, I would never eat here again.  It's a shame because they are on the right track somewhat, but like so many places, they aren't quite there, and in this economy, leaving with a bill of over $8.00 for one person, for two items, is probably not going to bring back a lot of people.  They seemed friendly from the way I was greeted, so no complaints there, but like I say, it was early in the day and no one else was there.  I'd like them to succeed but at lower prices and fully COOKING the meat, then they might get a loyal customer :)",negative

Unfortunately, that night gave an unrealistic expectation of what the chain really serves up- greasy burgers and old crunchy fries. The only thing that seemed to be as I remembered were the sweet potato fries. 



We ordered the large burgers, something I won't recommend as they come on the same size bun- the patty is the only thing that's larger which makes it flop over the side of the bun condiment-less. 



My burger was also served on a tray only half lined with paper, so I had straggling fries. The staff was kind enough the leave the expo ticket on my plate, too (yay fiber!). The tray liner was also soaked in grease, something that didn't happen on Yelp night- I double checked the photos.

Once we were seated, we were greeted by our waitress quickly. She was very nice, and definitely knew what she was doing. The positive for this visit stops there.



We both had quick 2 egg, with bacon, hash browns, and toast. Also a carafe of OJ. The OJ was great! Both our eggs came out way undercooked. The bacon was way, way, overcooked. ""Hashbrowns"" were raw. Our toast had some sort of nasty spray oil/butter on it that just ruined plain white toast. (didn't know you could do that)



Then while waiting to pay with our credit card on the table, we sat for almost 20 minutes before our waitress returned for the check. Again it was busy, she was double sat, no big deal. Except that the ""manager"" walked by our table 3 times and couldn't be bothered to pick up our check and run it.

At all. So finally my french toast arrives and I prepare to dig in. I read the top of the syrup closest to me which says ""old fashioned"" oh yea that's how I like it.

I asked for a manager. The woman who came over asked the problem, I told her and asked her to comp the pancakes. (They were part of the double blueberry pancake combo.)



She apologized several times then left the table.

Dudes!  When people bite into a menu item with the name jalapeno in it, they ought to know that is was a jalapeno that they just bit into!  I had two, and had no idea what I was eating!

Myself and two others came in about a month ago on a Monday night at 7pm. Walked in my first impression was this place is really pretty the white chairs are brave but very nice and then my second thought was we are pretty much the only people in here excluding the 3 women at the bar. Ok no big deal its Monday! why should this place be packed we sit and get a nice booth by the window and order a bottle of wine. Jennifer was our server and was really nice and did a great job!



We started our first course which was the Scotch Eggs and Crab dip...neither blew me away but if I had to choose I choose the Chips for the dip! They were great! Other than that the Crab dip was blah it needed something else to it and the Scotch Eggs were just not good they were overcooked and dry with no flavor...move on to the next



I had the French Onion soup along with my sister and my friend had the salad with Candied Walnuts....Soup was good perfect temp and not too big of a serving. Salad was served with 1 Walnut, she asked if she could have more, but really you only put 1 on the salad in the first place! I tried the candied walnuts and wish I hadn't they reminded me of Sour Patch Kids-Nut flavored they were gross, she liked them I did not!



Ok 3rd course I had the Surf and Turf- Short Ribs over Lobster Risotto- Sounds great right! It was but it was lukewarm and I wasn't really sure why but whatever I ate about half of it and boxed up the rest!



We then ordered the Ice cream of the day which is to be served with Chocolate covered Pretzels- Obviously our reason for ordering it! Well we get it and its just a scoop of ice cream so we ask for the pretzels and she comes back empty handed and tells us they didn't tell her but they don't have any.....Soooo mad at that chef!! 



2 bottles of wine and another round of wine later we ask for our check so Jennifer can go home since it was obvious that no one else was coming in! My sister had printed off a coupon for $50 off $100 worth of food well we definitely hit that! So we hand it to her and she comes back with it taken off and then we all just threw our card in and asked her to just to split it evenly on each card please...she comes back and tells us she can't do that because they're system wont let her do so...Wrong answer Ive worked, along with my friend on the same system they have (micros) that thing can do anything!!! That's why people buy them! Well then D-bag owner/Manager/ Bartender walk over and tells us he can't do it so we say that's not even possible for you to not be able to do it. He then says that it only allows one card to be swiped since he had discounted the bill already...Weird and stupid, oh and not TRUE!! It became apparent that he either didn't want us to use our coupon or he didn't want to pay the credit card companies for our 3 charges because other than those 2 reasons I'm not really sure what else his excuse was! In the end they figured something out and it worked out but my friend and I both explained to our server that there is a way of doing it and told her that if we were anybody else we would have just left her a shitty tip because of her bosses stupidity and that he completely ruined our night out by his arrogance...He should either go take the class on how to use his Micros like I had to in the past or go back to England!!",negative

It's over in the NC Music Factory, (which is a great spot if you haven't checked it out yet,) and sits in a cool space that has a very industrial feel to it, with brick walls and nice lighting. I had high hopes. But in all honesty, aside from the company we were with, it wasn't the greatest experience. 



*Disclaimer*: this review is based off of my experience dining with a 35-girl bachelorette party, which of course is going to be different than getting a table for two, for, or even six. For this reason, I will probably try it again. But if you are thinking about going with a large group, read on...



The PLUSes: 



*when we sat down we noticed that they had put together a menu specifically for our party, with the bachelorette's name on top. We all thought this was a nice personal touch (both on the bridesmaids side as well as the restaurant's.)



*we had our very own waiter dedicated to our party. Having waitressed for many years, I thought this was strange to only have one person taking care of a party of 35, but I thought hey, he must be THAT good.



*they put up with our crazy bachelorette games the bridesmaids had planned. (My apologies if you were part of the nice party of four behind us trying to enjoy a quiet ""couples night out"" - we really didn't mean to interrupt your dinner with flying ""Weener Cleaner Soaps"", and we hope we didn't accidentally sprinkle your salads with ""horny goat weed"". Yup, all grown up, I know.)



*they did not rush us in the least.



The MINUSes:



*the menu, although it was a nice thought, didn't go over too well. It took our food forever to come out (yes, even taking into consideration the large party), and some of the orders still came out wrong. 



*about 30 minutes after placing our drink orders, we looked over to see if our waiter was on his way back - turned out he was still taking drink orders on the other end of the table. Not. Good. Thank god the bridesmaids were prepared with those games.



*from start to finish, it took us a very long time to get our checks and get out of there to continue on with our night. We sat down at 8:30, and it was 11:30 by the time we were able to pay our bills and get to Butter. 



Overall, the food was okay - the caesar salad was pricey and a bit overrated, and the salmon was very salty and dry. But I do want to give this place another try with a table of two or four. I want to also add that they did make it right for us: after someone in our group spoke to the manager, they followed us over to Butter and got us all a table with free drinks. What more could a bachelorette party ask for? The timing even worked out for us, since we still had plenty of time to party, but just an FYI for large groups - be prepared to stay for a while.

#N/A,5/16/2011,revtest1711,2,"I was really hoping to love Bask - as I've been reading quite a few good reviews. See, it wasn't that Bask was horrible per se, but it was that it just failed to have any ""mmmm"" factor. Let me explain, ""mmmm"" factor is when something is so tasty you literally moan outloud in pleasure. Yes, I do this on occasion. 



We started with the scallop raviolis. They were um, small (3 half dollar sized pockets)...and FRIED. What the heck - we didn't want fried ""ravioli""- we wanted pasta. I felt that the menu should have distinguished this, as were really disappointed - this dish was simply NOT worth $10. Another person I was dining with had some crab dip that was well crabless tasting and dry - but we did like the homemade pita very much. 



For my meal I had a small plate recommendation and went with the spicy grilled shrimp. The shrimp were ok but a bit cool temp-wise. The fried green tomatoes were tasteless. 



Lastly I had the apple turnovers as I remember reading they were good. They must have ran out of caramel sauce as they used chocolate syrup - and the apples were non-existent. We were expecting big slices but instead got a babies-handful of chopped apple. 





My $12 citrus fizz drink wasn't anything special and was overly-limey. I wish I had listened to Nicole W. and skipped it! 



Overall it was just a let-down...and for two apps/ dessert plus one special drink and one beer (with a $25 groupon in there somewhere)   - my portion was just about $40 with tax.

OK this isn't going to be pretty. I'll start by stating I did have a restaurants.com coupon for $50 and had to spend $100, call me cheap, so what. Let's get to the facts most really good restaurants don't use coupons, there is a few exceptions to the rules every now and then. 



I'll start on the seating, we were seated at the table near the bathroom entrance. I requested to be moved to another of the many empty tables, of course they were not available They remained empty for the first hour, we had a 7:30 reservation. Seriously on a Saturday night? 



The waitress finally showed up to take our drink order after 10 minutes of waiting. The place was dead only about 5 tables in the whole place and at least 6 waitstaff wandering around. 



The order 

Appetizers 

1. SPICY GRILLED SHRIMP fried green tomatoes, sweet and spicy chili sauce...9 



Shrimp typical grilled shrimp, nothing special. Fried green tomatoes, someone please tell me why? Tasteless vegetable, covered in cornmeal with no seasoning.... 



2. DEEP SOUTH SAMOSAS crawfish, chipotle cream...8 



Must of ran out and went to the nearby China Wok and got some crab Rangoon, wait it would of been a larger portion. This was bad its basically fried won tons stuffed with about a half a teaspoon of cream cheese filling completely devoid of crawfish flavor. 



3. CRAB CAKE mango butter sauce, pineapple relish...12 



This was the best of the whole meal, basic simple recipe, however it came out room temperature, it was very bland but good crab flavor. 



Main Course 

4. FILET pan roasted Yukon potatoes, patty pan squash, Coca-Cola demi...27 



High hopes on this one, let me state this was cooked perfectly. I must of missed the Coca-Cola demi glaze. I actually thought it was covered in sweet teriyaki sauce, not a fan too sweet. 



5. SURF AND TURF lamb porterhouse, diver sea scallops, vanilla risotto, red wine reduction...29 



Lamb cooked well flavor once again fair. 

Scallops, 2 total about the size of a quarter and completely raw (see picture) We sent it back and it took 15 minutes to get them back and barely any better. 



SERVER TIP: 

If you see plates of food and nobodys eating, you should ask is every thing is OK 

Oh wait she didn't care see was getting 20% regardless of we enjoyed are meal. 



6. APPLE TURNOVERS roasted apple wrapped in phyllo, cinnamon and rum ice cream, chocolate, caramel sauce...6 



Go to Arbys you'll get better flavor crust filling etc....... 



7. ESPRESSO CRÈME BRULEE chocolate cigar...6 



Really? you didn't see the top was burnt when you torched the top too much! 



8. BLONDE BROWNIE Dirty Girl Scout ice cream...6 



Pass again 



Final 

The restaurant is beautiful and has lots of potential 



If you have an open kitchen your team should look professional, 2 guys had Chicago bulls hat and one a doo rag? Just didn't look professional.

We made a reservation for 10:15 a.m., and when we showed up, there were only two cars in the back parking lot, and the main(?) door was locked. Odd. We tried a second door, which was unlocked, and when we opened it, the alarm started going off. We saw inside just long enough to notice that the lights were off and no one was inside, but we hightailed it out of there before the cops showed up.",negative
#N/A,7/26/2012,revtest1717,1,"After reading through the menu posted on their website, we had high hopes for Bask. 



We went on a Friday night around 8pm. There were maybe 3 or 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant. 



Everything was going well until we were seated and started looking over the menu. Half the dishes were missing! Apparently they re-designed their menu and did not update the website.



Not that big deal, as there were a few other items on the menu we liked. WRONG!! We were immediately informed that they were sold out of the surf&turf. We ordered the trout and a sirloin sandwich, only to be informed several minutes later that they were out of the sirloin as well. 



We ended up with the vegetarian lasagna instead. 



When the appetizer was brought out they brought us the order for a different table first.



When the main dishes came we were very disappointed. Not only did the lasagna look like it was a giant blob of food covered in tomato sauce, it was also cold in the center. 



The trout was swimming in roughly 1/2 inch of grease and was extremely salty. The little fried slivers of sweet poatato used as a decorative topic were very good and had to have been my favorite part of my meal.



My girlfriend really liked the dressing on her salad. However, the salad consisted of a huge serving of greens with a few bits and pieces of other vegetables placed on top.



The bill we received the first time was not for our table. 



Did I mention that we were here for almost 2 hours? The service is extremely slow. 



There was no appology from the manager for any of the missing menu items, cold food, long wait, incorrect check, etc. 



It is a shame, as the decor is tasteful and modern and upscale.



Overall I would recommend that you RUN THE OTHER WAY!!! You will get better service at Waffle House and they tend to have the items listed on their menu.",negative

Even after we informed him, it took forever to get the food - and it was just sauteed mushrooms and spanish omelette. We didn't get out of dinner until after midnight - the entire restaurant was empty! No apologies or anything.

The main issue I have with Jaleo is the small portions. $7 for a plate of potato chips with red and white sauce drizzled, my coworkers make this at lunch in the lunch room, its called lays with sirracha and onion dip drizzle. We ordered to our hearts content but our stomachs were far from filled.



Don't get me wrong, I understand quality over quantity, but if you really break it down, give me an endless supply of the minuscule tapas, so small I can barely remember what I ate, I still wouldn't come here. The plates are small (yes for the 4th time in this review, not sure if I got my point across), but the quality of the tapas are not even that great or anything spectacular. The entire dinner, I couldn't stop thinking about the cup-o-noodle I purposely didn't eat because I didn't want to spoil my appetite, bad move. 



This place is not good for groups, seeing as you have to order at least 3-4 orders of each tapa to feed a table of 9-10. One star for the creative serving style, putting deep fried bacon covered dates in a shoe, fooseball tables doubling as a dining table, and decent service is about all there is to rave about here.

Great but... paella takes 45 mintues to cook (she let us know that when we sat down) and it arrived to our table 5 minutes later. Really??? I tried one bite and it was obvious that the paella had been sitting out for awhile under a heat lamp. Proably becuase antoher customer hed already refused it. The food was cold, the plate was cold, and the rice was well-done. I didn't dare try the rubbery lobster. The dishes we ordered afterwards were fine but nothing special.

They make the sangria to order so you get to see what's in it.  Cheap red wine, a little brandy, and a slice of orange.  $10?  Really.  This was unlike any sangria I've ever had.  Undrinkable



It was the service that really torpedoed our experience here, though.  It took us a half hour to get our first round of drinks.  We had to flag down the manager and have hime take our order.  Our server was a frazzled mess.  He was staring at the computer in the service station literally the whole night.



I got his attention at one point and asked if I could order a drink.  We were a group of 8 and no one had a drink yet.  I asked for a glass of tempranillo and he took off without taking anyone else's order.  Another member of our party managed to flag him down 10 minutes later and he tried to do the same thing!  Take one more person's order then fly away.  TAKE EVERYONE'S ORDER AT THE SAME TIME!  It was insane.  We spent well over a thousand dollars for 8 people.



I've eaten at Bazaar in LA, Jose Andres' other west coast foray into high-end tapas and it was one of the greatest meals I've ever experienced.  This place was a real let down.



There was so much that was wrong.  The fried dates in a shoe on the table.  Not cute or appetizing.  The sangria was absolutely awful.  Service was non-existent.  We wanted to order dessert but didn't have time since it took us so long to order and receive food and drink.  Paella inedible.  The room was way too bright.  I can't really even convey with words how sucky our meal was and how ripped-off we felt when we got the enormous bill.



The manager heard us grumping about the meal and didn't offer anything to try to turn the tide of negativity.  I think he was used to it.  Most other tables in our vicinity seemed disgruntled.

ts166,2/12/2011,revtest1724,2,"ATMOSPHERE // The environment itself is quite top notch, but that's more of a compliment to the hotel, not the restaurant. The slick idiosyncrasy of The Cosmopolitan continues through Jaleo. I loved all the design details from the typographic front gates to the piecework bull mounted on the wall and chicken tots served in a shoe (surprisingly cute and not gross idea). If you're lucky enough to have arrived with good company as I did, the restaurant's open layout and interesting tidbits allows for a good night of rousing conversation. My own party aside, I found the dining staff to be quite full of themselves, or rather, brainwashed by the supposed amazingness and sadly mislead by what a standard portion size is. I give them part of the blame for setting false customer expectations.



FOOD // The food really fell short of 3-stars. I've been to different small-plate kind of eateries before and Jaleo neither measured up for it's priciness in ingenuity nor taste. We took a while to figure out what to order because we were informed by our group of comrades who had a reservation before we did that the portions were fantastically small and the food not all that great. One friend honestly, and repeatedly, told us to get up and flee the place before it was too late. Could it really be that bad?

sangria :: This was a good choice. Served with fresh slice of citrus, chunk o' watermelon, and some mint. And one will need some amount of vino to make up for everything else. 

lobster paella :: We expressed concerns about hunger satisfaction so the waiter suggested the paella as a good way to fill up. The lobster paella had good flavors, but was rather salty (like most of the food). 

fried bacon wrapped dates :: Bacon wrapped anything is always good and ever better when it's deep fried. 

chicken fritters :: They're like tater-tot sized pot pies. 

garlic soup :: This was the worst. It tasted like you took the packet of Chicken Top Ramen seasoning and poured it into a cup of lukewarm water and then dropped an egg in there. The waitress gushed about how the egg is cooked at exactly 63 degrees and gave me a stony stare when she caught me rolling my eyes. I apologize that your soup sucked. 

chilled almond & garlic soup :: Interesting combination of flavors. Much better than the other soup, but that isn't saying much. 

kurobuta pork jowls & scallops :: I ordered this and it was microscopic for $14. A few slivers of unmemorable pork and maybe half a scallop total. I can get this for $6 at a Japanese izakaya. 

desserts :: We ordered 3 with components like olive oil ice cream, flan, and chocolate mousse. Again, nothing I think is worth mentioning. Do we sense a pattern?



All in all, the food didn't impress me in any way, especially factoring in the price and portion size. We had a party of 7 and with 2 carafes of sangria, 3 paellas, plus about 10 small plates, it ended up being $51/person. Jaleo is like dating a rich bitch: she may look nice and spout esteem, but it's all shallow and will set you back more money than it's worth.

ts166,2/16/2011,revtest1726,2,"I love tapas restaurants, so I was excited to try Jaleo in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  The atmosphere is much like the Cosmopolitan itself: trendy, popular, and loud.  



We had a group of five and ordered 3 plates each to share.  These were by far the smallest plates of tapas I've ever seen.  Some barely had enough to pass around once.  Plus, the tiny plates were way over-priced.  Some dishes were better than others, but really nothing was great.  We liked the ponche de cava, the croquetas, and the apple salad, but none of the entrees were good.  



The restaurant was loud and crowded and we kind of got lost in the shuffle a few times.  The service was very spotty - sometimes they took away our plates before we had finished, and sometimes they left us sitting for way too long before checking on us. The server said she would put all our tapas in an order that made courses, but that made it so some people didn't have anything they wanted to eat for a course or two.  Also, our check did not come until we asked the manager to track it down for us.   



In all, I would probably not return to Jaleo.  Part of the fun of tapas is enjoying the people you are with.  This restaurant makes it hard to enjoy the company of your dinner companions due to the crowded and loud environment.",negative

We understand that being in the cosmo it was busy but he did not once ask us how the food was, and was too busy with the couple next to us. He was too occupied with getting more money out of that couple than giving us decent service. Our food came out relatively fast but everything that came out was bland. By the end of our meal we were craving some flavor, hoping to get dessert.. It took us 20 minutes to get our check and not only that he didn't even offer us a dessert menu.



We had gotten the shrimp al ajillo, the chicken fritters, the chorizo wrapped in potato, and the tuna salad. All were bland and the portions were minuscule to almost non existent. I know tapas are meant to be small, but jaleo took it to the next level.



I was furious when I left, the food was sub-par and the service was ridiculous. I would have complained to the manager if I wasn't in such a hurry to get out of the godforsaken place. I will never go back to jaleo, I'd rather go to firelfy where the service is decent to amazing and the food is always out of this world.

Service was great EXCEPT from our main server.  She was a total biatch! She got annoyed when we didn't order a mass amount of alcohol. Sh!t, with the prices we had to pay in this restaurant, we couldn't afford alcohol.  She recommended the pork paella.  It was not very good at all!!! The pork was just spare-ribs with bones in it.  It was very difficult to eat because the meat was not tender so you had to rip it off the bones. The rice was uncooked!  We mentioned this to the waitress and she made some excuses and said that is how it is cooked.  Then she dismissed us by saying ""sorry"" very sarcastically.

Ambiance and service deserve 0 stars - overly loud dining room, unnecessarily lazy staff and servers.



For the details - 



Firstly, Jaleo messed up my reservation.  I originally had a res for a party of 6 people @ 6PM on Friday.  I called 3 days prior to change to 8 people @ 7 PM.  I didn't get a confirmation call the day-of which I thought was weird.  Sure enough, they never changed the original reservation and since we were ""an hour late"" when we arrived, they had already given up our table.  They did seat us immediately but had to squeeze us into a table meant for 6 right at the front of the restaurant by the bar and hotel escalators.  Yuck.  And, as noted by many here, the main dining room is certainly loud.



I also think it's ridiculous that they don't answer their phones before dining service begins.  Having to wait til 8PM on the east coast to call and make (and then change) reservations was ludicrous.  This is probably also why they don't call you to confirm.



So, we were seated and the waitress came around to take drink orders and informed us that, in her exact words, ""the kitchen is broken"" and they were doing all the cooking on the grills in the middle of the restaurant, so there were a few dishes that weren't available.  She didn't specifically mention which, of course.



We got our drinks and they were all amazing.  The famous G&T, sangria, some gold sparkly drink, a drink with instructions on how to drink it (dip this into this, then put this in your mouth, then sip this, then do a dance...)



Now, I'm a tapas whore, and the menu at Jaleo is very much standard classic tapas, nothing really out of the ordinary.  So I go to order 6 of the usual suspects for my wife and I.  They couldn't make a single one of them.  Well, what can you make then?  ""Well nothing from this side of the menu or that side of the menu.""  So...let me try again...what CAN you make?



Wound up figuring things out and placing our order, and the tapas started arriving shortly thereafter.  Except the runners kept coming to my side of the long table, saying to me what the dish was, and then putting it down in front of me.  So I had to turn into the waiter, loudly screaming across the table to see who ordered each dish and then passing it down.  I finally got fed up around the 8th plate or so and started forcing the runners to do their job and figure out who ordered each dish so they could place it in front of the right person.  For.every.single.dish.  Ugh.



Also, there were a few dishes we had ordered doubles of that we never received.  



Thank god the food was good.  We probably ordered every dish that was available and none disappointed.  Winner of the night in my book was the lamb ribs.  Fall-off-the-bone delicious.  Other mentionables - patatas bravas were potato chips which was a neat twist, and the romesco sauce had an interesting smokey flavor.  Otherwise, as I said, pretty standard stuff all executed well.",negative

What we got was so disappointing! To start off, the ambiance of this restaurant sucks. It's loud and the chairs are super uncomfortable. It's not a ""dressy"" place at all, it doesn't even feel like a ""nice"" place. The people sitting next to us looked like they had come right from the pool and overall the vibe was super casual.  Service was spotty at best, except that 3 times they tried to take away our dishes when there were still several bites left. Excuse me!



The food was fine. It wasn't bad. There was nothing amazing or creative about this food at all, just your standard Spanish Tapas.  The only thing that was unique was the fact that they served chicken fritters in an old shoe. When we asked the waitress about the significance of the shoe she just said ,"" I get asked that so much. The only thing we can think of is that Jose doesn't like plates"". It felt so gimmicky!  



For 2 people, I would order 5-8 Tapas to feel full. 





With the plethora of AMAZING other places to eat in Vegas and in the cosmopolitan hotel, Jaleo is not a place I would waste my time eating.





**EDIT** I asked Jose Andres on twitter why he served the chicken fritters in a shoe and he replied! Here is his reply:

Was told I could wait at the bar and buy the $18 Gin & Tonic (apparently the best in Vegas) and they'd call me shortly. about 1.5 hrs later, I finally was seated. yes. 1.5 hrs... and given the reservation was for 8:15 I was pretty disappointed. Even more disappointed by the fact that I watched a walk-in that had arrived AFTER my group and was seated before us (there were a few open tables we conveniently stood by that the walk-in's got). There's no question, the hostess just forgot about us. it wasn't until the bartender noticed our annoyance that he went and got us a table. Strike 1.



I love (and I mean LOVE) tapas. We ordered a bunch of traditional dishes, expecting them to be a little more traditional. The patatas bravas (that were around $14) was a bowl of potato chips w/ mayo & spicy tomato sauce on top of them. yes. POTATO CHIPS. This was highly disappointing. Strike 2.



Service was incredibly slow - we ran out of water and waiting over 30 minutes trying to get a refill. WOW. Strike 3.



Out of the dishes we ordered, I couldn't point to a single one that was better than the food at Julian Serrano (in Aria, just next door). And of all the dishes we ordered, all were more expensive than their counterparts at Julian Serrano. None of it tasted bad, I just can't justify the price for the taste.

Unfortunately, the pasta stuck the bottom of the pan and was virtually impossible to eat.  Overall, I found this dining experience to be a complete waste of time and money.  If anyone is interested in enjoying tapas during their next Las Vegas trip head over to Julian Serrano at Aria Resort and Casino.  The food is much better and dishes, bowls and utensils are all that you will find on your table.",negative

I've been to Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia, and one thing you cannot go wrong in Spain is Tapas. I've been to the Jamon joints and couldnt believe how good the food was...



So hearing this place had tapas and had a renowned chef...me and my gf decided to go to this place and test it out. It was free meal on a Cosmopolitan invite, so we said why not.



First to start the wine was great, and spanish wine always gets me in the food mood. Second we placed our order for several tapas.



While in Spain we loved the Patatas Bravas...and boy we were excited... Wuah Wuah Wuah... not only was it a liberal version of Patatas Bravas - it was salty...and it was pretty much like Potatoe Chips covered in Bravas sauce. MAN How the F can you get this wrong...its a standard in any Spanish Tapas joint...



Well to say the least it went downhill from there. I felt like each tapas I ate I was eating a salt cube. Yeah it was that bad, so bad that when we left Vegas I felt like I was on a salt binge. Whats worse is that the Jamon that we had was supposed to be good...man the cheaper ones in Spain blew this piece of ham out of the water. Yes we bought some from Corte Ingles in Barcelona and brought them home and they were better than this $17 plate.



Well to say it...we won't be going back....sorry it just failed miserably.",negative

Modern decor, sleek lines, and simplicity make up this restaurant's design. It's an open eating area where passers by get a full view of all restaurant patrons and their parties. 



If you could have just thrown in a screaming child at the table beside us, that would have completed the excessive noise level quota for the evening...Loud music, restaurant staff hustle and bustle, people talking over each other, it was impossible to hold a conversation even with the person sitting right next to you. 



Two people, fixed menu came to approximately $150. Doesn't sound bad for a ""Cosmopolitan"" dining establishment, right? Well, let me run down the ""list"" of items I consumed for my $75 worth of food:

A (as in, one) bite of beet *cringe* salad 

(2) potato and onion fried thingies (served in a shoe; weird) 

(3) bites of desert 

(3) glasses (small) of sangria

ts166,9/5/2011,revtest1748,2,"I'll start off with the good. The sangria is amazing and the food is delicious, the decor and ambiance really goes well together but that doesn't outweigh the things I was greatly displeased with. To start off with the restaurant doesn't even have it's name on the outside, how is it people are suppose to find the place if it isn't label? Is it suppose to be a secret that only a certain group of people know about? I only found it after walking around the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and using the process of elimination to figure out that particular restaurant must be Jaleo. Once we got our seats, I might was well be eating with the other patrons surrounding me, that's how close, cramp and loud it is!



Our waitress was very pleasant she took the time to explain the menu to us and handed us an iPad to order drinks. So what was the point of the iPad drink menu? Absolutely nothing! Basically it's a 300 dollar drink menu. You're suppose to scroll through the different cocktails, wines, beers...etc and you show your selections to your server which he/she writes down on a pad of paper. It's not like your sending your order electronically to the bar...because that would make too much sense. 



So after you waste your time trying to rationalize the use of the iPad drink menu it's time to order the food. Ironically this doesn't involve another iPad. So we ordered six things off the menu, 3 for the each of us.  Now I've been to other tapas restaurants before and when you order a couple of things off a menu the server does their best to try to get as many plates to you as possible so they can get you in and out. Well apparently that's not part of Jaleo's business model. Their model seems to work as let's wait 15 to 20 minutes before each plate comes out. Keep in mind that we had a show to attend across the street at Planet Hollywood at 9pm and I was required to pick up the tickets by 8pm, our reservation was at 6pm. So an hour and half goes by and still we didn't get our 6th plate, apparently the waitress or the kitchen staff totally forgot, so the restaurant manager reassured us that the dish would be out in a few moments. 10 minutes went by and still nothing, keep in mind it was a pasta dish...nothing super complicated! Eventually we got frustrated with the wait time and demanded the check, they of course they didn't charge us for the dish they couldn't get to us in time.  As I was signing my credit card receipt the manager came up to us again and reassured us better service if we were to come back, by that time I handed him my opinion on the ""How Are We Doing?"" suggestion pad. I pretty much wrote to him how lousy the food service was. Overall, stay away from this place. There are many tapas restaurants in Las Vegas, I still prefer Fire Fly.

We had a birthday to celebrate so it was the perfect reason to get dressed up and head to the Cosmo. The four of us were seated and I noticed immediately how loud it was, almost to where we couldn't have a conversation. There were lots of kids there as well so it isn't a place for a romantic date by any means. The wine list came on an IPAD which was cool until I saw that they only had Spanish wines by the glass. I had never heard of any of the them and had a hard time choosing. The waiter was friendly enough to suggest one based on what I like. When it came I did not like it at all. He brought me another to try and when I told him I thought it was corked he said it just had ""barnyard"" notes to it. Who the heck wants to drink a wine that smells like a barn? We ordered a meat sampler plates, some olives, ham croquettes, shrimp with lemon aioli and oilive salt. Everything was good, not amazing and the portions were so small even for tapas that we either each got one bite or had to cut something in half. We didn't even feel like we'd eaten anything after the first seven plates that I proceeded to quickly order 7 more. The mussels stood out but the paella was so bland and crunchy (underdone) that we had to send it back.

ts166,1/19/2012,revtest1757,2,"I've tried to go to Jaleo for dinner twice before, but neither happened.  I wish I hadn't pushed for a third try, because this meal sucked.  I would've given it one star, but one thing we had was really good, so it gets an extra star.  



My favorite foodie friend and I were both in Vegas on a Friday night, so decided to go to Jaleo.  He has been to the one in DC before and liked it, and I like Jose Andres food, so we were both excited.  



We were sat promptly, and the waitress came over a few minutes later.  She gave a whole canned speech about the menu (which is something I hate)...and gave us the iPad wine list.  There are some relatively good priced wines and of course lots of spanish options, so it started out good.  



She finally came and took our order, and we got a few things from each part of the menu, including the Paella Valenciana.  She told us they would group our items from the kitchen light to heavy and stage them to come out 1-2 at a time.  Great.



However, that wasn't the case.  We got three things within like 2 seconds of each other.  The first things were 1. Pan con tomate (Toasted slices of rustic bread brushed with fresh tomato). this was adequate.  not quite the traditional way, but tasty enough; 2. Some tiny green olives stuffed with anchovies and ""liquid black olives"". this dish was $14 for like 5 small green olives.  total rip off and i know anchovies are salty, as are olives, but this dish was too salty to eat...and yes, i've had them both together before and it doesn't need to be that overly salty; 3. tortilla de patata (Spanish omelet with potatoes and onions).  i'm about to get married, and this is one of the dishes on my menu, which means i've tried about 20 tortillas from caterers over the last few months, and this version was the worst i've ever had.  previously, i was shocked by how bad some of the caterers versions were of this dish, but this dish was twice as bad as the worst.  first of all, she asked us if we wanted it well done when we ordered it.  this is not a question that should be asked.  it's supposed to be a simple dish:  onions and potatoes sauteed til tender, add egg, let form til set completely.  that is it.  we got it and it was wet, and runny, so not even well done like she asked if we wanted it.  it was also super thin, with only like one layer of potato.  it was so gross we didn't finish it.  



So then we flagged her down and said we wanted to slow it down a bit, since everything so far had been rushed to our table. This was a mistake, because from then on it was supperr long wait for everything.  She told us then that our paella was ready, and we said oh no thanks - we want to wait until the end for that dish, since it's most like a ""main course"".  This is after she told us the kitchen would structure it light to heavy for us, so delivering paella with the first few things made no sense.



The next dish was Ensalada rusa (a salad of potatoes, imported conserved tuna and mayonnaise).  This was ""okay"", but not great.  It was much better than it looked - It was covered with foam.  It looked like my cat threw up on it.  I'm not a foam fan.  But the potatoes were cooked well, and the tuna was tasty.



The next dish was the Seared scallops with romesco sauce.  The dish arrived and was pretty enough to look at.. However,  both our scallops had grit.  This, is not good.  Neither of us finished our scallop (the dish had two) and we called the waitress over to tell her they were gritty.  She apologized, but didn't seem to really know what that meant. 



Then we got the last dish before our paella...the veal cheeks with whipped olive oil potatoes.  This is the only reason the restaurant got 2 stars.   This dish was really good.  Looked good.  Tasted great.  Very tender veal cheeks.  The potatoes were fluffy bites of heaven.  Very very good.  This is what I expected every dish to be like, but sadly, it was the only good dish.



So now we are excited to try the paella.  i guess i was still holding out hope it would save the meal?  but the waitress comes over and tells us that they're out of the paella.  What?  We ordered it an hour ago.  They had it.  You tried to serve it to us at the start of the meal, we said we'd wait...and now you're out of it??  She offered us a different paella, at double the cost of the one we ordered.  We said, no thanks.  And were super unhappy about it.  We were both still hungry, but didn't want to try anymore crappy food, so asked for the bill.



We got the bill, and the damn scallops were still on it.  We called the manager over to complain (we've both been in the biz for years, and if someone complains about a legitimate quality issue, that should NEVER be on the check).  So we explained that they were gritty and shouldn't be on the check.  He apologized and claimed it was an oversight and took it off the bill.

Having been to many places on the list, Jaleo was the first reservation we made for this trip. 



Jaleo is served tapas style and has many modern takes on old classics some were exceptional (the chicken wing special with sherry reduction and a blue cheese)  others fell a little flat to me (patatas bravas) and others way over salted (lobster paella). The best part of Jaleo was the table seated next to us. Terance and Alfonso, two brothers from California. We shared some food with them so we were all able to try some bites of food we otherwise wouldn't have ordered.  Boys, don't forget to get in touch when you come to NYC!

I was expecting to get a trendy atmosphere, great food and good drinks. We did not get that. 



We arrived about 5 minutes before our reservation. We waited for about 15 minutes and then were seated. We were seated in the booths that were open to the hotel. They were WAY too close together. We may as well been dining to the people next to us because we could hear everything they said. We ended up talking to the couple next to us and they were very nice but still, not what I was looking for. There were also a table of people sitting at at table right outside the restaurant. They had their children playing on the foozball table and they were screaming and making noise and basically ruining our dinner. Not that it was quiet to begin with. The music was way too loud. 



So a HUGE thumbs down for the atmosphere. I guess I am just too old for trendy. 



We ordered the tomato bread, the cod empanadas, the manchengo queso, and the boneless chicken wings. Our waitress said that there was a chicken special that was so much better than the chicken wings so she would bring that instead. I did not object but I should have. 



The tomato bread was yummy. $6 bucks.



The manchengo queso was an actual small slice of cheese with some dried fruit. I was thinking I was going to get some sort of yummy dip. Nope, a small piece of hard cheese. Wow Chef! Did they teach you that in culinary school?  I suppose queso does mean cheese in Spanish so it is my fault for assuming. $9 bucks



The cod empanadas were more like wontons to me. They were fried with pureed cod inside and honey drizzled on the outside. The taste was decent but the texture made me want to gag a little bit. 



The boneless chicken wings. These chicken wings cost $18 dollars for 4 of them. While I was eating them, I was thinking..""These are not any better than Buffalo Wild Wings."" NOT IMPRESSED. If those were sooo much better than the other ones, I would have hated to taste those. 



My husband ordered a glass of scotch and I ordered a bramble (house specialty drink). They were $12 bucks a piece.



Our bill came to about $90 dollars because after those food fails and the noise, we decided to leave and go somewhere else. We were still starving. The plates are ridiculously small for what they charge. And here's the thing. THEY AREN'T THAT GOOD. I don't get it.

We ordered the Patatas bravas, whose name and description was exactly the same as our favorite dish in DC. To our horror, instead of deliciously pan fried fingerling potatoes topped with a yummy garlic aioli and a spicy tomato sauce that we get at the DC Jaleo, out came a bowl of potato chips with a garlic aioli and a tomato sauce squirted on top of them.

We asked to switch tables after being seated directly behind a noisy server station. We asked the server if we could keep him and he said the new table would be ""a little too far"" what?? seriously?



We hadn't even ordered any food at this point, and then our new server came over, and with no introduction, or ""sorry the other table was noisy, is this table better? she simply just said ""do you want to add anything?"" She seemed like more of an order taker than a server, with other tables around us too.



Overall, the servers seemed to be more into socializing with eachother, even the managers. We had a female manager circle around our table twice, and she asked a table of two older genteman twice how everything was, but never stopped by us once, or any other tables in the area, that we noticed. 



We felt like we were more at the Plant Hollywoood of Tapas....servers who seem to be interested more in eachother, or being somewhere else completely, and an air that we are just ""tourists"".  And food that is put together for the masses..

I mean we're talking 2 bites at most if you are sharing (which I was) with somebody else! The Pan con tomate was pretty much the only 4 bites I had in succession on one plate. Think mini food.



That being said the flavors were spot on and even exceptional when it came to carne asada, the roasted peppers were a great compliment to the slightly spicy beef! My biggest disappointment was with the 'lobster', aka langoustine, which I felt a little lead astray on by our server's description. When asked how large the tail was, she gestured a hand width of about 6 inches. To me, this justified the ~$16 price tag (I can't remember exactly how much it was but it was on the higher end). When it came out, the lavender scented foam was slight, not overpowering, but the meat in the tail was less than that of a large shrimp you find in a neighborhood grocery store. I felt so bad after one nibble, I gave the rest to my boyfriend to try and make up for the fact that I bombed on this suggestion. Other than that, the tempura shrimp were done well with a very nice dipping sauce, and the special (gourmet grilled cheese) was to die for. I mean--how can you go wrong with grilled cheese?



Overall I felt our $120 bill was a little overpriced for the emptiness I still had lingering in my stomach.

first off...its expensive...TOO expensive if you ask me...



i understand that spanish tapas and ""tapas"" in general are small plates with smaller portions BUT cmon man...how are you going to charge what you charge for this food?  



so here is what i ordered...



mini burgers with peppers and alioli...these 3 sliders tasted like sliders. normal sliders...it supposed to be made from special spanish pigs, but they tasted like normal state side pigs to me.



pressed ham sando with manchego cheese and truffles...i really cant say anything negative about this sandwich...i loved it...like to the point where i could just order 3 or 4 orders and just eat them one by one...very truffley, very buttery, salty from the ham, and very cheesy...great sandwich indeed.



spanish omelet with potatoes and onions...i make this at home all the time. its just an omelet with runny egg and 5 slices of thin potato slices in there...wth?  so boring.



homemade pork sausage stew with pearl onions and mushrooms...i really wanted to like this dish, but for as much flavor that there was here...it was overpoweringly salty...like to the point where i wanted to gag salty...



seared scallops with romesco sauce...these scallops were cooked well...they give you 2 scallops for 15 bucks...at Yardhouse you order extra scallops with their tomato cream sauce and its 20 bucks for 8 scallops the same size and taste similar...



grilled skirt steak with pepper confit...overcooked. and chewy. not great in any way.



im reading that the service there is phenomenal...our servers werent. they werent bad in any way, but i mean cmon....thats your job...so just do it...

ts166,7/9/2012,revtest1774,2,"This was my second time here, and quite possibly my last. I'm a fan of Jose Andres' restaurants, but the food tends to be a little hit-or-miss. I really like Bazaar out in LA, but the hit-to-miss ratio was considerably less favorable at Jaleo. Nothing overwhelmingly great, but the lobster salad was good, as were the gambas con gabardina, and the endive with goat cheese. The pan con tomate with anchovies and the the bacon-wrapped dates were both ok, although nothing spectacular. And we should have stayed away from the patatas bravas, which for some strange reason consisted of a bowl lays potato chips squirted with sirracha and mayonnaise. 

The real killer for the evening was the service. I realize dumb people have to work someplace, but do they all have to be assigned to my table? The bus boy kept awkwardly climbing over us or shoving himself between us trying to take our dishes and glasses when we clearly still had food and pitchers of sangria in front of us. At one point he practically tried to take the fork out of my date's mouth mid-bite. An I once had to slap at his hand to keep him from taking my plate. He's very lucky he didn't catch a fork to the hand. The waiter was really no better, and screwed up our order at least 5 times. It's 3 days later and I'm still waiting for my gazpacho. I also recommend checking your bill before putting your credit card down, as our waiter screwed that up, too.",negative
ts166,7/13/2012,revtest1775,2,"I came here with a group of friends for my birthday dinner. We had the 13 course tasting menu. 



Some initial downsides were: very crowded and has an ""energetic"" environment. It's difficult to get them to agree to a large dinner, and when they do, you have to do a tasting course. When you do the tasting course you have to sign a contract. If you sign the contract you guarantee the # of folks in your party.



In our case, half the table decided they didn't want to eat and so they walked out. This left me arguing with the F&B manager for the night, who produced a copy of the contract - that was oddly missing the page where I wrote that the size of the party could change (and signed off on by the F&B manager for the restaurant)



I seriously argued with this person for over 20 minutes going back and forth as to the best course of action, while all my guests sat waiting. On my birthday dinner. 



Eventually we reached a draw and decided to just eat. So the food started coming and it was actually AMAZING! It has been a minute so I forget ALL the courses but here are the ones I remember:



- the bruschetta w/ tomato - amazing. I still think about it. 

- dates w/ bacon 

- the paella of course



Unfortunately there were more issues...after the first 4-5 courses came out, we sat for 30 minutes without a single additional course coming. This was actually a good thing (wait and see). After pointing out to the waiter that no food was coming to our table, he went back to the kitchen and did something because orders started coming out, but not in the order on the menu. My guess would be that the kitchen fell behind on our table, got yelled at, and fired whatever they could get immediately. So props to them for getting things moving.



Dessert was delicious. The wine list was amazing. 



And, our F&B minimum was eventually adjusted due to the failure at the table. 



Following are my recommendations for this spot:



- it's too high volume for a large group. Come in smaller groups (less than 10) and order off the menu instead of getting a tasting menu.



- don't sign a contract because if things don't go your way, they'll be inflexible and refuse to work with you, even a little bit.



- if you do sign a contract then get the private room at least. 



I'm giving this spot 5 stars for the food and taking 3 stars away for the awful customer service.",negative
ts166,8/9/2012,revtest1776,2,"Arrived on a Wednesday to a packed house at Jaleo. We were seated within 10 minutes of our arrival. We were then given an IPad to review the drink list. We didn't see our waiter again for 15 minutes. Note, you can not order your drinks from the IPad. Our waiter finally appears and takes our drink order. Literally another 15 minutes goes by before we got our drinks. I watched tables that were seated after us get their water, drinks and first courses by the time we got our drinks. Ordered the ""infamous"" gin and tonic and my friend got a specialty whiskey drink. The gin and tonic is just that. A gin and tonic, not sure what all the hype is about. The whiskey drink was far superior. We ordered the following dishes for our meal. 



Chorizo w/fried potato - I personally liked the dish because I'm a sucker for chorizo but no one else cared for it. 

warm spinach and pine nut salad - boring and tasteless

Seared Scallop - Overcooked 

Grilled skirt steak - Ice cold by the time we received it but had decent flavor

Apple and fennel salad - Probably the best dish of the meal but it's a salad!

Chicken fritters - Fried with mushy chicken in the center 

Shrimp skewers - Greasy 

potato and onion fritatta - We did not order this dish but it came to our table anyway and we ate it because we were so hungry. Decent, but I could make it at home. 

gin and tonic oysters - Did not eat any, but I hear they were pretty good. 



Overall the service here is really lacking, we were all done with our drinks half way through the meal, were never asked if we wanted another. The food is mediocre and not worth the price. We all left hungry and disappointed. 



Way overrated.",negative
ts166,9/4/2012,revtest1777,2,"If your server's name is Mario, run for the hills.



I consider myself to be somewhat of a José Andrés fangirl so I was naturally looking forward to dining at Jaleo.  Needless to say, my expectations were not met.  The food itself was decent.  Not quite as inventive as The Bazaar's offerings but with the lower price point, that's to be somewhat expected.  Service, however, was horrifically below a restaurant of Jaleo's caliber.



When my party was seated, the waiter proceeded to give us the ""key dishes you should try"" shtick including the many varieties of paella that the establishment is famous for.  Okay sold.  We try to order the paella only to be told that we can't do so because we have a party of four and the menu states that you must have a party of six or more.  Uh, okay.  Then why did you just spend all that time raving about your paella?  We then ask if it would be at all possible to check if there were any other tables ordering any of the paellas that we could combine ordering forces with because we really wanted to try the paella.  Our waiter flat out rejects us without even bothering to check.  Now I understand that there's a certain protocol to be followed and I wasn't necessarily expecting an exception but would it have been so hard to double-check (pretending to check would have been more than sufficient)?  Oh and here's the delightfully irking kicker: OUR SERVER WAS WRONG.  While dining at é by josé andrés this past weekend, the infinitely more gracious and knowledgeable waitstaff notified me that every night, Jaleo makes a paella of the day for the entire restaurant to order individual portions from; the six or more limit only applies to parties who want to order a paella of their choice.  A waiter who's clueless about the menu at an upscale(ish) restaurant?  For shame.



Following the paella debacle, I excused myself from the table so I could surreptitiously notify our waiter that one of the girls in my party was celebrating a birthday and that I'd like to surprise her with a dessert.  I couldn't find the waiter so I told the busboy who had been helping our table who in turn said he would pass along the message to our waiter.  While giving us our dessert menus, our waiter proceeds to ruin the surprise by saying, ""and are we celebrating a birthday today?""  I wouldn't expect this kind of a misstep from a T.G.I.

Our group was 7 girls and none of us were particularly hungry.  We ordered 8-10 tapas plates.  Each one that came out lacked in presentation (the chorizo looked like sausage I could have bought at the grocery store, cut up, put on a place and set out at home), was very small (and that's coming from someone who lived in NY for years), and really, nothing we had was exceptional.  The food was alright, nothing to write home about or bother going back for and I didn't like the sangria at all. 



They also didn't have the lobster paella, which we knew we wanted to order.  They didn't have any of the paella, but said if we wanted one we could order an entire pan, which was 6 servings ($30-56 a serving).

ts166,12/3/2012,revtest1780,1,"COMPLETE DISSAPOINTMENT...RUINED MY BIRTHDAY!



I was in Las Vegas celebrating a significant birthday and was looking for a special place to have dinner. Upon reading the multiple positive reviews of this restaurant, I was completely fooled into trying it out. Had I known the quality of the food would be inferior, the customer service would be extremely poor and that I would have to fight with the manager to get a burnt paella dish off of my bill, I would have NEVER EVER visited this restaurant. I wish that I could have gone with my 2nd dining choice of TAO or for that sake, anything else would have been better than dining at Jaleo since I was very dissatisfied and they totally ruined my birthday dinner.



The night was off to a good start with our drinks. We ordered a variety of tapas including Gambas al ajillo, patatas bravas and croquetas de pollo. Though the portions were extremely small for the price of each dish, they were savory and had good flavor. My expectations were high for the grilled skirt steak (carne asada con piquillos) and the black noodle paella with shrimp (Fideua Negra on Calarmares y Gambas). I was hoping these dishes would be heartier because despite having enjoyed the other dishes I was still feeling very hungry. I was disappointed when I saw the small size of the steak that was cut into 4-5 small pieces) and at this time I started to get upset with the small portions and the price for each (just the small steak was $16). I was even more disappointed with the paella because again, not only was the portion small (and $25), the shrimp turned out to be bite sized pieces (like they'd taken a regular size shrimp and cut it into 4 smaller pieces), but the dish was also burnt! We discovered the dish was burned at the bottom because we were all so hungry from not getting our fill from the small portions of the dished we'd already eaten and were digging into the paella trying to eat as much of it as possible. We were only able to eat about half of it because the remainder of the dish was a crusty, burnt mess that was stuck to the bottom of the pan (similar to what would happen when you make rice at home and you don't add enough water and it sticks). When we brought the issue up to the waiter he said ""I do apologize, but we have some new apprentice people in the kitchen"" and asked if we wanted a new dish. We said no because it would take about a half hour to make and by this time, it was close to 11:30 pm. Plus, I was already extremely disappointed with the food and wanted to leave. I told the waiter we were upset by the quality of the food and a few minutes later a manger came to our table to ask if everything was OK. I told her (I believe her name was Andrea) that I was surprised and disappointed that a restaurant of this caliber would be serving food that was burned and of inferior quality. Rather than accepting fault for the obviously burned paella which was at the table, she chastised us and said we should have brought the issue up sooner and that we had probably enjoyed it because we got to the bottom of the pan and that's where the burnt part was. I couldn't believe she was actually making us feel guilty for eating the dish and not bringing it up sooner. She tried to make up for it by bringing me a dessert, however I was celebrating my birthday and in most restaurants, a dessert is complimentary, so I was still not satisfied. 

When our bill came I was furious to see that they were still charging us the $25 for the burned paella. I brought it up to the waiter and he was flustered and didn't know what to do. Again, Andrea came to the table and said she thought they had made good on the burned dish by bringing out the dessert. I told her that I would absolutely NOT pay for the dish that was burned and that I was extremely upset for having dined at this restaurant which I thought would be of much higher quality given its inside one of Vegas's new hotels. After practically having to fight to have them take the dish off of my bill, they did indeed remove the charge, but I was already very upset and felt we had not been given the good quality service we deserved, especially for celebrating my birthday.

Bottom line, I will NEVER EVER return to this place or recommend it to others. Prices are high, portions are very small, customer service was bad and they completely ruined my birthday dinner!",negative

Now food... The only things we thought were really good were the veal checks.. Very tender and soft.. And also the cannelloni noodle with the pork filing.. Very rich but good.  



The tomato bread seemed soggy.. The croquettes (while served in a playful shoe) were only ok... The bacalao empanadas were like fried greasy wontons.  The asparagus was tender but only tasty if u dipped it in the sauce it came with which wasn't enough Togo around. We had a sample of the lobster paella ... The rice was dry and tasteless, lobster was overdone... So glad we didn't order it.



Now service...there was some major disconnect between the server and other servers as well as with us.. Moreso than I have ever seen before at a restaurant.

Our first round of ordering I ordered a dish that never came.. So when we asked about he he was like ""oh, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to put it in""... Then when we said ""yeah.. We do""..  He was like ""oh actually, well the chef wasn't happy with this dish tonight so we suggest you try another dish similar to that"".... Ok.... But it was weird he never told us this.



Next time he said ""we have lobster paella now but later they are making shortrib paella"". We said we would like the short rib paella when it comes out..and then ordered some other dishes. Meanwhile a waitress comes by 15 min later with a plate and says ""the waiter said you were interested in the paella so here is a sample of the lobster paella"". We tasted it and thought ""meh, glad we ordered the shortrib cuz this isn't that good"". Meanwhile other small plates come out and we said ""oh is the short rib paella coming still?"". Then he was like all ""oh I wasn't sure if you wanted it"" and we were like yeah we ordered the shortrib... He's like ""oh but didn't the waitress give you a sample,"". We were very confused.. He said ""oh the chefs decided to go with lobster all night and not do the short rib""...  Ok.... Why didn't you tell us this when we clearly ordered it?? 



So much confusion... So awkward... And so overpriced. The dishes were not that well executed and staff seemed not well-meshed.

Canelones Tradicionales De Cerdo Y Hígado De Pato Con Salsa Bechamel (pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce) - this looked like two enchiladas when they came out covered in cheese. It didn't taste anything special and the meat just tasted like random meat with no foie gras in it. Boring dish in terms of flavor



Setas Al Ajillo Con La Serena (sautéed wild mushrooms with la serena potato purée) - This could have been a MUCH better dish if it wasn't over seasoned. Way too salty.

We ordered a variety of items to share between a group of 6 people.  This included Vieiras Con Salsa De Romesco (scallops), pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce, grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit.  



The scallops were 2 tiny little scallops that were presented in such a dismal way that would never have made it past Gordon Ramsay in the show ""Hell's Kitchen"" (you know, where the scallop station is the death of every contestant!).  They were tiny and drowing in this orange sauce.  



The pork and foie gras canelones were probably the best out of all the things we ordered.  No one could detect the foie gras though.  They looked and tasted like little enchiladas so if there was foie gras, it was minced into the pork inside the canelones.  



We didn't eat all that much, but our bill was about $900 for the six of us.  If the food had been spectacular, I would have said it was completely worth it, but the food wasn't even ""great.""  What a waste, but I guess that's the risk you take for wanting to try a different fancy restaurant.  Just because it looks and seems fancy certainly does not guarantee a great culinary experience.

First off, it took my group a bit to find the place, with the restaurant not marked properly. Our confusion was resolved when we stumbled on it and they told us we had arrived. We only saw markings for China Poblano, so the confusion never really went away. 



After we sat down and started reviewing the menu, we started asking the waitress questions about the menu. Thankfully we brought up my allergy to shell fish because the whole fried section of the menu was hands off, even if items didn't have shell fish in it. Turns out they fry everything in the same oil - chicken, dates, shrimp... not a best practice they should continue. 



The dishes I was able to eat were good, but honestly, the dishes did not go far at all.

I came here with a group of 13 girls, and we were required to eat from a $75 per person set menu.  Here's what we were served:

* Endives with goat cheese, oranges, almonds 

* Toasted bread brushed with diced tomato

* Jamon 

* Gazpacho shooters 

* Roasted red peppers and eggplant

* Chicken croquetas

This might look like a lot of food, but the first 6 items were actually only a bite or two per person. With the exception of the enormous paella (cooked in a pan wider than our table and brought to the table for pictures before it was divvied up), the portions were all fairly small. Several of us were still very hungry at the end of the meal. 



The endives, gazpacho, and skirt steak were my favorites. I did not like the use of sweet fruit in the Brussels sprouts and spinach. I love paella, and I was not happy with the paella, which tasted smoky and burnt but was not very flavorful otherwise. The croquetas were a bit too salty and were brought to the table in paper cones stuck into black tennis shoes. Nobody explained the significance of the shoe to us, and it felt random to everyone and gross to some. 



The meal came out to about $104 each (including sangria, tax, and tip), which felt expensive for what we got. I guess you have to factor in the normal Vegas premium and the large group premium.



On top of that, we got slightly jipped by Jaleo. The original reservation was for 15 people. One girl didn't make it to Vegas, and the other felt sick and skipped dinner.

Jaleo then suffers from another problem - they fry just about every dish. Spanish food is not necessarily heavy or populated by fried items, but Jaleo's menu is just loaded up with fried options when it simply doesn't need to be. Even the datillos con tocino (dates with bacon - an absolute tapas staple) is fried. i've never seen that, why ruin the dish by frying it?



Because of that maybe the best dish we had was the sliced apple and fennel salad - it was just so fresh and such a welcome, refreshing change. The other dish that was very good was the skirt steak with piquillo peppers - another common Tapas dish - that was done well. I love skirt steak so that helps as well since the steak was cooked well. 



So, yes, I've experienced better.",negative

ts166,9/9/2013,revtest1801,2,"Finally made it to Jaleo.... after all this time.  

Sad to say that I was very disappointed. 



The restaurant had a great vibe.  It was promising.. then our waiter came.

Because I've looked this restaurant up on Yelp.. there was one particular item that I really wanted to get.. so I pulled it up on my phone and showed our waiter.

He seemed.. bored first of all.  When I showed him what I wanted, he just kind of nodded and said the name of the dish and walked away.  I guess since we weren't ready....



We finally placed our order - about 5 tapas.

I don't recall other than the Salmon Roe Cone and the Chicken Fritter thing that was pretty good and was served in a shoe... no clue why.



Here's what I remembered from my non-eventful dinner..

1. Shrimp in Gambas  - ehhh kind of rubberty

2. The fried stuff - Good but nothing that I couldn't get at any mediocre restaurant

3. Service - Waitier was not engaged.  Told me at the end of the meal if I didn't like my anchovy dish I should have told him in the beginning... well... I'm sure he noticed that the dish was barely touched when he dropped off the other tapas.  But I do give him props for taking it off my bill.  



Sooooooo all in all.. I should have stuck with my fav.. Julian Serrano.

Jaleo... Not worth it.



PS.. I left ""hollow"" but didn't want to try any more of the food since every single one was just kind of eh!",negative

Well I have to admit that the experience has been so disappointing!



At first we were very enthusiastic because the place has a really great vibe but the waiter ruined the whole experience.

I am not talking about the waiter who seated us, brought the menus and took the order who was actually very nice but the waiter who served us.



We were sitting in the main area where there is a colorful couch surrounding one side of the room. The waiter poked my wife on the back to pass the plates from behind instead of coming to our table...he was so rude, bored...he didn't say a word (Enjoy the food for example ???...). If you don't like the job, just don't do it...



We were going to order more food but we decided to pass after the third plate was brought to us by the same guy and in the same way.



Food was not that great either...I really don't know what the amazing José Andrés chef would think about a raw tortilla or over fried calamari...



I know that ""bad nights"" happen...but there is nothing worse than wanting to try a restaurant for so long and be disappointed after all!

My wife and I were very excited to try something different than the usual sushi or steak restaurants on the strip.  We love tapas and have some great options in Boston where we live.  We couldn't wait to try another take on Spanish tapas.



Located in the beautiful Cosmopolitan, Jaleo is very cutely decorated and lively.  Our server was pretty rushed the whole evening and was not very attentive.  



Unfortunately, the tapas are a real let-down.  We started with the lomo iberico (type of ham) and a selection of Spanish cheese.  Very small pieces and not served with bread.  We had to ask and pay for bread separately.  Who serves ham and cheese without bread.  In all the times we have had tapas, this had never happened.  Next we got the dates wrapped in bacon.  Incredibly salty.  Almost inedible.  The sauteed cauliflower was very good and the lone high point of the meal.  The mini pork burgers were pretty good but quite greasy.  The lamb skewer was so lemony it was hard to eat.  Finally the sauteed mushrooms were pretty good but a bit undercooked.  Like other reviewers have noted, the portions are small.  You could very well leave hungry like we did.  We ordered 7 tapas for 2 people!



We did not try dessert because nothing about the meal thus far had suggested the desserts were going to be any better.

First, do not go with more than 2, maybe 4, people in your group. This should be considered a mediocre date place. This is not a big group place at all. Don't think ""oh, but it's tapas and we'll order multiple dishes""...The dishes came out one by one, not double for each side of the table. The portions are much smaller than the average tapas restaurant. I've been all over Spain and you know what? They serve larger portions. 



Our waitress was pissy, rude and we had to practically BEG for a 2 round of drinks. There were 14 of us and we said ""double everything"". She brought out each round one at a time to the whole table. Awful. 



Drinks sucked. I had 3 cocktails -- mostly soda and mixers. The ensalada russa was mayonaise. Nothing like the ensalada russa I'm used too (I grew up on this stuff). Everything was fried. The octopus was disgusting -- gooey and chewy with little flavor. The cheese platter had 2 slices of cheese per type and they were teeny tiny.

The appetizer chorizo sausage they brought out served at room temperature/cold was ""ok"" at best. Definitely nothing exciting and not recommended. The tomato bread was also ""ok"" - toasted bread with some tomato spread. Overall this tasted like Bruschetta and was loaded with vinegar (tons of sodium). So moving on and at this point they are 0 for 2. Next up was the soup in the glass cup which again was nothing to brag about. 0 for 3 - then there was the salad swimming in the sherrie vinaigrette - 0 for 4.

The place decor is really nice and you could see a whole pig being roasted on an open fire in the middle of the food prep area. The servers were nice, attentive, and helpful with our questions. 



We ordered up the paella feast, which includes beet gazpacho, a salad with some fancy sounding vinaigrette, and a paella plate. The place decor is really nice and you could see a whole pig being roasted on an open fire in the middle of the food prep area.



The gazpacho was presented in a very fancy fashion and was served inside a neat modern cup, drizzle with some olive oil, topped with fresh-looking oval croutons. However, one bite in and the taste of salt just overpowered all the other flavors. I could still eat it but I felt as if I was eating condensed gazpacho.



Then was the salad. The salad was literally a couple large lettuce leaves with 5 olives, two slices of tomato and red onion dressed in some vinaigrette. We thought they forgot to bring out a second salad serving but the waitress had placed the bowl in the middle of our table which made me realize that it was meant to share. A bit stingy and didn't really seem like restaurant quality.



Finally, we waited on the paella. We figured the paella would be wonderful and rich and full of flavor. Instead we received plates of undercooked rice (supposedly al dente..) and extremely dry chicken. The entire place was hard to chew and tasted too salty.



Overall, I would not go back here again and I wouldn't recommend my friends to come here. The overall experience did not satisfy me especially for the price. Really beautiful place though.",negative

The kitchen was out of most items, granted it was a late dinner, but the waiter made an offhand remark about us coming late, and came after we were served to tell us that the item we asked about on the menu had come back to life. 



The food came dry, not at all fresh, and clearly left for at least an hour after it's even made. The tapas were overpriced and the sizes were small even for tapas.

For some reason the temperature at the restaurant is set to below freezing, which makes being there really uncomfortable.  I felt like grabbing the manager and saying: look, this is the Cosmopolitan, do you not see all these poor women sitting here half naked and shivering?  You need to shut the bloody AC off!



They have a foosball table outside which doubles up as a dining table for six.  It is a super fun idea and a super impractical one at the same time.  The seats are shaped like saddles so there is no back support- there is in fact very little bottom support - you kind of hover in mid air half the time trying not to fall off completely - much like being on a real saddle I suppose!  Best of all, the poles in the table provide a great opportunity to file a lawsuit against the establishment since you can easily stab and seriously damage the person sitting across from you if you're not careful.  



Been here twice but I don't think will be back again; at their prices it's just not worth it.  Even if I end up with a bunch of the better dishes, it's simply not a relaxing enough environment to make the experience fully enjoyable.

I did not know what to order. The whimsical descriptions were bothering me and made  none of the descriptions clear. Our new waiter gave us a few recommendations and we chose to start with toasted slices of uniquely crispy bread and sautéed spinach with pine nuts, raisins, and apples. What does uniquely crispy bread even mean? Anyways both dishes were overly salted. The bread was a rendition of bruschetta and tasted soggy. Spinach could have been good with the combination of ingredients but once again all I could taste was salt in my mouth. After these dishes, I decided to not order anything else off the menu.

It's not that the concept isn't intriguing. Tapas restaurants are an excellent concept which can provide fantastic flavor combinations and lots of options for customers to choose from. When you're traveling with a group, it's great to order several tapas and share.



I also want to be clear that I think the staff at Jaleo was top notch, friendly, and timely. I appreciated that on a busy Thursday night.



The problem with this place wasn't the concept or the service. The problem was the food.



I went with a group of six people and personally tried 5 different tapas during the course of the meal. We would have ordered several more if the food wasn't so underwhelming.



What I tried:



The ""pan de cristal con tomate fresco,"" which was $12, was some dry, stale bread with what tasted like a can of tomato sauce dumped on top. It was sloppy. It was flavorless.



The ""croquetas de pollo"" ($12), were served in a shoe. Literally, the food was in a paper cone that was place inside of an old shoe. Why would anyone think that's clever or appetizing? The croquetas were decently cooked, but still lacked flavor.



The ""gambas al ajillo"" ($16), were flavorful, but the portion size was minuscule for a $16 dish.



The ""remolacha con cítricos"" ($12) was drenched in the dressing, though it wasn't bad otherwise.



The worst of it all, in my view:



""José's patatas bravas"" ($6) was seriously a individually-sized bag of potato chips (you know, the one they'd sell for $0.50 in a vending machine) covered in mayo and sriracha. They even took up a third of the plate with the empty bag cut in half, as if that was something that would impress a diner. The chips weren't great (most of them were crushed), and the sauce combination was fine, but this was an embarrassing thing to have on the menu in my view. An absolute shame.



The consensus about this place from those of us who had dinner that night and tried tapas other than those I listed was that it was the worst meal we had in our weeklong stay in LV.



I'm by no means someone who expects to have a five star meal every time I go out, and I understand the Vegas expense is always higher than it is other cities. I also understand that in a busy shift, some meals don't always turn out as well as they should. But the fact that all of the tapas we ordered had serious flaws is indicative of a systemic issue in the restaurant.

The restaurant seem like a hip place with modern décor and had a fun atmosphere.  After perusing the menu, we opted for the beet salad, lamb chops, paella valencian (with beans, rabbit and chicken), salmon with cauliflower, jamon iberico, and pan con tomato (bread with tomato).



The beet salad was very unremarkable and the beets weren't very tasty.  The lamb chops were cooked perfectly, albeit overseasoned.  There was a mint sauce that looked nice but didn't add much in terms of flavor.  The paella was very uneven.  The chicken was well cooked and juicy, but everything else was disappointing. The beans were overcooked, the rice was undercooked, and the rabbit was overcooked.  The salmon with cauliflower was slightly undercooked (that didn't bother me) but the skin was just way too salty.  The jamon iberico was decent, but unmemorable.  The pan con tomato was probably the best because it was simple, yet elegant.

Getting the check took over 10 minutes, and getting the card back was another 15min. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!



The food was not mind blowing, and the paella had an odd bitter stinky taste for the chicken and rabbit, but it was still good. The veggie paella I can do without and I wanted to cancel that order because it took 35 minutes to come out. I literally spent hours at this place waiting for crap to come out.



The fennel salad, don't bother, the apples were too sour, it doesn't compliment the overly dressed fennel. 



The scallops were not bad, but damn were they small and expensive, only comes in a pair!



The mini sliders were not sliders, they were button size, super tiny for $8 each.



The roasted cauliflower was good, though throwing some mushrooms would have been nice.

Wife and I were terribly disappointed. Far from the romantic, fancy, or elegant dining experience we expected. 



Décor - Do not come here expecting an elegant or fancy dining experience. Tables and chairs are cheap with visible wear and tear. Restaurant itself is placed in the middle of what can only be described as a strip mall of other restaurants. Deceivingly casual compared to how they market this restaurant online. 



Service - While our server was friendly, he lacked professionalism, tried way too hard to be our friends opposed to our waiter, and drew away from our dining experience with cheesy lines and his life story. What's more, we had to listen to him do the same shtick to the tables around us throughout our meal. 



Food - we did like the food. The boiled octopus, Ibarra plate, cured black-foot prosciutto, and suckling pig (only available Sundays) were absolutely delicious. The paella however was disappointing and over-salted. Portions were fine, but our biggest gripe was that everything is just far more expensive than it should be for the quality of food offered.

ordered a few dishes

started with the cheese plate selection....bad

the one that sticks out was a goat cheese brie???? positively awful, kind of what I would imagine a urinal cake tasting like....had to spit out in napkin...that bad



went on to apple and fennel salad, again bad choice

not sure how you screw up this one, maybe a bit heavy handed with Sherry/vinegar?

in any case, sent this back as well



third, tried the cauliflower, which was cooked ok, but the dusting of paprika kind of killed the taste for us



fourth came the lamb, probably the only edible dish of the night, cooked well, but a bit heavy handed with the salt.....edible at least



fifth, the paella with various vegetables, which they told us into our meal was not available (went bad?)

offered us the remaining available one, chicken and rabbit, but by that time we were pretty much done with this place, and why take the second best of only two choices of paella available that night?



I can say that the service was decent, and that even though we did not have a good meal....or any meal at all, the manager was extremely attentative. It was refreshing that he came to our table after the first two dishes were taken away and he noticed we had not touched much of either. I really hate to give the place such a low rating based on his concerns. Not too many places would show such concern, and especially on the strip, most would probably have just let us suffer.

ts167,3/14/2011,revtest1833,1,I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow.

Unfortunately my sub came up short with lack of taste and toppings.  When we pulled up I noticed it was super busy and was thinking man they must have great subs for it to be so packed.  Was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasn't as clean as others have stated in other reviews.  I had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor.  I had the Chipotle Cheese Steak sub that I split with my husband.  The bread tasted ok, but it wasn't fresh out of the oven. They skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it.  For the price of the sandwich I really was expecting to get more.  The sauce was the best thing about it but I was wanting more of it as well.  I won't be going back.

The tuna hoagie is crap, don't get it.  It is sloppy wet and soaks the roll.  

They have apparently changed vendors for their meats.  The turkey is almost tasteless.  The meats for the Italian Sub are also not what they used to be.

 

We called the Happy Valley store to complain after we discovered the changes.  The 'person in charge' said that 'corporate' had changed the supplier for the tuna and they knew it was awful.  So, why didn't you tell me before I bought the sandwich?  If you know it's that bad, why are you serving it?

The guy taking my payment (or another employee) obviously didn't agree because today, on my bank statement, there is an initial authorization for $30 and a final charge of $33. So they gave themselves a $3 tip without my authorization.

This is Bonfire's first week open, so hopefully they are just working out the kinks, and it gets better soon.  Hottie and I went for Happy hour and dinner on Friday.  I wasn't thrilled with any of their HH drink specials, so I just ordered one of their specialty martini's with Prosseco and some other yummy goodness! I loved my martini, which is good because I realized they were 11 bucks a pop when I got the bill!  Hottie ordered a Stella on tap, but was served a bud light, they served him another... same thing. I am convinced they had the kegs switched up.   For appetizers we ordered fried pickles (Hottie's choice) and grilled artichoke.  The pickles were dipped in a thick batter similar to that of fish and chips- Ick!  The artichoke was okay, but covered in oil... I mean my hands were dripping.   For dinner Hottie ordered some ""Jumbo Prawn"" and Andouille Sausage skewer with a side of baked beans.  His ""Prawns"" were not jumbo and they were obviously shrimp. His food was covered in oil too... I grill a lot at home and you don't need very much oil, that's what's great about grilling!  For dinner, I ordered three sides, truffle and parmesan mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and grilled asparagus.  The asparagus was excellent, the mac n cheese was okay, nothing special, and the potatoes were bland and dry... big disappointment.  To end on a positive note, our service was good, and the concept is fresh, so I suppose we'll be back to give them opportunity for redeem themselves...we'll just give them some time to get on their game!",negative
ts170,4/1/2011,revtest1849,1,"I hate to beat up a place too much, as we ate there just days after opening and there's always kinks to work out with the menu and service.  I will say the server was nice and they tried really hard.  They also had about 5 hostesses on staff so there was no wait to be seated.



However--and this is a big however--the food was awful.  Awful as in the worst meal I've had dining out in years.  In addition to the tempura fried pickles missing the mark (batter was just odd), the Stella tap clearly being hooked up to the Bud Light keg (my palate isn't that refined but I can tell BL from SA) everything was not just ""meh"" but cooked in a way you would cook food for your worst enemy.  The baked beans were worse than the cheapest canned beans you could buy, the mashed potatoes LL ordered made instant potatoes desireable, and the mac n' cheese made me long for Kraft.



Believe it or not, with all this being bad--it's not the worse!  First, the HH specials are probably the weakest I've ever seen...why even have them?  The ONLY specials are domestic draws.  That's it.  Nothing off the $11 martinis.  Nothing off import drafts.  REALLY???  My last gripe is the entree, advertised as ""prawns"" with andouille sausage.  Not prawns.  Regular friggin' shrimp.  Maybe 5 total.   Drowned in oil.  On a stick.  $2 worth of food for $20.



Oh, and BTW the whole ""concept"" is everything goes on a stick (even the sandwiches).  And the whole focus point of the decor is some cheesy fire ""screensaver"" projected on a wall.



So in closing...I guess I was hard on the place.  But the server was nice.  If it's around next year the owner has some deep pockets.  You expect hiccups with a new place, but build-out on this took several months which is more than enough time to put together a menu.  Enough, I don't want to relive the meal!",negative

ts170,8/20/2011,revtest1852,2,"I first went to Bonfire Grill and Bar on 8/12 with a friend and we ordered two apps each, they were: skewered grilled cheese sandwich, the skewered handmade pork meatballs, the tenderbelly st. louis pork ribs and the salt and pepper fried pork belly biscuits. Our visit to the restaurant was at around 9:30p and were surprised to see only a few diners. Let me say that the food served at Bonfire Grill is pretty good. Of course, the pork ribs could have a less sweeter sauce and something with a little more kick but overall every small plate we ordered was yum. I also got myself the Sangria which was refreshing. My two star review is simply because of bad service. 



From the start, getting the attention of our server proved to be a task, water refills had to be asked for as well as giving the bartender/server/available person around a dirty look hoping to get their attention just for more water. I really feel that bad or lackluster service regardless of how good the food can ruin the dining experience. Granted on our first visit there, the food and drink made up for the lack of service that I made the decision when I left that I would come back. FASTFORWARD to 8/19. I mentioned Bonfire to two friends and was able to get them to come out for dinner and try out Bonfire. I reassured them that it was a good place to go to, and on the drive to Bonfire I started salivating over the yummy salt and pepper fried pork belly biscuits. 



This time around again on a friday night, the Bonfire was happening. A band was playing and upon walking in, the restaurant was busy and almost full. We were given a choice to sit at either a table or booth, and we chose the booth. My second dining experience at Bonfire and my friends first was doomed from the moment we chose the booth to sit at. Upon closer look, the table was not clean, and we had to wait for it to be cleaned after having to ask someone to do that. Upon seating, menus were handed to us, and the service ENDED there. We were seated at 9:45p and no waters were served or was a drink order even taken from the time we sat down, at 10:05p, with no server in sight to even check on us or even assist us, my friends and I were ANNOYED. I even decided I was gonna call the resto from the booth to inform them that the corner booth we were at was being IGNORED by their staff. 20 minutes of no acknowledgement or service whatsoever is unacceptable. After waiting 20 minutes, failing to get the attention of a server or any server whatsoever, we decided to leave. I am dismayed that a restaurant in old town that has promise suffers from a severe lack of customer service. Regardless of how busy your resto might be, I would hope your staff are trained to realize which table might need assistance and whatnot, Bonfire showed a lack of care, and has marred any positives I may have held in regard towards this resto. Bad customer service = a bad dining experience and hence my two stars.",negative
ts170,8/20/2011,revtest1853,1,"If I were writing this review on food alone, I'd give the place like 4 stars. They have really good food. They have this awesome pork belly biscuit app that is yummy. Good grilled cheese sandwich with some bacon and arugula that makes it a bit different from the usual. They have a good sangria that's like juice. I was looking forward to trying out different stuff when I went again, but I ran into the same problem, but magnified that I ran into last time I went, and that was poor service. 



I and a group of my friends went back, wanting them to experience the food as well. And we went on a Friday night around 9:30 and, as expected, it was busy. Now, the last time I went, it was another Friday night around 8 and their place was slow, like the only tables in were ours, a table of 6 on a high top, and a few other patrons at the bar. Service was slow then too. I chalked it up to the fact that our server was pulling double duty and playing bartender. 



But tonight was different. It was busy. It was like 15-20 minutes before happy hour, the band was going and the place was packed, like the usual restaurants in the area on a Friday night. And tonight, we were seated fairly quickly. Well, more like we were escorted to our table and then stood around, waiting for it to be bussed, but we were fine with that. We were able to sit down and peruse the menu. We were trying to make up our mind, when the person we thought was the server came over. It turned out that the guy wasn't our server, just a guy dropping off the silverware and plates. He apologized and corrected us in our error and assured us that our server would come by shortly. 



Well that didn't happen. People came by, and they kept on going by. At one time, one my friends attempted to call the restaurant in order to get someone to get to the table, but no one answered. Maybe the band was too loud or maybe they just don't answer their phones. It was then, that was had a glimmer of hope - a server heading in our direction. And what did this server do?

The place looked really cool with its interactive menu and good-looking food. 

The interactive menu is a screen on the table that allows you to choose what you want to eat, look at prices, call a waiter etc.

This touch screen creation ended up being the restaurants downfall.



My friends and i went on a friday around 4 pm. The restaurant was virtually empty so we figured we'd get great service.

Our waiter seated us and showed us how to use the interactive menu. Fun and entertaining concept except when you keep trying to click on something and it won't do it. 

We ordered a pizza, sushi burger, and lamb burger.

Food arrived shortly after we sent the order and tasted good. No complaints about the food (i would have liked sweet potato fries but they didn't have any)

While we were eating our waiter never came to see if  we enjoyed our food or needed anything. We did need something... water.

So i clicked on call the waiter on the interactive menu..... no one ever came. We had to flag someone down that was walking past our table. 



In the end, the ""cool"" aspect of iburger didn't work.

Service failed miserably. 

How much should you tip the waiter if he does nothing? 15% seemed excessive and i usually tip 20% on an okay dinner.

It's like every mediocre thing they have in CA, it must be imported here to please the transplants and the AZ residents that have CA envy.  Unfortunately for The Habit Burger Grill, this is more like the mediocre CPK than it is the fantastic In n Out.  



The burger's are 1/4lb so to get 1 patty for $4 (without fries and a drink) is outrageous, especially when I can get a double double meal for around $5-6.  I went with the double with fries and a drink and it was over $8.  Burger was average, fries mediocre.  For people that eat in they even use the same burger diapers In n Out uses.  



I don't know what was up with the place, they literally had 10-15 employees working when I was there.  There were 6 of us dining in.  Maybe that's why it is so pricey, they have too many people to pay.  This place may appease the LA transplants that feel everything is better from back home but I don't see too many people deciding to spend $3 more for inferior food than a drive thru like In n Out.  



The only thing ""habit"" about this place is that I'm going to make a habit of not going back.  I also didn't understand why they felt the need to give out the vibrating thing as I waited for my order.  I wasn't waiting for a table, I was waiting for a bag of food.

The french fries were actually really good - they reminded me a little bit of McDonald's fries, but thicker in size. Seasoned about the same.

If you want decent sushi, do yourself a favor and go down the street to Muramoto. Otherwise, go for some other cuisine. Red Sushi is a place to avoid--especially at the absurd prices they charge.



Rolls are a way for restaurants to mask the freshness of their fish. I tried the Nigiri and my friend got the sashimi--not good. Not fresh. You can tell when something isn't up to speed, and this clearly lacked, well...everything.



And look--I know that I shouldn't have high expectations, considering most sushi in the Midwest is bleh at best, but for the prices they charge, this is simply outrageous.

ts174,7/9/2012,revtest1885,2,"My husband and I recently moved to Madison from LA, so I'm trying to understand the total lack of good service in town.  This is the first sushi bar I've ever been to (and  I have been to MANY), where when seated at the actual bar, I couldn't order directly from the sushi chef.  I get the impression from most of the recent reviews that the majority of customers here have never been to real sushi, and didn't think this was an abnormality.



We waited a good half hour to get a seat at the sushi bar, but that wasn't a big deal, as we gave the hostess our cell number and went for a walk.  When we were called back, she tried to seat us at a table, when there were 5 seats open at the bar.  She recovered, and when we finally sat down at the sushi bar and tried to make conversation with the chef/owner and order.  He didn't indicate at all that we needed to order from anyone else, but after 10 minutes of awkward chatting/waiting, our waitress came and said that we had to order from her.  



We had the hostess and our waitress talk up a scallop special and their rolls, so ordered a the scallop (a cold and hot combo), a crunchy tuna roll and a lolipop roll (both recommended).  The scallop sashimi was good, but the cooked part of the appetizer was greasy and overcooked, and I'm not sure where the actual scallop was.  Both of the rolls were visually pretty but very underwhelming.  We were given our first order rapid-fire without our sake.  After 20 minutes, our waitress came back and asked us if she'd forgotten our sake, and another 10 minutes after we'd refused the sake, she came back and apologized and offered us a small sake on the house (we'd ordered a bottle, not a small).



We're pretty picky about our rolls, so we figured we'd just spend the rest of the evening eating nigiri and sashimi.  The actual nigiri and sashimi were good here, and as another yelper said, the uni in particular was good. What the owner served us as hamachi however was definitely snapper, and the toro was medium toro at best.",negative

Throughout our evening he did warm up a bit and checked on us two times.  The hostess was rather rude, and ignored us altogether when refilling the other customers' water.



Drinks:  The martinis were wonderful, I highly suggest the Lyche martini.



Sushi: Was wonderful as usual, very fresh and believe it or not we got it right after ordering.  (In the past we have waited 30 plus minutes for sushi and the place wasn't even busy).

ts174,2/8/2013,revtest1888,1,"Abysmal.  Horrible service and mediocre at best sushi.  



to be fair the toro and escolar sushi were both pretty good...actually some of the best I've had in Madison (which doesn't say much).  being fortunate enough to have really great omakase sushi experiences before, this sushi is for people who don't know sushi.



Now let me get to the crux of the matter, the horrid service.  While all of the female staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, the dude taking our order behind the sushi bar was horrible.  Strangely we didn't order from the sushi chef, which is what one comes to expect when they belly up to a sushi bar.  Instead we were served by some guy who clearly didn't want to be there.  When he asked how our half eaten uni sushi order was, we told him it was chemical tasting (which is was, there is no confusing that taste).  He struck up a defensive tone and told us that no one else had ever complained about their uni before......ummmmmmmmm, what? Guess what buddy, someone just did and that ain't the way to handle it.  And then that was all he said, no I'm sorry to hear that, no did you want to try something else, it was all attitude.  Maybe that flies with the college age crowd downing sake bombs and slathering their sushi with cream cheese all to the backdrop of thumping club music but legit service or sushi restaurant this does not make.



I'm done with this place, I'll stick with Takumi out on the eastside for my next perfectly acceptable but mediocore midwestern sushi fix. Even Whole Foods or Willy St Coop has better sushi than Red.

ts174,2/14/2013,revtest1889,1,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SERVICE NOT THE SUSHI...sushi was actually pretty good!



Being busy is never an excuse for poor service. And poor service we did receive. Funny enough, we sat at the bar, where you usually get great service, given that you're right in front of the bartender and sushi counter. 



It was a Saturday night, and yes, it was busy. We waited about 40 minutes for a table, which was fine, as we went down the street to grab a beer while waiting. A couple minutes after we sat down at the bar/counter, we were ready to order drinks. It took the waitress/bartender about 15 minutes to take our order...she kept saying she would be with us in a minute after we flagged her down. 



Ordered drinks along with some rolls. After 15 minutes or so, we still did not have our drinks. We asked and the waitress said they would be right up. To our surprise, our rolls came out and still no drinks! Halfway into eating, we asked about drinks again and said to just forget them since we'd be finished eating by the time they came out, at the rate they were going. 



The bartender/waitress kept telling us she was ""SO BUSY"" every time we asked for something. Really? Not even a genuine apology. And who tells their customers they're super busy and expects that to make everything ok? Really?

We had a party of 6 and were told our wait would be 35-45 minutes. After 45 minutes, we asked the hostess how long it would be and she said ""15 minutes, the table we are waiting for just paid their bill"". 27 minutes later, I went up to the hostess and told her we have been waiting for over 70 minutes and to get the manager. I asked the manager what she can do for us (complementary drinks while we finish waiting) and she said ""there's nothing I can do, you can either leave or wait until the table is ready"". The people who just paid their bill were still sitting there talking away and getting water from their servers! It wasn't until i talked to the server himself and asked him to let the table know that others are waiting that we were finally seated. Do not go here with a party bigger than 4. Restaurant is small and not conducive to big parties, due to what seemed to be management's refusal to combine tables from different servers and lack of using effective strategies to move people along. There was nothing offered to us to satisfy our wait that was double what they originally told us.

ts175,5/31/2011,revtest1894,1,"I am trying to be kind, but not a great experience, online, in person, or dining with/at NakedPizza.



I had gotten their flyer extoling all their virtues before the holiday break recently, and so the weekend seemed like a good time to try them.



No online coupons, nor flyer coupons, but I tried both regular and thin crust with both pepperoni and mushroom toppings.  I used their website, which was not especially intuitive, nor fast on updates-- as compared to other pizza places--  and it ended up getting the order wrong, so I called the place and they could not modify the order at all, and ended up doing an entire new order, cheerfully.  They got the total wrong, but then adjusted it with a managers [?] help.  



My pizzas were ready ontime, however, there seemed to be a lack of individuals who were able to help me.  While quite a few of the employees were standing around near the front desk, they did not offer to help, nor seemed to be doing anything in the back.  When one of the front counter girls got free from phone, they did give me the pizzas and I was on my way.



Alas, after all the hype and wait above, both pizza's, while warm, and reasonably fresh, did not taste it.  The touted 12 grain crust actually tasted like bad wheat bread, with very little flavor.  The sauce was nearly invisible, and did not add to the pizza.  Same for rest of toppings -- basically a very dull, if neutral note.  Neither crust was crispy, nor tasty, or had any good texture to it.



I can not blame the company, as perhaps this is their ""all natural way""  but when compared to many other pizza places, both cheap and expensive I have been to, I can not ever recommend this place/their pizza's again.



It was not just me, I had friends over, and the vote was uniamious, with the comment  ""Freschetta frozen is better than this!""



I am trying to think of any redeeming values, but I can not.  I think you should avoid this place, and seek your pizza nirvana elsewhere -- Pizzeria Bianco is quite good, as is Grimaldi's [the one by BluBurger and Flemings]",negative

I have a problem with no freaky chemicals are added as the website says but the truth is they do add probiotics to the crust.



We've recently tried the thin crust pizzas and found the crust flavorless sort of like a matzoh cracker but sort of like a tortilla with a burnt edge.



The sauce is almost flavorless , how do you take out flavor from tomatoes? I don't know? I threw my own seasonings on to make it taste better.



Mozzarella cheese that is lightly topping the pizza is almost flavorless.



I think this is extremely expensive considering you only get a (basically) 10in tortilla for $7.50 with almost nothing on it if you order one topping. This pizza wasn't filling one bit either for the first time in my life I ate a whole pizza. (I normally only eat one or two slices maybe three if I am pigging and the pieces are small)



We are not fans and my husband had high anger issues after trying this pizza he kept screaming to me to only give one star but I think maybe it deserves two stars?  only because it isn't as bad as others I've tried near here , at best I think this is only suitable for appetizers when you are having guest if you can't cook.

Convenient to order and pickup (no dine-in available). But after numerous attempts the only this about Naked Pizza that is consistent is its inconsistency. The crust is generally good, the sauce is tasty. But when it comes to toppings it's like placing a bet on a roulette wheel because you never know what you'll get.



Last night we got an email as part of their promotional program. Great prices on large and medium 1-topping pizzas. We ordered two. Got them home, opened the box and there was literally one ingredient on each slice of pizza. One. 



Now I can understand profit margins are tight but in my opinion, if you can't produce a quality pizza for the price you're offering in your promotion, then don't do it. As the meal went on, we weren't talking about how much we liked the pizza or the restaurant's concept, we were talking about what a disappointment it was. That's too bad. We have had occasions in the past where the pizza was loaded with cheese and healthy toppings but it would usually be followed up with a pizza that was all sauce, no cheese and little toppings on the next. 



For a takeout place, Naked Pizza is turning out to be a lot like Deal or No Deal. You're excited about the possibility about getting something good but there's a pretty good chance you're going to walk away disappointed too. 



I really hope they realize their potential and as time goes on they iron out the bumps and standardize the quality. It's one thing to save 30¢ on ingredients on a pizza but it costs a whole lot more to attract and keep new customer. I only hope they learn that lesson before it's too late.

ts178,10/1/2013,revtest1913,2,"It's been a while since my last review. Two years in fact (ouch, how time flies). The first time, I liked the whisky and the burger. Not too shabby.



The most recent time, I had to wait 40 minutes for 2 cocktails, and when I received the cocktail I had two sips and put it down, sorely disappointed.



It was the midst of the Festival. But the bar wasn't busy. It was 'normal busy' not Fringe busy. I also watched the guy make my cocktail, following a recipe book step-by-step. It was just, quite frankly, a sweet, watery, syrupy mess.



For whiskies, well they have whiskies and they're nice. Although when my friend ordered one they had run out. And the suggested replacement - they were also out.



The service was so slow, and not apologetic about it at all. The cocktail wasn't great. And I know of other places to go for a whisky. So I don't see myself heading back here any time soon.",negative
ts179,9/3/2011,revtest1914,2,"Lets start with the positives.  The staff here is super friendly.  Everyone behind the counter is in good spirits and looks to be enjoying their time as much as possible during work hours.  They also have free peanuts upon arrival, much to the like of the Teakwoods bar establishment in the valley.  Those would be the two positives encompassing the lack of just wiping the floor with Five Guys and giving them the one star rating.



I ordered the normal burger, which is actually two patties as opposed to the little burger which is just one patty.  I added the bacon, grilled mushrooms, grilled onions lettuce, tomato, and light mayo. I made sure to ask for light mayo, because there does not need to a gallon of it on my hamburger, like most places in town like to garner.  Of course I am going to try the french fries, so an order of those went on the bill to conclude.  After a short wait, I collected my order and proceeded to survey the land. 



The hamburger is tasteless, there is no other way to say it. It is not good. Its not an opinion, this burger is just plain garbage.  Perhaps the staff could take the half gallon of salt they are putting on the fries and move a partial amount to the meat, because there is quite simply no seasoning and thus no taste. Ah yes, a nice treat, my light mayo was in fact slathered all over the top and bottom of the bun, always fun to take the mass napkins given to me to deconstruct the burger, wipe off superfluous mayo and return burger to original state. I took two bites and through the burger away, its just not good.



The fries are decent, I suppose. Maybe I was just really hungry from not eating the burger I had such high hopes to enjoy.  So much for Five Guys, total bust.



Note of review, the establishment does happen to have those cool tech soda machines that let you mix all sorts of different soft drinks together. I made a 50/50 coke zero lemon/lime mix.

The problem is the food.  We got 2 burgers, hot dog and fries.  The fries I thought were decent but over salted.  The hot dog was nothing special and the burger was a let down.  I was really expecting a in-n-out style burger and walked away with a smashburger experience.  All Hype no follow thru.  I was also shocked that a place that prides themselves on their burgers and relying on one product they don't ask how you would like it cooked.  Even when ordering a burger at Chile's I am asked how I would like it done



I have to say I was surprised, seeing as they are Zagat rated I was expecting a lot more.  The concept is fresh, clean and I like the peanuts you can munch on while you stand in line and wait for your order.

They're just not that great. They remind me of something I would pull off of the grill in the backyard.

The cups they use to hold the fries are about one third smaller and the ""extra"" fries they toss in have been cut by half. For the burger, fries and drink I had, the bill was just under $18. I can go to a sports bar I like in Scottsdale and have a selection of sandwiches with plentiful fries, a bottomless soft drink and with tip get out of there for less than my Five Guys bill AND have someone serve it to me on a plate.

The salads and dessert were quite tasty, but mains were disappointing.



While they claim steak is what they're ""known for,"" after spending $30+ for a 16 oz rib-eye, I can comfortably shoot down that claim. It was a cheap cut of meat which looked like it had been pan fried on a wet pan (steamed). No fire marks, no smokiness. Mushy with almost as much fat and gristle as meat - meaning I had about 9 oz of edible steak.



No bread. No butter. Sides are not included. I ordered a béarnaise sauce ($4) and it was obviously pre-made sauce from carton - not fresh.



My girlfriend ordered a burger. Tasteless and bland. Didn't finish it.



If it's a steakhouse, the steaks should be good. Especially with the high prices. It's just not worth what they're charging and if I were the owner I would be ashamed. It's a joke - or a really, really bad night with the chef on vacation.



Even the water tasted like soap. Served in a poorly rinsed glass.



Atmosphere was strange. Cool lights and design, but blasting dance music throughout the place by a live DJ made it difficult to talk to anyone else at our table.

It was a pretty full house; we were seated on the tail end of a Christmas party who had a table to spare. The only downside - we were seated right next to the DJ booth, so conversation was a little difficult. When our waitress finally came around to take our order, we started with the spinach dip; it was pretty good, served with homemade pita chips. The serving of pita chips was off compared to the amount of spinach given. Luckily, when we asked for additional chips, they were given to us free of charge. For our main courses, I had the grilled chicken sandwich with fries (what pulled me in was the mango mayo listed in the description), and my boyfriend had the pulled porc sandwich with onion rings. In a word, I was disappointed; the chicken was overcooked and kind of dry. On the other hand, my boyfriend's pulled porc sandwich was actually quite good; it was flavourful, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. 



In all, it was alright, but nothing I would write home about. I would have much rathered The Keg or even Baton Rouge, given the prices this place charges.

The chicken salad didn't come as described on the menu.  It had maraschino cherries  instead of dried cranberries.

If they were out of so many things, they should have told us when we ordered it.  The salad just tasted like lettuce with very little other flavor. 



The won ton soup also had no flavor.  The broth tasted like boiled water and the vegetables and dumplings added nothing to the soup.



Likewise, the 2 main dishes were OK, but lacked any real flavor. I added soy sauce (which I never do) so that it would taste like something.



We tried to explain these problems to the server, but got nowhere.  She didn't even say she was sorry for the poor food.  She really needs to learn how to be a server at a restaurant.  She needs to carry customer comments to the kitchen and apologize to the customer that they weren't happy.

We were the only ones in the restaurant and ordered the following 5 dishes for lunch:  beef chow fun, sweet & sour pork, crispy sole filet, HK chow mein with chicken, and chicken with mushroom.  The only thing that tasted good was the beef chow fun.  The s/s pork was okay;  and fish didn't taste to fresh, dry but was still edible.  The two chicken plates had a funny taste to it, kind of sour maybe used old chicken.



The guy that took the order also cooked the food.  It took a while to cook the food.  But after taking our order and bringing in our food, no one asked how our food was or asked us if we wanted anymore water.  Considering we were the only ones here, I though the service would have been better since it seemed like it was a family run restaurant.

No apology offered by the hostess. The place closes at 10pm and it didn't even look busy at all. We weren't guided to the bar or offered any alternative so we went over to the bar and ordered ourselves drinks. At about 9:30 the five of us were finally brought to our table. We sat there for 10 minutes before a male waiter, we'll call him ""Perry"" because he never told us his name, came over and took our drink orders, and eventually our entree orders as well. He never offered any specials or featured dishes. My girlfriend ordered a salad and asked for blue cheese instead of feta and was met with a flat response by ""Perry"" of ""Um, I'll ask"" and had this bewildered look on his face. After we ordered, we never saw him again. The busser brought us bread and we had to ask him for water after the table next to us was seated about 30 minutes later and they were brought water immediately. We waited 60 minutes for our food to arrive and during that time we never saw 'Perry"". This prompted my friend, who's got 17 years in hospitality industry, to find a manager. He didn't find a restaurant manager but found a hotel manager who listened to our complaint and offered us a round of drinks on the house. Our food finally came and immediately noticed that the steaks were room temperature and my steak was rare instead of medium as I asked. All our steaks were dry. We also noticed that the table next to us, who were seated about 30 minutes after we were, had gotten their meal immediately after ours was brought out.

Standard Chinese buffet food must come in vast tubs from Sysco, as the Chinese dishes are absolutely identical to the Chinese dishes at every other mediocre buffet in Phoenix. This one appears to have a larger selection of non-Chinese food, including the mysterious pork tamale mentioned by others. It all tastes as if it was poured from its tub into a pan, heated through, and then trotted out to sit on its warming table. If you're determined to stuff mass quantities of food down your gullet, this will probably do the job. If you have the food sensitivity that gives stomach cramps in response to one or another cheap fat or filler, don't even walk in the door. There's fast food elsewhere in the parking lot that'll fill you up for half the price and a fraction of the misery.



The iced tea has no flavor that would confirm it's anything other than maybe used dish water, so I suppose I shouldn't complain about lack of refills. Lack of knives is more of an issue if you're recklessly served yourself a slice of ham, but. . . don't. It should be impossible to eff up buffet ham, but the ham was tasteless, with a bizarre gummy texture. After that, I was not about to try the sushi.

ts189,12/8/2013,revtest1980,1,"I ate here once before, wasn't terribly impressed but thought I would give them another chance.  Sadly, this buffet offered the same bizarre experience as my first visit, so I figured I would share.



Basically, the food is all over the map - I don't generally go to a chinese buffet to eat old pasta in watered down ketchup, or visit the taco bar (really?) Of the chinese food, 3 of the dishes were variants of ""meat with wilted broccoli"" and 2 variants of ""odd-tasting chicken in some kind of syrup"".  Seriously, that was the full extent of the chinese-related entrees on the buffet.  Some other lowlights:



a large pile of wrinkly old green beans that looked like they had been cooked in a deep fryer

3 kinds of nasty-looking, picked-apart fish in puddles of grease

teriyaki chicken slices swimming in 5/8"" of grease

breaded, deep-fried, syrup-drenched rotten (as in ""not safe to eat"") chicken

""pork tamales"" (seriously, wtf?)



More importantly, as a former chef I'm surprised the health department hasn't swooped in - every single dish was served lukewarm at best, there was no steam rising from the steam tables, and the cold trays were also at room temperature.  The nastiest thing was the tray with a lukewarm pile of old, crusty tuna salad on it - all I can say is that it was foul and i hope nobody actually ate it or the oysters next to it...  



After seeing all this, I definitely avoided the sushi bar and mongolian grill - no use in tempting fate.  Overall, I was so grossed out that I only ate one plate before leaving (for the record, I'm a biggish guy, usually I will chow down 3-4 plates at a good buffet).



In short, I know that there really are no good chinese buffets in Phoenix any more, but this was absolutely the worst food I have ever experienced anywhere in the city.

J'ai essayé beaucoup de petits comptoirs et de restos vietnamiens, mais j'ai vraiment été déçu de Vie & Nam. Je m'attendais à beaucoup mieux d'un comptoir situé en plein coeur du centre-ville, dans une foire alimentaire. Là où l'achalandage ne tarde pas à se faire sentir, surtout en saison chaude avec la course à l'air climatisé.



On vous vend un sandwich de votre choix, type Banh mi mais on vous charge 2 fois trop cher pour le si peu de viande qu'on y met avec une petite garniture fraîche (carottes, laitue, coriande, etc...). On goutte davantage la garniture et les assaisonnements que la présence de la viande. On ne trouve que ça, maintenant, à Montréal, c'est vraiment très décevant comme attitude de restaurateur. On tente ensuite de griller votre petit sandwich au four-grillette mais il en sort tout aussi blanc qu'il l'était avant.



On vous offre le combo avec petite soupe, qui est bien peu dire par rapport à la bonne soupe vietnamienne habituelle typique. Elle est fade, peu caractérisée, peu parfumée. On en sort déçu à 8,75 $ alors que ça aurait value facilement 5,95 $.



Si votre commande est pour emporter, on oublie ensuite de vous donner les ustensils mais on vous donne le sac, pour y mettre votre commande, avec une petite serviette de table au fond. Service moins qu'ordinaire, on veut vous voir repartir plus vite.



SUIVANT !



May 31st 2013

I've tried a lot of small food counters and viet places, so I was very disapointed with Vie & Nam. I thought it would be much more interesting since it's downtown, in the heart of the city's food courts. That's where people converge, espacially during the hot season, running for air conditionning.



They sell you a sandwich, among other stuff, Banh mi style, but you're being charged twice too much for what you receive, so little meat with fresh garnish (carrots, salad, coriander, etc...). You mostly taste the garnish but almost to none of the meat, just enough to know it's there. Nowadays, it's a common custom with Banh Mi sandwich, and vietnamese places, to let you down with the meat. They, then, try to grill your sandwich inside a small small-oven-grill but it comes out still as white as it was before.



You also have the combo pack with a small soup, which is also letting you down with the taste. It's mostly generic style then caracterized, as it should be in the typical vietnamese cooking. You leave with 8,75 $ less in your pocket as it should be worth only 5,95 $.



If your order is made ""to go"", they forget to put ustensils in your bag, but the bag has at its bottom a small napkin, just in case. Service is slim to none, less then ordinary, they want you to leave fast.

ts191,1/12/2012,revtest1998,2,"I was SO excited about this location opening up so close to where I live, as I practically grew up on Chipotle (starting back in 2000 in San Diego). My first opportunity, I made an order online and picked-up on my way to class. However, I was a little let down.



First, my online order was not ready at the designated time, despite it not being busy. Someone just dropped the ball. Oh well, slightly annoying, but forgivable as there was no one else in line and I could oversee the construction of my bowl.



The fajita mix (peppers and onions) looked a little old and over-cooked. It happens sometimes and I figured that I just got there after a lull. No biggie. 



When it came time to leave, there was confusion about how to use the system, as it was a pre-paid online order. It took about a minute to clear up, but was thinking that for a brand-new location the staff should be better trained. Still, I calmed myself and ran through my imaginative happy place where Chipotle guacamole runs in rivers and their salty-lemony chips grow on trees.



However, the the final let down arrived when I started eating the barbacoa bowl. The barbacoa was rather dry and clumped together--immune to even repeated stabbings and twistings with a fork. Nothing could de-tangle it. I had to eat it more like meat on a stick style, which was actually a  little bit of a turn off and made for a unsatisfied Chipotle experience.



Put together, I was let down. I was expecting more for a brand new location. Perhaps the staff needs more time to get into the groove of things and maybe Chipotle should step up their training program a bit too.



I'll be back again soon to see how things have progressed, but please don't let me down again! My heart (and stomach) just couldn't handle it.",negative

They had no chips or guac and the remaining rice was hard and undercooked. Maybe it's fine in the middle of the day but everyone working here was more concerned with closing procedures than dealing with the lengthening line. Again I would have understood if I came in 3 mins before closing, but I was handed my burrito in a to go bag and the hint was definitely to get out!",negative

The more I have visited Chipotle over the years the more I realize how lazy they have gotten with their one-item menu. There meat and salsa have become so bland you're almost better cooking your own at home with some marinade.



Many competitors have popped up over the years that are not Mexican food joints but direct ""burrito only"" type competitors and have given Chopotle a run for their money. While I don't see them going out of business any time soon, they sure need to get their act together. With the recent reveal of almost an entire GMO menu, I have one more reason besides flavor to never return.

When i first walked in I thought : GENERIC Bennigans. Those of you old enough to remember Bennigans restaurants will understand.



THE SERVICE



Sara our server was good. She was very polite and genuine. I appreciated her service. She was the only bright spot.



THE FOOD 



GENERIC, lower quality,  I completely understand that the franchisees in these types of business have zero to next to zero input as far as suppliers and food quality. They are buying a cookie cutter type operation with brand standards and operations set in stone. It takes an act of congress to create any real substantial change. This is NOT a reflection of the franchisee who I do not know. The food was lower quality product to start with so how much can they really do with it. The presentation was ho hum at best.  I can not stress enough the GENERICness of the food. The food was a total dissapointment.



THE AMBIENCE



Misses totally ! A trip to Wal-Mart and you could buy 90% of the decor. Unimaginitive and showed lack of any substantial design other then put it on the wall and it will be a sports bar. Pictures, jerseys, pennants, and TVs do not make an environment. It felt empty and hollow.

I got the fish and chips based on the server's obvious excitement when I asked about them but when it came out, about 20 minutes later the three pieces were sitting on the ""chips"" (fries) so they were extremely soggy and grease filled.  When I brought it to the attention of the server her remark was ""yeah, that happens.""   I must have looked dumb founded because I wasn't sure how to respond so she just walked away.

Unfortunately our visit to the Beef O'Brady's in Surprise was a sad disappointment.  Both meals that were ordered included the beef.  It was not only clearly evident that frozen patties were used, but there was also the taste of freezer burn and staleness.  In other words the patty melt and hamburger we had pretty much sucked.  I can't really say anything to incredibly positive about the french fries and ranch dressing.

The fish was bland and did not have a crunchy or crisp coating. When she ordered she specifically asked for extra crispy. She even asked the server to take it back to the kitchen to make it crispier but the server returned telling her the cook refused and said that's as crispy as it's gonna get.

This review is for the Asian/American cafe that is located inside of the casino. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but sometimes, it just needs to happen (if you don't believe me, go in this place and check it out).



I personally thought that we have moved past this type of food. Maybe like 20 years ago this might have been accepted as mediocre food, but now, I,Don't, Think, So!



I was thinking about giving this place 2 stars because the cashier lady was so friendly. And, she seemed genuinely concerned about making sure that I was alright. But, the food was speaking loudly too me, it was actually SHOUTING at me! So, here we go...



5$ Pho: Ok, lets talk about the broth. I'm talking Top Ramen here peeps. Like, water + powdered soup base. That's it. Mental picture here. Noodles: Pad Thai noodles. It looks like they weren't soaked and cooked properly, or possibly they were old because they had that slight woody taste.. The rare beef? Overcooked, well done (meaning past medium)  thick slices of flavorless beef. Finally, cilantro on top. That's all folks. Plus, i've had a tender stomach last night and the whole day today.



The owners seemed very nice so it pains me to do this. But I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I've been very fortunate to hit a lot of bullseye's in my foodie quest in Vegas. I've also hit some ducks along the way. Quack muthatruckin' Quack!",negative

ts198,10/5/2012,revtest2041,2,"With the exception of very friendly employees, Cafe Zupas fails in pretty much every category I can think of.  It's the cheap Paradise Bakery.  If you've read any of my Paradise Bakery reviews, you'd know that's not a compliment by any means.  Whomever dreamed up the concept of this quick service restaurant really didn't think things through.



The counter is a complete cluster.  There are monitors with videos playing that blocks the menu board.  So if you don't know what you want, you need to grab a paper menu.  Pretty awkward for a first timer.  Standing in a big group of people steering at menus also was an unexpected and uncomfortable experience.   I then ordered my sandwich and a salad at the left end of the counter, navigated my way around the people waiting for soups, past the dessert counter (desserts actually looked awesome, so I'd bet they were not made on sight), then to the registers.  Retold the order I just made but was still waiting on to the cashier.  Then I had a brief wait for my food at the register.  I usually am not a big fan of the take a number system.  But that would be very helpful at this place.  Also, some sort of a ticket to hand the cashier or a register at the same place you order would be nice as well.



The food wasn't very good.  The summer chicken salad was short on toppings.  Plenty of lettuce, a decent amount of fruit, but only a few pieces of chicken. The french bread from any nearby supermarket would have been tastier than what they offered on the side.  The chicken pesto panini wasn't very flavorful or filling.  While the entrees are cheap, you're going to have to shell out for the sides if you want a complete meal.

I work at an office building a block away with 450 employees, which most would go to zupas for lunch.

So got a group of my co-workers to go for a ""healthy"" lunch. Many of us ordered the combo - which I thought was a half sandwich and a cup of soup - like it is at most places. Instead, it was a whole sandwich and bowl of soup. So much for the healthier smaller portions. Soups were salty. Thai lobster curry did not have a shred of lobster meat in it. Lunch meats used in the sandwiches were cheap and relatively tasteless. One in our group got a salad that ""tasted like fish"" but contained no seafood. They happily exchanged it, though.



But the thing that really chapped my butt was a salesperson who approached our table mid-meal and tried to sell us Silpada jewelry and have us book a party. Apparently, management at this establishment allows that to happen, as she and another salesperson had set up their ""home base"" at a table at the front of the store, with catalogs and gift bags. Let me assure you, when I am out lunching with co-workers under a time limit, I am there to enjoy their company. The last thing I want is to be accosted by a sales presentation! I tried to complain through Zupa's website, but they have no Contact link there for message. Wonder why?

We ordered a chicken panini (in which they got it wrong and used ham) a soup which was so salty that it was inedible and finally a salad which came complete with a long blonde hair of one of the workers (we both have black hair).

When they made the soup they were confused on the half sized bowl and had to be told that the half size comes with their half and half special. Thirdly when asked to sample the soup, they gave a cup of nothing but broth and replied they are not allowed to give anything else. Fourthly the toppings on the salads are minimal. And lastly, they had to be reminded about the strawberry and bread that comes with the meal.

I said that was dumb, it doesn't say select two different items, the sign says choose two.  I was then told it was ""corporate policy.""  Really?

Rather than handling the situation in a customer friendly way, they gave me a tough sh*t attitude, refused to give me the corporate number, and were very rude over all.

I still could not figure out what kind of ""coach"" she was talking about.  I asked to speak to her manager and was told her ""coach"" was the manager and that I would need to call her after 8pm because she was busy.  I reminded the person behind the counter that I too was busy and did not like having to come down to the store again because an earring from someone's body was found in my food.  



I contacted the ""coach"" after 8PM and was told that she would open a claim into the incident.  I asked for a refund for our food and the woman told me that she would not give me my money back.

I contacted the Health District. I have also been in contact with the insurance company regarding the investigation. This incident is ongoing.

ts203,10/18/2012,revtest2070,2,"I am a big fan of Sardine (my go-to date night restaurant) and Marigold (who doesn't want a chili poached egg for breakfast?), so in my world having G&B move into the neighborhood felt like an early Christmas present. I would drive by and imagine being able to walk home after dinner with my roommate. My roommate and I would talk about our new favorite restaurant, as if it were already open and we were regulars. We were friends with the imaginary bartenders who worked there. I tried to convince my boyfriend's niece to apply for a job there. I was excited. Really. 



First Attempt:

Gates & Brovi apparently aspires to the family friendly sports bar vibe. Great. Perfect style for the neighborhood. I am there with 2 friends. We are excited! 



Here's the problem: the menu is dumbed down to the point that not one, but both dinner companions picked up the menu, skimmed, flipped it over (to reveal no flipside), and said 'Did they give us the kid's menu?' Both. Same line. 



Appetizers are almost universally fried and include items easily accessible in the frozen foods section at Copps. Lovely. Wow, ranch dressing for dip? How innovative. Burgers and sandwiches--again, I can make these options (really) at home. On a weeknight. For children who would actually eat them because there are no 'weird' ingredients (Like vegetables. Or creative sauces. Or creative toppings. Or creativity, full stop). Option to add 'weird' ingredients? No. I understand that this is a family oriented restaurant, but there are burger and sandwich joints less than a mile away (ahem...Laurel, V, Jac's) that serve kid friendly food without the condescension of this menu. If this restaurant were unrelated to Sardine and Marigold, it would be a disappointment. As it stands, it's offensive.



Moving on...We order one of two non-fried appetizers on the menu-- crab dip with veggies. Comes in a shallow, wide metal dish which, go figure with the dish selection, was instantly lukewarm and congealed. Veggies were 3 carrot sticks and 3 celery sticks, cut so thin they curled. Looks of dismay were exchanged. These are the same owners who serve the lovely fritto and chicken liver crostini, no? Surely they can identify an appropriate serving utensil and cut the veggies thick enough to hold shape. We also tried the shrimp fritters-- if fry is the primary menu option, embrace it, no? Meh. Not bad, not great...the point is, not memorable.



At this same meal, drinks are ordered. Drinks menu? No. Beers on tap? Couldn't hear the waitress (oh wait, this is the one thing G&B has in common with Sardine and Marigold-- exceptionally poor acoustics). Is there at least a list of the tap and bottle beer? Don't have one, ""but we have pretty much anything you can think of by the bottle"". Great. Could my friend have a Crispin? ""We don't have that"". Ah. At this point we ordered a round a Spotted Cow (state beverage, apparently), gave up on the limp veggies and cold crab dip and half eaten shrimp fritters, and declared a hiatus. Surely the restaurant will improve, we thought. 



Second Attempt:

Cut to 10 days later. Brainwave! It's a kid restaurant-- I'll bring a kid! I just had a bad attitude! It's going to be awesome! 



Have they now written a beverage menu? Not yet. Boyfriend and kid (aka focus group of one) pick up food menus, turn them over, look confused, and simultaneously say, ""Is this it?"". No, I did not prep them. Back to the lousy acoustics. Two ""whatever that first one you said""s are ordered along with a root beer float and cheese curds. Root beer float arrives with a bottle of root beer and purple silly straw-- lovely. I was wrong. G&B is redeemed. 



Wait...is that a puddle of grease at the bottom of those curds? And why are they all stuck together? Darn it! But no, I will stay positive. Burgers are ordered-- this is a burger joint, their burgers are going to be inspired in their simple perfection!  All will be forgiven! Oh...they don't come with a side? A Dixie cup of coleslaw? Okay! Sounds great! $10.50 for a burger and side of small fries! Grilled onions? Yum! Oh wait, you put raw onions on instead. Special sauce? Couldn't find it. Was it that penny-sized dot on the bottom of the bun? I can't say if it was 'special'. I couldn't taste it (see previous onion issue). Gooey melty cheese....so passé. Apparently the new way to serve burgers is with cold, unmelted cheese squares. Mmmmm. 



Kid verdict? Float finished, half a burger left uneaten. This is a teenage boy. The focus group has spoken.



Adult verdict? I hate you for getting me so excited, for so many months, with my fantasies about my 'new favorite restaurant' (within walking distance!), and for then being awful. I hate you for being related to Marigold and Sardine and for making me expect more from you. Ugh.



I give you two stars. One for the root beer-- the straw was cool (plus no-one got food poisoning, so hey, that's something). One for the awesome skeleton lawn flamingo I got next door at Mallatt's.",negative
ts203,11/10/2012,revtest2071,2,"Much of my criticism and compliments have already been detailed very nicely by others, so I will just summarize in bullet points.



1. Great location for walkers, inconvenient for those driving from other neighborhoods. Given that it is geared toward the neighborhood and repeat customer base... (see number 2)

2. Very limited menu selection. Literally turned the menu over to see what was on the back, only to find it empty, thought to myself, 'is this a kids' menu?' Turns out that is what everyone at the table was thinking too.

3. In response to my request for a drink list, our server replied, ""We have every beer you can think of in bottle."" False. Who wants to play the game, ""Do you have {insert beer}"" repeatedly in a noisy crowded restaurant? Write it down or memorize it and be able to tell me all of them.

4. A basket of individually wrapped saltine crackers like one would find at a salad bar is NOT an acceptable bread item to serve with hot crab dip. Just cut the carrots and celery into adult human size, give enough of them, and/or add some nice crostini.

5. The clam chowder is very good.

6. The shrimp fritters are pretty good.



I am interested to see if the owners read their own reviews and improve the quality of food and service. It really is a great location, and I so eagerly awaited their opening.",negative
ts203,11/30/2012,revtest2072,2,"This restaurant confused me.  The coastal meets northwoods atmosphere was cozy and I would have perceived the restaurant to be fairly upscale, but the little details caused it to look pretty cheap.  Appetizers and sandwiches came in red plastic baskets and coleslaw came in leaky paper cups - I'd expect as much at a bbq joint, but not at a restaurant on Monroe Street.  French fries are an extra charge (I think $2); which is acceptable if they're good fries, and these were not (dry, crispy, overcooked, sad little fries).



There was a lack of sandwich/burger options on Monroe Street (still is IMO after eating here), but definitely not a shortage in Madison - better sammies and burgers can be had elsewhere.",negative
ts203,12/17/2012,revtest2073,2,"There seems to be a cycle in new Madison restaurants lately: 



1. Open your doors,

2. Bring in guests on the novelty factor,

3. Fail to offer a clean vision of what you're trying to do, 

4. Stay afloat for a year or so, perhaps on strength outside your food,

5. Bring in a new executive chef,

6. Success in all things!



Gates & Brovi seems to be around steps 2 or 3 in the cycle. Given that they're run by the same folks who bring us such delight at Sardine, I'm confused at what they're trying to accomplish out Nakoma way.



Is the ""date night"" full lobster dinner also going to come in a red plastic basket? Does my melted butter come in a small paper cup?



For a restaurant with all the trappings of a barbecue joint (the baskets, the low end paper napkins which might as well be wrapping plasticware, the poor selection of non-beer drinks) there's only a faint nod towards BBQ in the form of a roasted pork sandwich. 



I'm not really sure what G&B is trying for. Perhaps they want to be a simple neighborhood joint, and I just don't live in the neighborhood. Maybe it didn't help that my first attempt to go was at the end of a lovely stroll on a Monday evening only to be unpleasantly surprised that they were closed. [Which is a thing that restaurants can do, food service can have their own weekend, but there's either a certain level of cuisine or a Mom and Pop behind the counter. G&B meets neither of these.]



Neither my sandwich nor my friend's was memorable. The waitress seemed easily confused by our requests, and pretty much vanished at several points.

It looks nice from the outside. The space inside was very open, high ceilings, lots of light from the windows. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful.

 

However:

The parking situation is a nightmare. No parking lot. If you go at about 5:00-5:30 like we did, good luck. We had to park 2 blocks away. It is mind-boggling to me that the city zoning board would approve this place without parking.



Then there is the food. I ordered New England Clam Chowder. Well, there were clams, but the broth was thin, and there were all these vegetables that made it taste more like minestrone. Why would somebody do this? Reminds me of people who make guacamole with about three cloves of garlic and bury any avocado taste.

So then I ordered their slow-roasted roast beef sandwich. Same kind of deal, there was so much other stuff in there I was not sure I wasn't eating a Muffaletta sandwich. If I wanted that I would not have ordered roast beef.

We were at happy hour early (3:30) and our first waitperson was great, but after she left, it was clear to me that while the guys -- who were obviously buddies with one of the bartenders -- were waited on constantly, chatted with etc -- we were not worth the time. Yet we were the only people ordering food, expressing an interest in the menu, and drinking actual cocktails not covered by happy hour.  



I at first thought these other customers got lavish attention because they were men but my husband commented he was timing his empty glass, it was over 20 minutes, and we received food without a check in on his drink.  



There were three bartenders with time on their hands. Empty glasses.  And really worst of all, no interest in our questions and engagement in the menu.

I do not want to give an unfavorable review after only one visit. Truthfully, I cannot even recall what I ate. I just remember that no one at the table was thrilled with their food. We walked away full but the food was totally forgettable. The first visit was at night, the place was bustling. We had good service despite the crowd.



A few days ago I visited Gates and Brovi at lunch time. It was a business meeting of sorts but my friend and I agreed that we would not bring our paperwork into the restaurant as not to ""hog"" a table during the busy lunch hour. It turned out we had nothing to worry about. We were at the restaurant for a couple of hours and there were many tables available during our stay.



I had the shrimp salad sandwich and my friend had the eggplant sandwich. I thought the dressing on the shrimp was extremely thin and tasteless. The shrimp were small and probably had been frozen. The bread became soggy and there was  a sad little lettuce leaf for some desperately needed crunch. I ate the sandwich with a fork.



The eggplant sandwich looked very appealing. It was a pretty plate of food. However, my friend stated that the sandwich was terribly under-spiced and just bland in general. 



So, I do not plan to return until I hear that changes have been made. The menu is very small and not many of the items drew my attention. I cannot believe that the restaurant is run by the same folks who own Sardine and Marigold. Both restaurants have consistently excellent food and a great vibe to go with it.

Finally, the food arrived -- cold. The waitress didn't have any idea who ordered what, which was confusing for everyone. Some things delivered, some taken back, some given to the wrong person. Two orders were missing. 



The others ate while we waited for the missing meals. Finally, everyone was finished, and one missing order was delivered. The other never arrived. ""Don't worry,"" said the waitress, ""I removed the other hamburger from your bill."" But upon inspection it wasn't, and we had to have that fixed. 



Simply ridiculous. A disaster.



Even if it had arrived hot, the food was bland. The burgers, the calamari, the beet salad, the BLT, the three chicken tenders (for $8) -- all were unremarkable, yet very expensive. The selection of tap beer was poor too.

The restaurant was clean as it was still showing the Grand Opening sign out front.  The buffet options was not very impressive.  They had veg. pakora (cold) and no samosa's.  Their meat options were Chicken Tikka Masala which was very dissapointing.  It was a tomato base with absolutely no spices.  It could have used some garam masala and some ginger and other indian spices.  It tasted like tikka masala out of a jar.  It just did not give you a sense of any effort was made.  The tandoori chicken was also bland with absolutely no flavor.  Again, where is the Indian spices?  The vegetable dishes were saag paneer and dahl fry which were both ok, but no Aloo Gobi??  I have to admit the basmati rice and garlic naan were the best thing there.  Another big disappointment was the Gulab Jamun dessert which was ice cold.

Maybe it was my fault for ordering veggie korma since the version at my favorite place, Royal Taj, is sublime. I knew Indian Gate wouldn't be able to outdo them, but the lackluster version that I had tonight really missed the mark. Korma is supposed to be creamy, buttery, and yellow. This was more like a tomato-based veggie stew. I really disliked the presence of zucchini and whole cashews in the dish, but it was edible when paired with the not-so-garlicky garlic naan.

We stopped to get a couple quick take out sandwiches. The guy taking the order was super cool and made a good first impression. 



Once the order was placed, he bagged up another delivery order, delivered it, and came back before they were done making our first sandwich. 



It was every bit of 30 minutes. And, most annoying, they didn't even act like they were busy! One guy fumbled with a salad lid for like 10 minutes...bewildered as if he had never seen one before! I wanted to snatch it out of his hand and show him that he was obviously trying to put it on upside down! He even grabbed another as if a new one would somehow go on upside down. He wrapped the salad and side of dressing in plastic to prevent leaks. Nice thought but also VERY time consuming. 



The other sandwich girl wasn't taking a hint either. The guy in front of me told her he was hung over, didn't care what was on the sandwich, didn't want to answer questions and asked her to just make the sandwich they way she wanted (in other words, hurry the F up!).

At its core, Cheba Hut offers unique and quite tasty sandwiches at an appropriate price. The Magic Mushroom sandwich with the works is probably the best vegetarian sandwich available via delivery in Madison, and I've heard The Kind is also super solid.



That being said, it is so disappointing to have a would've-been-amazing meal ruined by the worst customer service the fast food industry has to offer. My in-store experience was mediocre at best, my food having taken fifteen minutes in a line of two sandwiches. Employees aren't helpful, and don't seem to know what they're responsible for. It generally seems disorganized.



When you order for delivery, your sandwich might arrive in an hour fifteen (if it arrives at all, because this store doesn't seem to honor every order, based on whether or not they feel like making and delivering it -- seriously) wrapped in aluminum foil, soggy because of poor packaging and cold because it sat around fully dressed before someone felt like delivering it.

ts207,3/23/2013,revtest2094,1,"I really wanted to like this place since my first experience at Centurion was so good. Unfortunately after two attempts here, I've given up. 

The first attempt at eating at the bar came last Sunday. We stopped in around 1 pm looking for a sandwich. After being seated, they inform us that only the brunch menu is available. OK, but by brunch menu they mean breakfast. There are no typical lunch items available. No problem, so we place our order for the Wisconsin scones. A few minutes later the waiter returned to inform us that they're out of hamburger meat. At this point, nothing else on the menu looks appetizing, so we leave.  I think, no big deal, this happens now and again.



We decide to return the following Saturday and meet a friend for brunch. This time full well knowing that means breakfast only. We sit down and all order a bloody mary. As the waitress is walking away, she turns around to inform is that they are out of scones. Out of scones??? That removes 1/3 of their menu. I'm in disbelief that this happened again, but really wanting to like this place we just decide to look for other options on the menu. Then the waitress returns again and informs us that they're out of bloody mary mix.  That was it for us. As much as I wanted like this place, that kind of management is inexcusable.

I have been to this bar three times now; and they have a decent selection and food is pretty good but the last two times I've been in it has been the worst service I may have ever received.

The first time I went in I was served by a very nice lady who was tentative and professional. This is apparently not the standard.

The second time I went the bartender, I believe his name was Kyle, had a group of friends at the bar nursing waters. It took a couple minutes for the bartender to show up; I had to wait for him and his friends to finish their conversation (more on that later). The first wine I asked for was a cote du Rhine which should be fairly light. Instead he gave me a Spanish blend saying it would be close. It wasn't. I later realized that he had sold me the most expensive glass on the menu. When I was finished with it I decided to switch wines to something closer to what I wanted in the first place. To get the bartender's attention I should've had some road flares. He was so engrossed in his friends that I literally had to wave at him, I'm also the only other guest in the whole place. All that said, the conversation I had to listen to was.. Less than professional.. The bartender not only divulged his sexual orientation but then went further to explain preferences.

I ordered the second glass and when I did the bartender asked me if I wanted a new glass, fairly astounded at this point I said its up to you I guess. He brought the wine and while pouring it he told me he wasn't getting me a fresh glass because he hated polishing glasses. When I asked for a third glass he had became so lazy that he had his friends deliver it to me so he wouldn't have to walk around the bar.



After such an experience I gave it a solid couple of months before trying it again, but I must be a massochist. I waited until it was a new bartender from the previous and once again the man behind the bar was much more interested in his coworkers than I, the paying guest.

ts208,7/14/2013,revtest2099,2,"We were sorely disappointed by this spot, but for reasons that could be easily fixed.  First, the location and decor are beautiful--classy, elegant, and relaxed.  Onto the issues:



1.  Service was spotty.  On a recent Thursday evening, our server was nonexistent for much of our dinner.  For example, our bottle of wine sat on the table for more than 10 minutes until he walked by (finally) and realized that he forgot to open it.  I would have, of course, said something sooner had we been able to find him.



2.  Despite our request to have the tapas ordered in a particular way, nothing came out from the kitchen with any logic or sequence.  So a meaty appetizer came out before a salad, which was then followed by the soup--not the way we requested it at all.



3.  The food itself was very mixed.  The Mediterranean salad was creamy, because it suffered from too much cheese.  The bruschetta were perfect, so no complaints there.  But the gazpacho was extremely bland and lacked any evidence of seasoning.  The tomatoes tasted as if they had come straight from a food processor with no spicing at all.  Just cold pureed tomatoes--not the spirit of gazpacho at all.  



Worse yet were the braised bison ribs, which the server described as done in an ""amazing"" cola sauce.  I've braised ribs and pork in coke numerous times.  The flavor should be slightly sweet and deep.  These were super-sweet and bland at the same time.  Once again, the food lacked any seasoning whatsoever. Disappointing.



With a bit more attention to these culinary details, this spot could be excellent.",negative
ts209,5/18/2013,revtest2100,2,"Had a reservation yet had to wait 30 min for our table, then once sat 45 min for drinks, food came out before drinks. Small plates but the menu did not state that was expecting full portion.",negative
ts209,7/16/2013,revtest2101,1,"Tender is a gorgeous space that is well-decorated, with well-meaning waitstaff. However, the rest of the experience is a disaster. Where to start with the issues at this bar/restaurant/whatever:



1. The bizarre rules. Tender is seated mainly by reservations, yet people who place them routinely still wait for tables. And you can't have a drink at the bar because there is no standing at the bar. I can't think of a better way to encourage people to leave a place! The main space is beautiful, but the back rooms are small & cramped, and it's unclear what purpose the equally dungeon-esque downstairs rooms could serve. 



2. The waitstaff/bartenders: All of them are well-meaning, if a bit pretentious, but that's fine. What's hard to accept is that no one seems to know what is going on. Simply asking what beers are on draft produces a flurry of activity that still doesn't result in a simple list. This is probably in part due to the aesthetic decision to have silver tap handles without the descriptive beer handles; this is fine if the staff is briefed on what beers are on tap, but not so good when they are not. Different waitresses and hostesses are constantly coming up asking different questions; the whole thing is not what you would expect from a fine dining restaurant.



3. The cocktails: they range from okay to great. Again, this is fine, but not what you would expect from a restaurant priding itself on its cocktails. Also, an attempt to order off the menu can end badly: I tried to order a Brooklyn cocktail only to have the waitress check, say it was okay, take my order, and then come back and say that they didn't have the ingredients. A prohibition-era bar doesn't have Rye, Vermouth, Bitters, Maraschino, and some kind of digestif?



4. The food. When I first ate at Tender, right after they opened, I would say that, based on the price vs quantity of food, Tender is by far the most expensive restaurant in Pittsburgh. Portions were shockingly small and shockingly expensive. Plus, there was nothing of great expense or difficulty to prepare on the plates. To be fair, I know they've revamped their menu, so maybe they've addressed this issue.



In short, Tender feels like a bar run by someone who likes restaurants, not a restauranteur. Everything is flash and sizzle, but no substance.",negative

The interior is unique and it is a bar I'm sure that is worth a visit once but the hours they list are deceptive.,negative
ts209,8/20/2013,revtest2103,2,"I stopped by here this past Friday evening with my fiance and two other dining companions.  We had made reservations earlier in the week and arrived at the restaurant right around the time of our reservations and were immediately seated.  The hostess took us through a cool looking bar area and into a back room that had two tables for 4 and a lounge area.  It was a pretty cool space and the lounge area looked like it could fit right into the Mad Men TV show or maybe even a bit earlier.  



As we sat down, we were given our menus.  Since it was Pittsburgh Restaurant week they had a special going where you could get an appetizer, entree and dessert for $25 and gave three options for each.  Beyond that, I can't really say that there was much of a menu besides a bar snacks section which left me disappointed.  Long before we got there our dining companions had let us know that they would be about 15 minutes later than our reservation for dinner.  As such I decided to order from the bar snacks portion while we waited for them and so we started off with the popcorn which that night ended up being a dill covered popcorn.  It ended up being really good with a decent amount of butter on it and a generous serving of dill.  For dinner I decided to have the spicy chicken as my appetizer, a pasta as my entree and then a vegan gingersnap ice cream sandwich filled with peaches and cream ice cream.  One of my dining companions asked how the ice cream was vegan and I believe that they replied that it was made with tofu instead of diary.  My meal started off well as the spicy chicken had a good spice level to it.  It was actually much spicier than I had been expecting but that is a good thing to for me as I love my food to be spicy.  Next up was the pasta which was quite a disappointment.  There was barely any sauce on it I honestly could not taste any of the flavors that they had on the menu.  Normally I like just about everything that I eat but I don't care for wasting calories on something that is bland and doesn't taste like much.  Finally I had the dessert.  It was, well interesting may be the best word.  Whenever it came out to us the ice cream was melting which was fine and I dove right into it.  The taste was not that great although not bad either and I wish that I could describe it but I don't know that I have ever had anything comparable to it.  At least the ginger snaps were good as they were a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.



The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back to Tender in the future.  I honestly can't say that the food was terrible, but it wasn't nearly worth the money that we spent on it.  Beyond that their menu was very limited and if they had posted the actual menu that they were serving on the restaurant week website instead of a sample one from which they were only minor similarities, I do not believe that we would have gone there.

Next went to the pasta.  I had the Bolognese and while it wasn't bad, the meat was definitely an American version of a real Bolognese blend.  The papparadelle a pomodoro was average at best.  Again the sauce lacked finesse.  Unfortunately, I must say the same for the tiramisu.  We have had such good tirami su of late at Andreoli, Pomo and Trattoria Veneto.  The tiramisu here simply lacked flavor.

The food wasn't good either.  Had some appetizer with an egg and asparagus.  I can't even find it on the menu now to give the name.  It was actually icky and a small portion.  If I was starving when it arrived I wouldn't have even ate it.  Left a taste in my mouth that I didn't like.   Husband tried the flat iron steak.  I didn't think it was good at all.  He is less picky and ate his food happily.  I had some dish that looked like pot roast (also can't find on the menu now).  It was recommended to me by the waiter and I didn't care at all for it.

ts211,9/29/2014,revtest2123,1,"SOLO has turned from a friendly, family-owned establishment, to a cheap, penny-pinching ""why-did-I-ever-think-this-place-was-decent"" restaurant.

Long story short: we had a Groupon for a dinner for two (appetizer, dinner, dessert). We've been here before with a Groupon or LivingSocial or Amazon Deals (get the point? They're desperate for business). The Groupon happened to expire on a Sunday. This business is closed on Sundays. I didn't realize that because I often use Groupons ON the expiration date without a problem. Let's be honest: we all have lives, and sometimes time runs out on us. 

The point is this - it's NOT a coupon. It's a GROUPON - something I paid for. If a COUPON expired on a date the business was closed, tough. A Groupon is different and should be treated differently. It's no more my fault it expired on a day they were closed than it is their fault they were closed. Further, nothing on the Groupon said the business was closed on Sunday, it's just how it happened.

After two phone calls and an email conversation with the owners, they refused to honor the Groupon the day after it expired (when they were OPEN!). Groupon happened to be running the exact same deal at the time my Groupon expired. They gave me some B.S. excuse and Groupon ended up refunding my credit card because these cheapskates were so unreasonable - and I was right.

Tip: don't go here without an online deal (they are literally everywhere, so you won't have to look hard).

I, for one, will never dine here again, and I wish them the level of success they deserve (you can imagine what my thoughts are). Arrivederci! Speaking of Arrivederci, they have good food, and they aren't jerks.",negative

Then he brought me my salad with ""balsamic vinaigrette"" which only consisted of just balsamic and oil and it was completely separated. The pizza was decent but it lacked in sauce. I just felt that for the price, and the fact it was an Italian restaurant, their bruschetta and pizza should have been way better. And If they are going to add jam and meat to the bruschetta and take out the tomatoes, it should be noted on the menu or the waiter should notify me.

Sadly, this restaurant isn't even on my ""I'll just get the food because I like it and expect the service to suck"" lists. Not even worth it. I called in an order to go and I was told 15 minutes or less. I arrive around 15 minutes later when it should be ready and the girl at the counter 1. Didn't acknowledge me, 2. Was in the way of everyone else who was busy doing their jobs 3. Was preoccupied with standing at the counter texting on her cell phone. I mean, really? I'm actually surprised none of the other employees told her to get off the phone and work because I could tell they were having to pick up some of her slack. I finally get her attention and say that I have an order for pick up and she says ""you'll need to wait."" Just like that, with a bad attitude and an extremely unwelcoming facial expression at that. So I take a seat next to the counter to wait. Mind you the place isn't busy. There's one couple waiting for a booth to open but there were many places to be seated. After waiting for about 10 minutes I stand up next to the counter and again, not acknowledged. I ask her if she could check to see if my order was ready (she didn't even ask my name when I originally arrived) and STILL texting on her phone says to herself ""oh I didn't check you out."" A woman who seemed to be the manager asks me what I ordered, told me it was ready and gave my bag of food to the cashier. As I was grabbing my money she got back on her phone texting AGAIN. Her being young and society's technology is no excuse. I can't believe she wasn't coached on proper customer service etiquette and extremely surprised that the management staff allows you to be on your phone while dealing with customers.

She and the manager even apologized for that.  But, everyone is new to a job at least once and, as a former restaurant worker, I tend to be quite forgiving.  Whenever I go to a new ""ethnic"" restaurant I usually order one of the ""baseline dishes,"" because if these dishes are good the rest of the menu items are also usually good.   Here I did a taco and a cheese enchilada combo.  First, I couldn't get ground beef even though the waitress told me ground beef was an option, instead I got big chucks of shredded beef in the taco.  The pieces were dry and tough, so as I bit into the taco shell I ended up with a huge hunk of beef hanging out of my mouth with a little piece of shell.  Not at all good.  Most disappointing, though, was the complete lack of ""zing"" in any of the food I had.  Everything was bland, bland, bland, even the salsas served at the beginning of the meal were lackluster!  I could not taste any cilantro or jalapeno in anything!  Mexican food is supposed to have a little kick in it, but not here.  Even Taco Bell has more spice and flavor than Gecko Grill.  My wife ordered a Seafood Grande with the sauce on the side as she is extremely sensitive to any level of spicy food.  Turned out there was no sauce in this dish but the burro was covered with melted pepperjack cheese because that's too hot for her.  She sent it back and ordered a shredded beef chimi.  The staff did get that out fairly rapidly.  While my wife liked this dish, she did admit that the chucks of shredded beef were very dry and not until she poured some of the liquidy bean dip on the meat was she satisfied with it.  I tasted some of the beef and it was very dry, just as in my taco.  Also, she got a little cup of salsa fresca with her chimi but thought it was more like pico de gallo.  I tasted it and it was so oniony that I actually spit it out into my napkin.  YUK!  The onions tasted as if they had been soaking in the pico de gallo for several days.

It wasn't even a Montreal style bagel! It tasted pasty. The cream cheese did not taste like cream cheese at all and was off putting. The salmon however was good. My friends had bacon with their meals, which I tried, and it was atrocious. It was plasticky to the point to which it was hard to eat. It didn't even taste like bacon. The hash browns tasted okay, but some of my friends potatoes were cold. One of my friends ordered banana crepes, but they forgot to include the bananas.  Also it took the wait staff at least half an hour to clear our plates off the table. The few good things about this pace were the coffee and friendly staff. All these problems may be due to the fact that this place is new, but these issues are pretty unforgivable. If they weren't ready to open, they shouldn't have opened.

These however were the typical bar nachos, small pile of chips, small amount of cheese, tons of beans etc. It is not that difficult to layer chips, cheese, more  chips, more cheese and then toppings. 



Mediocre food aside, I was feeling some coffee as I noticed the espresso machine. I asked the waitress what coffee drinks were really good, she said one and then just stood there. I'm a former barista so if I ask about your coffee I want to hear if you know what you're talking about. What's so great about the lion coffee they serve? I'll never know since I'm not planning on going back. 



Working in a restaurant I know you can get busy and forget things. However, I don't like to ask for a check and have you forget because a friend comes in and you're talking to them at the bar.

Clearly marketing to the tourists as there is a bar that opens to the street. Medium sized dining area. What put me off almost immediately is when I went to the website lunch specials were listed. However, when I went there the waitress new nothing about it and asked the manager, the manager then came over and explained that the lunch specials were only for the Henderson location and not downtown. I will own up that it was my mistake upon review of the website again when you download the menu it states Henderson menu and when you scroll down to the very bottom then there is a cover sheet stating Las Vegas menu that does not list lunch specials. Nonetheless, this left a bad taste in my mouth. 



As to the food, a bit pricey in my opinion for what you get. I will admit that I am a nacho snob - I love nachos and if I am going to splurge they better be darn good. I like traditional nachos piled high with gooey cheese (love the nachos at Big Dog's) and avant-garde nachos such as the asian nachos at Grand Luxe. The nachos sounded good, we ordered the cheeseburger nachos and bbq pulled pork nachos. The queso sauce was smooth and creamy and the pulled pork was sweet although not great bbq but I didn't expect that from here.  Cheeseburger nachos, well, were like a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, ground beef etc. They were approximately $10 each. They were good but again nothing phenomenal and for the price not a whole lot there. I was full but had I been any hungrier would not have been. And I am pretty sure other people in the group were not full. There were three plates of nachos shared among four people. 



They had one of those new help yourself Coke machines with the different flavors. Overall I have mixed feelings about the Coke machine. You have to get your own drink which I am okay with but if there is anyone standing at the drink machine you may be in for a long wait as they ponder their drink selection.

Classic tale of how bad service can ruin your entire experience.



I frequent the Nacho Daddy in the Henderson area, to the point where the servers pretty much know what I am having so I was eager to try the downtown location. I went in on a Saturday afternoon. The menu is completely different than the Henderson location, but they have an awesome happy hour and everything tasted good. I was with a party of four, and we decided to split our checks. I offered to pay for our appetizer, and didn't think too much when my check came in a little higher. When I got home later that night and cleaned by bag, I realized that I was charged for than double price for my entree. I called the next morning hoping that the problem could be corrected via phone. I was told that I had to physically go downtown, which is a hassle from Aliante. I asked for gas for the inconvenience. Anthony, the manager, proceeded to call me a liar among other things.. just completely unprofessional.



I was later allowed to come collect the difference. The server confirmed her mistake. The assistant manager was just as rude as Anthony, and not once did anyone offer an apology. 



I can say with great confidence, that I will never step foot in another Nacho Daddy. If you're in Henderson, check out Zabas or Chipotle nearby. Downtown there are plenty of substitutes that won't try to rip you off.",negative

It was some bland beef, bland fake cheese and a little real cheese on top of greasy chips.  Not sure how they can pride themselves on their nachos when I could get better ones from Taco Bell.

We ordered a pitcher of White Peach margaritas and the ""average burger"" nachos for me, Daddy's Supreme chicken taco for him.  Then we waited patiently, expecting the drinks to come out first.



No such luck - here comes the food.  I look over at my husband's plate and see this really sad-looking taco shell with a bunch of filling in it.  There was more plate than food, and I had a nasty feeling that the rest of the experience wasn't going to be much better than this.  My nachos, at least, had some substance.  But... they were just okay, not great.  The cheese sauce tasted like reheated Cheez Whiz, there was no bacon whatsoever to be found, and the onions were minced so finely that they just disintegrated the moment they touched my tongue.  I was bitterly disappointed.  



To make matters worse, the margaritas came when we were nearly done with our food.  Bad, bad timing.  We were pretty much ready to pack up and leave by that point.



Once the drinks came, the experience was slightly better - but, hey, I got drunk.  If it takes getting me drunk to improve things... (and my husband will tell you that he has never seen me tie one on like that, ever)



Final insult:  the bill was 53 dollars, making it the most expensive meal we had in Vegas over the course of a week.  It wasn't close to being worth that.  My husband honestly didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I convinced him otherwise.  



It never did get any busier while we were there.  I see why it didn't now.

Then I ordered the Vegan guacamole and mango salsa tacos.  I am sorry to say they were very unpleasant.  I am not sure if it is not ""mango season"" or what the deal is, but the ""guacamole"" was a misnomer--it was not full of guacamole like you might expect because there were no animal products-it just seemed like an afterthought.  My second problem with this place is that a diet soda is $2.95.  Come on, seriously?  you serve it in a little plastic cup.  Nothing fancy.  I will not be back here.

Angie.  Last night we returned to see if our service would be better than my previous trip as outlined below.

We brought a friend from BC for some food and drinks. Upon arrival there was a table on the patio with customers so we chose the opposite side after waiting a short time my wife went in and asked the Bartender if we could get service. Answer was yes. 23 minutes passed , no service so she went inside ordered 2 shots of Julio 42 and a Reposado.  Finally a server with Bunny ears came out and took our food order.

Really piss poor service.  I get it.  Downtown deals with tourists equals crappy service.  Hopefully your new store in Summerlin will care about and cater to locals.  Will give it one last try.  Thx Earle

We stopped in to check ND's out.  Heard about Nachos from watching it on the TV show Mystery Diners. Also a big sign out front advertising $5 tacos and $6 Titos 

We sat at the Bar and had a great time talking with him. The day we dined was National Taco Day as well as Vodka Day. Go figure. Tacos and Vodka.  With that said.  Nachos had $6 Titos cocktails. So we had street tacos and Titos 

Later that evening we decided to return with a friend for a cocktail. We ordered 3 Titos and service was really slow ""different bartender""  took forever to pay.

The service was ok. They were really friendly but it took a long time for us to get our food. 45 minutes to an hour which is quite long. 



I got chicken enchiladas which I typically get at the Henderson location but they were not good. The tortilla was too thick, the chicken wasn't even shredded, more of chunks and the flavor tasted like it came from a can. The rice was hard and nothing to be desired. 



Chips were good but you can't really mess that up. Waiting for our check took a while too. Clearly we were ready to go and our waiter walked passed us multiple times without a check in his hand. Finally after bringing it by it took another 10 minutes for him to come get it and the card to pay, despite 1/3 of our party standing up.

ts215,11/30/2014,revtest2172,2,"My biggest gripe here is the service. They need to get it together regardless of whether they're having a bad day or not. Literally everyone working walked around without a smile on their face. I'm not expecting a welcome choir when I come in, but at least look like you wanna do your job.

Our server was Debbie, I joined my party late and had to wait five minutes before leaving my table and going to the counter to get a menu. And then I waited another three minutes at the counter while two employees looked at me and kept moving. I stopped someone and asked if I place my order there or if my server does it for me, and as if my question inconvenienced him, he said my server would do it.

Then Debbie comes to the table and without saying ""hi, welcome to Nacho Daddy"" or ""hey, how's it going"" or even ""hi"", she says ""what can I get for you?"" She REALLY made me wanna pay 15 dollars for two tacos.

She brought me water but didn't bring me a place setting. It'd be one thing if it was busy, but she had two other tables.

And then when we asked someone else for the check, because 4 out of the 6 people had been done with their food for a while, the guy said, in a hurried tone, ""she's gonna get it, she's doing something right now.""

Even if Debbie was legitimately busy, there still wouldn't be an excuse for the wait time of things & her attitude on top of that added to the not-so-great experience.



I don't know how my group was acting before I showed up, but even if they were some what of a hassle because they took too long to order, or couldn't decide or were constantly talking over each other, you're still in the service industry and your job is to put up with it and you deal with it every day, so buck up and deal with it.

Leider war der Abend eine große Enttäuschung und zwar von Anfang bis Ende. Es fing mit dem Service an, zog sich über die Hauptspeise bis zum Dessert durch. Leider war auch das Theaterstück nicht gut, darauf gehe ich aber in einem Beitrag zur Badisch Bühn ein.

Ein Störfaktor war, dass man es einfach nicht hinbekam, für uns drei unsere Gänge einigermaßen gleichzeitig zu servieren. Wir hatten zwei mal Hirschragout und einmal Schnitzel mit Pommes. Da wir die Gemüsebeilage zum Hirsch nicht mochten fragte ich an, ob wir ein anderes Gemüse oder Salat haben könnten. Es kam dann ein anderes Gemüse UND Salat. Zuerst kamen die zwei Ragout und die waren auch schon fast gegessen bis endlich das Schnitzel kam. Leider war die Fleischqualität bei allen Essen nicht besonders gut, das Fleisch war zäh. Am Ragout war nicht wirklich eine Soße sondern das Fleisch war von einer zur Cremigkeit eingekochten Soße umhüllt. Das machte die Spätzle sehr trocken. Es waren viele bittere Pfefferkörner am Fleisch, die mir den Genuß ebenfalls verdarben. Das beigefügte Rotkraut war sehr ungewöhnlich gewürzt und schmeckte leicht süßlich und viel zu sehr nach Zimt. Der Beilagensalt war fad und ölig aber von der Mischung und Auswahl her gelungen. Ich aß dann auch gerade mal die Hälfte und als die Bedienung nachfragte, ob soweit alles ok sei, habe ich ehrlich geantwortet. Hier muss man positiv anmerken, dass sie sofort reagierte und eine Entschädigung in Form eines Schnäpschens oder Espresso anbot.

Ich entschied mich für einen Espresso, der auch wirklich lecker war. Aber auch hier ar nicht alles rund. Zum Espresso wurde ein riesiges Stück brauner Würfelzucker geliefert. Da saß ich vor meiner Tasse mit einem guten Schluck Espresso und einem Zuckerstück, dass so groß war, dass es nicht mal zur Hälfte darin versenkt werden konnte. Ich hatt die Wahl, Zucker eintunken und Teile abbröckeln lassen oder reinlegen, nicht umrühren und schnell trinken, damit der Kaffee nicht zu süß wird.

Wir wollten uns mit einem Dessert trösten und hatten gemischtes Eis, Apfelstrudel mit Vanillesoße und Ofenschlupfer. Leider wurden wir auch hier enttäuscht. Alles war sehr hübsch angerichtet und dekoriert aber Apfelstrudel und Ofenschlupfer schmeckten wie aufgetaut, einfach zäh. Das Eis hatte keine besondere Qualität und war viel zu süß. Und auch hier kamen die Desserts mit sehr viel Abstand, das letzte erst, nachdem die anderen gegessen hatten.

Fazit: Für die Preise ist das Niveau der Speisen zu niedrig und ich erwarte von einer Gaststätte, dass sie es hinbekommen, die Speisen bei 3 Personen einigermaßen gemeinsam zu servieren. schade",negative

First of all there were people ahead of us that were completely turned off by the fact that nobody greeted them or even tried to talk to them, (I really heard their complaints when they were leaving) even though there were two employees talking to each other minding their own business instead of helping people out.

We finally got seated and we got one of the worst and rude waitress (her name is Carito) who never made us feel welcome or explain the menu or at least smiled the entire night. On top of that I think the owner's wife was more concerned in Collecting the cover to watch the fight than to provide a good customer service to us, so we told her to add the $10.00 cover to our bill.

The food was OK but it would be a sin if you screw up nachos but what really pissed me off is that Carito tried to charge me $50.00 for an open bar (which is the cover for the fight and we only had to pay $10.00 for it) so I explained her that there was a problem with my bill so she tried to correct it.

The second time she tried to charge me $25.00 extra and of course I complaint; she came the third time and told me it was corrected and she asked me if I was going to pay in cash or credit card and she was rushing me to pay and of course I checked the bill and there was a $20.00 cover charge.

After the fourth try she made it right and my guess is that her and the rest of the  staff members try to charge extra thinking that people are stupid to ask or too drunk to care about their bill.

Now, the first reviewer on Yelp really raves over the service and warm staff, but I found neither to be true. They barely acknowledged us ---the chips were terribly stale and salsa bland. 

   Now , we placed our orders and we waited 45 minutes for the food to come---I had asked our server if something was wrong as it was 7:00pm and still no food. She said one of their cooks was not there that night and they were a bit behind. No dear, you were way behind ---when the food came out all the rice and bean sides were stone cold but the entrees were at least hot. We informed her of this and they brought out all  new (and hot) rice and bean. At no time did the server ask to refill my husband's ice tea ---that is just poor service. I do think the food is very good and high quality but the service and professionalism is sorely lacking. There have been at least four different restaurants located at this site--maybe some of you remember Glorious Cuisine from the late 80's , then Rao's and another Mexican place which did not make it.

Got there around 5pm on a Sunday and the restauant was probably about 40% full.  We were seated and ordered drinks.  Drinks and chips and salsa came out pretty fast, but we never saw our waitress again for 10 minutes or so.  When we did, she apologized and explained there was a mix up.  I wouldn't normally take stars away for a small inconvience.



We put in our orders which included an appetizer (cheese and bean dip).  Another 15 minutes later (and feeling forgotten again) we waived our waitress over and asked about the dip as we did not want it to come out with our food.  She returned with it a minute later.  The dip included no beans and had clumps of unmelted cheese from whatever frozen bag it probably came from.  



Our food orders took another 15 minutes (30+ minutes from when we ordered to come out).  No one ever apologized for the delay or warned us that the kitchen was slow which was frustrating.  After reading a few other Yelp reviews, doesn't seem like this is unusual.



My wife got the arroz con pollo which she enjoyed, but didn't think it was any better than other Mexican restaurants.  I got a Tequila Shrimp Burrito.  My burrito had a few chopped up small shrimp and a bunch of large mushrooms (which were not listed in the description).  It was covered with ""Tequila"" sauce which was basically more queso.  Like the queso, the guacomole served on the side did not appear to be made in house.  The rice and beans that came with it were mainly refried beans.  There was a little tiny bit of overcooked rice mixed in the beans (they aren't served separately).  The refried beans did taste like they were made in house, hence the star.



I noticed other tables around us had the same problems with slow service.  A couple that came in 20 minutes after us were served their food 5 minutes before we got our food.

We ordered the smaller plate of Aguachiles ($17!) and Enchiladas in Mole sauce ($7 for lunch)



The wait was very long because I ordered from the dinner menu at lunch time, but that's not a problem. There were 3 complimentary bowls of salsa:  standard, tomatillo and pico de gallo. I liked the pico de gallo, they all tasted ok but they were so bland that we finished all 3 bowls without even noticing it. 



I ordered the Aguachiles because the dish looked exactly like ceviche of filet shrimp that Fiesta Jalisco used to serve at this same location.  But Jalisco's was hot and  delish while this was nothing of the sort. It didn't even have avocado and red peppers like the picture on their menu. All we could taste was first sharp red onions, then lime juice and finally ground jalapenos, bitter and sharp, $17 for a small portion?

I also ordered a sopa de pollo.



When the plate came, there's no CRAB LEG on it. And there's only 2 big shrimp! So no worth for $23! I just told the server to send it back and get me tres amigos(chicken, steak, and shrimp). Such a disappointment. 



Then I found a yellow rubber in my chicken soup!!!!! So I just tell her to switch to shrimp tacos without onions for me. She kept apologizing, but I can see she was annoy by I kept founding something wrong with the order.



And when the tacos came, guess what!!! There's onions on them. You would thought she would paid extra attention to the order since the ""kitchen"" messed up soapy times already. But no!!!!



At the end I just tell her to box up the tacos, even tho there's onion on them. I would have return everything and left if I didn't have the groupon. I definitely will NOT go back.



Oh and she tried to charge me the $23 for the $16 plate I switched to. Ugh never again

ts217,2/19/2014,revtest2187,1,"I honestly don't know how this place stays in business. Why? I will explain. 

We decided to give this place another try after the first review I left on Yelp back in November 2013. I want to be completely fair and impartial  as I know this is a business that wants to succeed. 

My husband , son and I decided to return last night, a Tuesday, and we had the extra bonus of a coupon from the Clipper magazine. We were seated promptly , after all, Tuesday is hardly a busy night in most restaurants. The server , pretty young gal. greeted us, and took drink orders, which came back quickly. OK---the service was fast , not like the first night we were there and that is a plus. Now , the server took our orders and I  would estimate that our dinners were served in about 15 minutes. They looked pretty appetizing and I could not wait to dig in---hubby ordered the mixed Fajitas, our son had the Carnitas, his all time favorite, and I ordered a mixed platter of taco, enchilada and chimichanga. 



If you re-read my first review of this place I had issues with the rice and beans being stone cold so, without delving into the other dishes , I decided to try the rice first---as soon as I placed my fork into the rice I pulled up a five inch long hair that was dangling on the end of the fork!!!  I was so shocked and disgusted I could barely speak. My husband got up immediately to find our waitress and told her what was in the food---her immediate response was ""it's not my hair"" to which my husband repied, ""why does it  matter whose it is, it's hair"". 

 

She took the plate away and asked if I wanted anything else--like I could enjoy a meal after the experience I just had---my poor hubby and son were now bleakly looking at their food and wondering if the same would occur. Fortunately, it did not but how could one enjoy a meal with the thought of the hair maybe turning up in their food!



I think what angered and disturbed us most was that no  manager, male or female , ever came to our table to offer their apologies . I sat there in stunned silence as my husband and son ate , not enjoying this experience and who could blame them?  When done, we asked for the check, minus my meal and the coupon and left without a word or a thank you. 

 

It's  not my intention to ruin the dining experience of others but you will have to decide for yourselves if this is something you wish to endure while dining at this place. I realize these occurrences happen once in a while in the restaurant industry but it is inexcusable for the manager not to at least make an appearance at our table ---was it that embarrassing to you?  Very sad indeed and we will never come back!",negative

Their thick accents mixed with the whispering was very difficult to understand. On top of that, we had about a 15 minute wait for just drinks, and about a 40 minute wait to get our food. We had seven people with us, and three of them didn't fully enjoy the food, and one of them hardly ate any of it. The most enjoyable part of the restaurant was there nice bathrooms. 



Over all we were disappointed and probably will not return to this restaurant.",negative

ts217,7/23/2014,revtest2191,2,"Second time here since we moved from St.Louis, MO 8 months ago. It was OK both times. Upon entering the restaurant today for lunch, the Health Department score was 93.I wanted to turn around and walk out, to me, that speaks volumes about a place that I actually want to eat at. However, my hubby and son wanted to give it a try. The tortilla chips were horrible to me. They gave an oily after taste where I could not even taste the tortilla chip at all. The salsa was good and the 2 shredded beef chimichangas were OK. The environment could have been cleaned much better than it appeared, hazy mirrors, floor needed to be swept. It was very hard to understand our waiter,although I think he was pleasant!



At this point after seeing the 93 score, I think I'd like to try another place that has higher scores. I admit I am a clean freak when it comes to someone preparing my food. As a former Missourian, we did not have number scores to restaurants, only letter scores. Grade A, you would think that was great...until you really see how they come up with that grade after all the mishaps are subtracted from 100. There is a 10 point difference between Grade A & Grade B. I will be looking up this place's score to see how they did on their 93 score inspection.



I love what North Carolina does by posting their scores as you enter the establishment. My new home state, suits me well with their Health Department scores and how they publish it and all the things that were found wrong on inspection day.",negative

No where on the voucher is the word dinner. NO WHERE. We had a great server, Ashley, but management el suckos. There is much better Mexican food in Matthews than this joint as well.  UPDATE after management response ....nowhere on the voucher is the word DINNER mentioned. NO  WHERE! I don't want free food, I make more money than you and have no problem paying for meals. All I wanted was for you to honor the voucher. The voucher isn't for free food either jackass, it's $30 for $15. If I never paid for it how would I have it in my possession? If I never paid for it why would Living Social refund my money for it after you refused it FOR NO REASON? You don't have to be Mexican to be an idiot. Check your new Living Social voucher that went live today too, guess what? THE WORD DINNER IS NO WHERE ON THERE EITHER!   Your business won't last long because of your lack of service and attitude.

Ordering was difficult. If you're getting a sandwich, you have to give your order to a sandwich order taker, who writes it on paper. If you get a salad or soup, you have to go further down the line. This was confusing especially because the woman who took our sandwich order was not clear about what we needed to do, as though this is standard operating procedure at all restaurants.

I simply wanted a sandwich and some soup, but that proved to be too difficult for the superb employees at this Paradise location.



I'm not even too upset about the fact that they didn't have the soup I originally wanted.  That's understandable, since I arrived at 8:00 PM after working out at the gym.



However, I did have a reasonable expectation that someone would actually make a sandwich for me.  Unfortunately, this did not happen.



I stood there at the cash register with a cup of soup and waited and waited.  Seeing as how it appeared as though nobody would be fulfilling my order that night, I decided to cancel it and go somewhere else.



I wish my problem with Paradise ended there, but it didn't.



After a few days passed, I looked at my checking account and they had only reimbursed me for my sandwich, rather than the entire soup + sandwich order that I was charged for.



So, now I need to contact Paradise customer service and try to get $4.40 back.  What a pain in the ass.

ts221,9/19/2013,revtest2203,2,"Well,

I was hoping for better.



I was pretty excited about this place opening up in my 'hood, and I met some friends here for happy hour.



The service started out on a bad note.  When we entered, there were four or five employees congregated around the front entrance, and all greeted us with a friendly hello.  However, once we sat down, our table wasn't approached for approx 5 minutes.  But, this place just opened, and I know new restaurants have kinks to work out, so I'll let that slide.



Onto the happy hour menu.  Happy hour only has discounted drinks, which disappointed all of us as we do enjoy discounted apps, etc.



We ordered a few drinks, two appetizers and one salad entree.  

For appetizers we ordered the Tuscan plate and the green chili cheese dip.  The Tuscan plate was alright, though we would have preferred a mix of different meats and different cheeses maybe (it comes with a goat cheese, salami, roasted red peppers, olives and crostini)

The green chili cheese dip comes with crostini and tortilla chips.  The cheese dip tasted very similar to velveeta cheese dip... which, luckily, I love.  Well, we all love.  But it's not exactly what I expect to be served at a restaurant I guess.  



Camille H ordered the Mexican salad, and it was good- but overly dressed.  



Now, the atmosphere.  Like many other places in this part of Ahwatukee, this place seems to be geared towards older clientele.  We all ended up commenting on the music situation, as it seemed..... well.... not very hip I guess? 



I assume that the kinks with the service and food will be worked out with time.  However, I won't be returning unless the happy hour is revamped and the music selection is changed!",negative
ts221,9/19/2013,revtest2204,2,"Wow.  It's really been a while since I rushed home to write a review.  I met Sarah H and Dan H here tonight for happy hour.  They just opened on Monday and we were excited something new had opened in the Foothills and we wanted to support them.



Well, first off we met here for happy hour but the only happy hour specials they had was on beer and wine.  Not nearly as happy as we were hoping.  We ordered some drinks, I had a nice Sauvignon Blanc, and looked over the menu.  Nothing on the menu is very inspired or unique but I finally settled on a Mexican salad with black beans and chipotle ranch.  Something cool and crunchy and spicy sounded just right.  Dan ordered a Tuscan meat and cheese platter and Sarah wasn't really hungry so she just got the chili cheese dip which I was looking forward to trying anyway.  



We chatted while we were waiting for our food but the place is so loud, it wasn't easy and they had the most god awful music on.  Not quite loud enough you could understand it, but loud enough that it made it difficult to chat.  We thought we heard country music but couldn't be sure.  They definitely need to play something more café-ish to set the ambiance of a good meal with friends rather than being at a rodeo.



Sarah's chili cheese dip came out first and we dug in.  It reminded us a lot of that Velveeta dip you make with a can of Rotel, only not as good.  And they didn't give you much either.  We ate it nonetheless because it's cheese, but I don't think we'll be ordering it again.  Dan's meat and cheese plate looked fine but my salad wasn't quite what I expected.  When I ordered it the waitress asked if I wanted Spring Mix for my lettuce or a green lettuce mix.  While I normally go for the darker greens, I thought a green lettuce mix would be best to stand up to a heavy ranch dressing.  What I got was a mix of spinach and arugula, predominately spinach, which couldn't stand up to the creamy dressing and was a soppy mess.  I ate it, but I can't say I would ever order it again.  Any salad here for that matter as the dressing was put on with such a heavy hand, it made what is normally a light meal, heavy and greasy.  



We paid and were on our way in under an hour.  It was too noisy and not really conducive to a long leisurely evening of chatting, drinking and eating.  Maybe if they change their menu a bit and I give them some time to work out the kinks, I may try it again, but I'm sure.",negative
ts221,10/5/2013,revtest2205,2,"We REALLY wanted to like this place because it's right down the street from us. It's a cute place, but the menu is very limited and the items we ordered were just ok. We tried the Philly Goat and Tuscan bruschetta. My husband enjoyed the Philly Goat, I felt like it should have been served hot (though I realize traditional bruschetta has a cold topping). The Tuscan was just ok. 



Each of us ordered a salad as our entree. He the Strawberry Fields and I the Tino's. Both were underwhelming. We each opted for the ""perfect green blend"" which was mostly spinach. The salads were average at best; I've thrown together far better myself and the dressing on the Tino had an odd flavor that I couldn't place, maybe from the cider.



I would suggest that the ""Choose the Perfect Pear"" menu item allow for a 1/2 sandwich option, not just 1/2 pasta.



Because we want to support neighborhood establishments, we will try it again. I'll try the Grilled Cheese next time. Hopefully it will improve with time.",negative
ts221,11/6/2013,revtest2206,2,"We tried this restaurant because we are new to the neighborhood and love trying new places.  A few observations, wine prices were terribly exorbitant.  At $10 for a glass of no-name Riesling, I just can't seeing myself doing that again.  My family ordered 2 kids meals with grilled cheese, I had the Perfectly grilled cheese (reminded me of a Monte Cristo sans the meat) and my husband had a plate of Alfredo, for what we ordered  $65 including tip just seemed over the top.  I think this place wants to have a high end feel, but the lack of a formal bar (bottles were huddled together on the serving line) and the male owner walking around in FLIP FLOPS, detracts from the high-end feel (think Postino's) that this restaurant wants to achieve.  A few suggestions for the owners (who I recognized from their picture in the paper): DRESS PROFESSIONALLY, and introduce yourselves as the owners so you can get constructive feedback from your patrons.  You'd think that the owners are embarrassed for anyone to know the place is theirs.  Next, move the alcohol behind the counter so you can at least PRETEND you have an actual bar, and please offer wine specials, most people (like me) like to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner and if that part of my dining experience is cost prohibitive, then I won't go to that restaurant for the food.  Next, turn the music down.  Dining is a social experience and if I can't hear people at my table, I'd rather just go somewhere else.  Finally, improve the customer service, your waitresses (and the female owner) dropped things on the table then ran off before we could ask for things like napkins, condiments, etc.  I thought this type of service was very unprofessional and makes me hesitant to return.  Overall, this place has excellent food.  I hope they can make some minor tweaks to their establishment so that they can hang around for the long haul and be a place people can go to in Ahwahtukee for a great meal!",negative

ts221,2/17/2014,revtest2209,1,"So, disappointing, I can't tell you. I live in walking distance and wanted for months to stop in. I finally walked in yesterday (Sunday) at around 4:00pm. Sat outside on the patio overlooking the parking lot and road. Ever since My Big Fat Greek Restaurant closed near by, I've been desperate for a consistent ""go to"" for noshing and drinks. Perfect Pear is a faux bistro with no bar, no charm and zero ambience. The restaurant smelled like smelly cheese - maybe cheap grated romano - so the patio was the escape. The menu offers typical easy-to-make, low risk, but high profit dishes. The drink menu is pedestrian and boring. No buttery chards and warm room temp reds. The waitress thought Pinot Gris was a misprint and apologized !?! So, the foodie in me already knows the pasta selections are embarrassingly ill conceived, so think American corporate like Chili's or Carraba's. So, what to do? Well, order something that few restaurants can screw up --- bruschetta!!  Trendy, high profit, easy with fresh ingredients. The Classic came on soggy focaccia, hardly toasted, with tasteless, off-red tomatoes with red onion and julienne'd basil (not torn). Then, (get this) topped with cheap-of-the-cheap romano cheese (see above). Any shot at being edible was ruined by the grated romano. The Chef must have zero culinary instincts or just doesn't care because there is no real competition in the area. Unforgiveable. The Lolita was actually worse. Please don't say ""avocado"" when you really mean a brown guac spread. We ordered the olives and pesto goat cheese. Why ruin pesto with goat cheese? The crostini with the olives was the best part of the meal. My partner reconstructed the bruschetta using the crostini and the edible parts of what was served. I marvel at new owners who seemingly don't avail themselves of the basic ""how to's"" and ""do's and dont's"" of culinary. 



Please -- owner and chef -- do a dine around in Phoenix, take the entire week and then re-vamp your concept and menu. I'll be back in (3) months because I refuse to go to Native New Yorker. I'm serious.

ts221,10/9/2014,revtest2217,2,"I'm happy to see that a business seems to finally be making it in this location after so many have failed. Ahwatukee, the Foothills in particular, is in dire need of more dining options that aren't pizza or a chain.  As a rule, I avoid new restaurants until they've had a couple of months to iron out the kinks, but I'd been hearing good things about Perfect Pear for a while, so last night, my daughter and I went for dinner. I really wish that I could say that I'm excited to return, but in truth, I probably won't dine there again.



We encountered the first glitch of the evening as soon as we entered. No one was at the front to greet us, nor was there a sign indicating that we should seat ourselves. So for five minutes, we stood there by the entrance feeling a bit foolish. I passed the time by looking at the laminated menu (which gave me pause--I understand the practical aspects of lamination, but, gosh, they really evoke places like Dennys, not a restaurant that clearly is trying to be much more than that). While we waited for someone to direct us, I made eye contact with someone working in the partially open kitchen, but he just ignored us. I told the young lady who eventually seated us that it was our first visit, and that I had no idea whether or not we were supposed to seat ourselves.  I don't think she took my point.



To my relief, our server arrived almost immediately to take our drink orders. Yay!



The menu is limited to starters, salads, pasta and sandwiches, which seems perfectly in line for a bistro, and each category has good variety of offerings. On our server's recommendation, I ordered the Tukee Pear quesadilla to begin the meal.  It came out to the table fairly quickly and was really big. And delicious looking--the tortilla was perfectly crisped and puffed up and contained just the right amount of its filling of pear, bacon, arugula and pepper jack. It was so good, I even convinced my ultra-picky child to try it. The spicy dipping sauce (sour cream-based, I believe) complemented it nicely.  So our meal was off to a really good start.



For my dinner, again on the server's recommendation, I ordered the Wild Chop salad made with their baby green blend (kale, spinach, arugula) with salmon added. I should add here that I LOVE salad. In fact, it's kind of my litmus test for restaurants. I don't care how good the rest of the meal is, if the salad--even just a house side--is some depressing affair thrown together like an afterthought, then whoever is running the kitchen isn't paying attention to the details. That never bodes well.  When the salad *is* the meal, you should expect that just as much care goes into it as any other dish.



This salad landed with an absolute thud. Sadly, the two smallish pieces of salmon were so overcooked, desiccated and hard. This poor fish had been done a grave injustice. Still, I decided to give the rest of the salad a try before throwing in the towel.



I suspect that whoever made my salad doesn't much care for them. What a mess. The greens on top were dry, making me wonder if someone forgot to dress them. There also appeared to be no thought put into the composition of the dish--the greens were randomly topped with a tablespoon or two of plain quinoa, a few long pieces of soggy cucumber and roasted bell pepper, a sad lump of crumbled feta... I took a bite of the greens and couldn't taste any pesto dressing. When I dug down, though, I realized that it hadn't been left off after all--it was all just at the bottom, alas. So some of the salad was under-dressed and rest was drenched. At that point, I just put my fork down and said, ""This is pitiful.""



Meanwhile, my daughter was pigging out on the huge side of seriously good crinkle-cut sweet potato fries that came with her (not) Perfectly Grilled Cheese, which, like my salmon, was terribly overcooked. We could both see that one side of it was pretty charred, but, hey, charred bread can still be tasty. Just not this time. I don't know if the spiced pear bread was a little stale to begin with or if it just suffered during cooking, but the sandwich was really tough and dry. None of the ooey gooey lusciousness I'd expected. My daughter had gamely eaten one half, but abandoned it for the fries. It wasn't until I tried a bite that I realized how bad the sandwich actually was. I let her open up the remaining half and eat the cheese and bacon. I ate some of the bread, anyway, because I was hungry.



To the restaurant's credit, our server handled the salad problem gracefully, apologizing and removing it from the bill. I had a bowl of okay tomato soup instead. I didn't bother complaining about the sandwich, since most of it was eaten. 



I'd hoped that the Perfect Pear would become my go-to neighborhood place for dinner. But I just don't have faith that the kitchen is paying attention to everything that comes out of it. That's a shame.",negative

My boyfriend and I ordered the lettuce wraps as an appetizer, I ordered the orange chicken, and he ordered the Mongolian beef. The main dish comes with a small salad before the meal comes out. The salad wasn't bad kind of small, maybe a little too much dressing. Then we got our appetizer.............I will never ever EVER eat here again! The lettuce wraps came out and it looked quite delicious, as we started eating it I discovered a hair in the dipping sauce for the lettuce wraps. It wasn't a big deal we hadn't eaten it, so we just asked for a new bowl of dipping sauce. Then as we looked at the filling for the lettuce wraps we discovered that the entire dish was filled with short black hairs. We have never had this happen before!!!

The food wasn't really my bag. I didn't want the cook it yourself option (not a fan of handling raw meat at my dinner table) so I opted for a ready made beef soy sauce curry and fried rice. The rice came 10 mins before the main event unfortunately which I nibbled on to stave off my hunger, and once the beef arrived I found it bland and tasteless. Watery, lots of veg but hardly any beef. The pork dumplings I shared with Tanja were nice and flavoursome though. Probably the only thing I liked. 



The atmosphere was lacking a bit in my opinion, too bright and not somewhere I'll choose to go back to. It might be that Korean food just isn't for me but I'd hoped to try and love a new cuisine. All in all, not a fan and won't be back :(",negative
ts224,6/26/2014,revtest2230,1,"I've been trying to get in here for ages, usually last minute when they've had no space, so I was delighted to squeeze in early one night this week. We were shocked and sad to find Shilla closed a couple of weeks ago and hoped to replace it with another good Korean restaurant....



The service was gruff - not welcoming and warm but not rude, just mechanical. We later realised this was a result of the team (of 4 or 5 including chefs) awaiting a large tour group and then focussing all their attention on it. Must have been important people as we had to endure the waiter pacing up and down for 45 mins before they got there, never once asking if we were ok, and then were ignored on the group's arrival until we got the bill.



The starters were ok but nothing special; crab stick pancake & deep fried chicken. The chicken had 2 chillies beside it on the menu and was not at all spicy. We were under-impressed from the start. More than half of mains were something with kimchi, so if you don't like fermented cabbage you're in trouble! 



We had a pork and kimchi with rice and a beef bibimbap, with a side of kimchi. The pork was ok but may not have actually been belly. Not much meat either....My bibimbap stone bowl was so hot that over 20 minutes after it was put in front of me it was CONSTANTLY still cooking everythin in the bowl. Consequently the rice at the bottom was stuck to the bottom an inch thru and essentially all burned. It was 3 chilli spicy, apparently, but not AT ALL SPICY. I mixed the tiny amount of veg and egg yolk with the rice an ended upwith a stodgy, burned, tasteless, mess of a dish. I craved a pot of broth to add or something....4 shreds of beef and adding some of the kimchi side improved it marginally but i left almost alll of it as it was inedible and completely unappetising. 



No one asked if our meal was ok. It was still mostly on the table as we paid, without query, and, if I'm honest, I was depressed all night long after it. What a let down and waste of time.",negative

Ive been going to this place for a pretty long time. However, it was when it used to be SuperMex. tonight was my second time visiting there after they changed.  I gota say that I am not happy with the joint. Super mex used to be a great place to get a cheap and delicious bite to eat. But now its gone :( I used to go in there all the time to enjoy some delicious chicken tortilla soup for around 5 bucks.. which was a great deal. the same soup now comes in a smaller bowl and is nearly double to price. I would have to say that 9 dollars for a bowl of soup is kinda ridiculous for a place like that



The first thing I experienced upon walking in the door was the hostess who gave me a menu COVERED in salsa and food. I opened it to find red sauce just running down the page as well as beans all over it. I told her that it was gross and to give me another one.. She then rolled her eyes and walked away with it.. Never to return with a new one. Finally our server comes out (who was the only reason this place didnt get a 1 star rating) and gave me a new one. Our servers name was Lisa and she was awesome. Very nice and very efficient. She even brought out new chips and salsa without having to be asked.. which is a huge bonus for me, as I love chips and salsa.



We then order our food. I had the Mole. The Mole was very generic.. Good.. but generic. The chicken however, was terrible.. It was very tough and chewy, and had alot of fat on it. I bit into a huge chunk of fat and instantly felt sick,  You could tell the chicken was not cooked in the sauce. I would assume it was thawed out, already cooked and was just warmed up, and covered with the sauce. My gf had the enchiladas, which werent bad, but also very generic in my opinion. 



I gota say the only good reason to go there was the chips and the service.. But not for food. Which is sad because its mostly a restaurant.  It is also more expensive by far after the name change. Save your money and go elsewhere.",negative

ts226,3/5/2014,revtest2235,2,"I remember when this place was old Super Mex, so I was expecting pretty much the same. It was just a weird experience.



From the beginning, the design outside in the front is weird. I guess the symbol is supposed to be a depiction of agave, but it just looks really bad. Also, the front says 24 Hour Video Poker, which I just found strange. Yes to promoting 24 hours, NO to video poker. Just makes it seem like it's going to be really crappy bar food or something. 



The host who sat us seemed like he had no idea how to host. He just seemed lost, but it wasn't a big deal. We got seated very quickly. We were greeted by our server, Jose, who was great. He convinced us to get Margaritas in spirit of Fat Tuesday. He wasn't pushy at all, very friendly and nice. He took our order, and then came back a few minutes later to tell us that he won't be our server tonight. Poor Jose was being sent home because it was slow. It was strange as it wasn't super slow in there. It was even stranger that Jose seemed to linger on about this, almost to the point of talking down about the establishment. It was sad, I liked Jose and wanted to give him a tip but I didn't have change and he had to leave. 



We were told of the special, which sounded like Chic Parm, except substitute chicken with steak. It sounded awful so we went with Carne Asada and my friend got Shrimp tacos. My carne asada, for the price they charged, was pretty wack. You expect carne asada to be very tasty and tender. It lacked the juiciness and the tastiness of carna asada. The rice and the refried beans were good though. Shrimp tacos were all right as well.



Then it just took forever to A) get the bill and B) get the server to get the money back to pay the bill. In the meantime I had a random woman (guessing it's the owner) asking me if everything was all right. It was, it was just strange. Who are you? Are you the owner? Random patron? What is going on in this place?!



Finally got someone to pick up my check. The total was $19 and some change. I put in a twenty. I get it back and I get no change. I mean we're talking about like 50 cents or so, but really? I didn't get any change back? All right? 



I'm not mad about the experience, it was just really underwhelming. I love Mexican food. I think this place has just a major image issue. What is it? Is it an authentic Mexican restaurant with Jalisco specific recipes? Or is it like the Mexican version of PTs? Or is it Mexican version of Applebees? Is Jalisco spanish for Applebees?",negative
ts226,3/7/2014,revtest2236,2,"Jalisco, I'm sorry, but we need to break up. It isn't me. It's you. 100% you.



Last night, the wife and I went to Jalisco for dinner. We were seated quickly enough. The chips and salsa were brought right out. We even had our drink order taken quickly. Our server, Esmerelda, appeared shortly thereafter and took our order. 



My order: 3 Combination plate - Cheese enchilada, Shredded Chicken Enchilada, Shredded Chicken Crunchy Taco and all rice, no beans.



30 minutes later, Esmerelda stops by the table and asks us if we would like dessert. Ummm, I would prefer dinner first. She had a look of confusion flash across her face, glanced at the kitchen, the fear of realizing she had left our food in the window for who knows how long flashed next, before she said our food would be right out.



Imagine that, 30 seconds later, our plates were brought out. My ""crunchy"" taco was soggy, fell apart the moment I lifted it up. The kicker? Shredded beef, not chicken. Ok, I'll eat the rest, while we wait for her to check on us. First enchilada I dove into, also shredded beef. Seriously guys? 30 minutes and you send out poorly made, wrong food?



Finally, Esmerelda stops back by, we show her how everything was wrong with my food. She says they'll get me the right food out right away.



While waiting for that food to arrive, I give the cheese enchilada a try. What could they do wrong with that, you ask? Somehow, the cheese was chewy. Not standard cheesy deliciousness chewy, but did they put some gum, or old tire in the cheese chewy. 



After a much shorter than 30 minute wait, a plate with a chicken enchilada, actual crunchy taco, rice and beans was delivered to the table. By then, I was a little over the entire experience and tired of chewing, after consuming the cheese enchilada.



The last two items were decent, not good, but decent. 



Needless to say, Jalisco is not on my list of places to eat again. Ever. 



This happened on a Thursday evening, they had maybe 3 other tables when we got there, no big rush leaving or entering at any time when we were there, so it wasn't like we got lost in the shuffle.

They still have the grilled veggie burrito on the menu that Super Mex had, and I decided to order it again now that they're JC. Man, what a mistake!

Brought my Mom for the ride and she said she could smell the black pepper clear across the booth! Absolutely awful!

I figure that a 3 out of 5 is a place I would return to, and unfortunately, this will not make the cut.  I wanted it to be good, as it is very near where I will be moving to, and I wanted a nice close-in Mexican restaurant.  Will try and be brief:



1.  Hostess friendly, seated promptly (Sunday around 7:00 PM)

2.  Waiter quickly brought chips, salsa, and beans to table.  This was a positive, as that is my expectation at Mex restaurants.  Salsa was good, beans were lukewarm and very firm like they had been sitting drying out for a while.  Chips were just ""ok"" at best.  Couldn't quite tell if they had been fried up there that day or not.  I want HOT chips that have just been salted and evidence they had just come out of a fryer less than 10-15 min prior.

3.  Food, kinda bland.  I got a combo plate, chicken ""crispy"" taco (soggy by the time it got to me as it laying on wet lettuce), an average cheese enchilada, and average rice and beans.

4.  The ""cadillac"" margarita definitely had tequila in it, which I was impressed by, but I thought it was a fairly small glass and not real flavorful with real lime juice, etc.



So . . . will I return?  Very doubtful.  Lindo Michoachan pretty much sets the standard for food/service/presentation in Vegas, and JC gets a 4 on a 10 LM scale.  Again, regrettable as I wanted this to be a go to place for local Mex.



Revision 1/6/2015

The owners have reached out to me by my comments and are very concerned I did not have a first rate experience.  I am encouraged by that and they urge us to give them another try (which I will do).

ts227,11/8/2014,revtest2248,2,"This place is an example of how things can go awry if expectations and experience are out of whack--and not in the right direction.  I visited for lunch today on a bike ride--I'd seen their signs on the path, so I looked them up on Yelp, and saw that most people seem to like them.  I also looked up their menu ahead of time, and saw that they offer soup in a bread bowl and macaroni and cheese--two of my favorite comfort foods with particular appeal at this time of year, when it's getting cooler.  According to their website, they're open on Sat. until noon, so I timed my ride so I could stop by.



Upon finding the place (which took some doing), I walked in and stood by the counter. There were several other customers, and one employee was busy getting their food, and the other (an owner/manager, I assume) was chatting with them (I assume they're regulars).  After several minutes, the owner/manager asked me if I'd been helped, and I told him I hadn't, so he asked me if I'd prefer to eat in or take out, and I told him I'd like to eat in.  He told me I could have a seat and the other employee would be right with me to take my order, so I picked a table and sat down.  The table had a menu at it labeled ""Saturday Menu"" that had the same selections listed as the website.  When the other employee came over after a couple of minutes, I asked her what soups they had.  She explained that they don't offer soups on Sat.  Unfazed, I asked her about getting a sandwich/side combo, and she told me that they don't offer sides on Sat., either.  She then proceeded to tell me that they only offer breakfast and lunch sandwiches on Sat.  (Umm, then why are sides, soup, etc. listed on the ""Saturday Menu?"")  I asked her if she had a recommendation, and she said that she liked all the sandwiches she'd tried.  I asked her what she thought of the muffaletta, and she said she hadn't tried it yet, but since I hadn't ever had one, I decided to order it.



The sandwich came out after a few minutes. According to Wikipedia, muffalettas are traditionally served cold, but can be heated--this one came as a panini.  I thought the flavor was decent, though, as I mentioned, I don't have a standard to judge by.  When I finished, my waitress came by and asked if I wanted anything else.  Since this place is known for their baked goods, I checked what was available, and a cinnamon roll muffin caught my eye, so I decided to get it.  Without asking if I'd like it boxed up for takeout, the owner/manager boxed it up, so I paid and left.  Upon arriving home, I heated the muffin briefly (as the owner/manager suggested) proceeded to eat it.  The first bite was stale and bland, and I couldn't taste any cinnamon.  Even the middle of the muffin contained very little cinnamon--the only saving grace was the cream cheese icing.  Since it was the last one, I'm guessing that the muffin had been sitting around since at least yesterday. As someone who's no stranger to eating several-day-old baked goods, this muffin didn't age well.



Overall, I'm sorry to say that this was a rather disappointing lunch, in light of the lack of selection and food quality.  I'm guessing that the food selection and quality--and possibly also the service--is much better during weekdays.  Unfortunately, I live and work (9-5) in Oakland, so it's impractical for me to visit during weekdays.  While I applaud the owners for opening the business in an out of the way location and for having some weekend hours, I'd advise them to be upfront about item availability on Sat.  If you're only going to serve sandwiches and breakfast items on Sat., then please make a Sat. menu that includes only these items and post it on the website and at the tables.  If you're going to bill yourself as a cakery, then please offer at least some fresh baked goods every day (including Sat.).  As for potential customers, while this place may be worth visiting on weekdays, I'd advise you to stay away on Sat. until the management makes some changes. 2.5 stars.",negative
ts228,12/9/2013,revtest2249,1,"Where to begin.. 



Well first we go in and it has just recently opened so I'm going to try to give them the benefit of the doubt.. So me and my father are in Line waiting to order and a woman comes up and says ""what's your favorite here?"" To which we reply ""oh it's actually our first time"" so she yells out ""FIRST TIMERRRRR!!!"" And the rest of the staff yells that as well and it was a bit embarrassing but I understand it's a gimmick so I went along. 



NEXT: I go to order a vegetarian burrito, and keep in mind everything is laid out and you choose what you want JUST like chipotle, so the guy goes to throw cheese and enchilada style just assuming that's what I wanted and I had to tell him ""no none of that either please"" so then I get to the part where they put the Lettuce, tomato, etc and before I can put anything IN my burrito the guy puts pinto beans on TOP of the burrito then puts it through a cooker and I say ""oh I wasn't done building the burrito"" and he replies ""you actually get it all on the side and put it on yourself.."" So I get the salsa, lettuce, and ""one free scoop of guacamole"" on the SIDE which is already annoying because any Mexican food place I go to ESPECIALLY where you build it there the stuff goes IN the burrito so there is no hassle and the woman says ""you have to ask in advance for us to put it on for you""



NEXT: my dad gets a chicken quesadilla which is literally a kids size, and when I go to pay I also add 2 drinks, and the woman says ""since that's a kids size I can only sell you a kids size drink..."" Are you kidding me???? Not to mention no one said it was a kids size, he asked just for a chicken Quesadilla and that's what they give him? I guess you have to ask in advance for a regular size? And as we go to sit down the woman behind us with a distraught look on her face passes us at the drink station and says ""wow why does this Place have to be so confusing?!"" 



FINALLY: we sit down and at this point I need a SECOND plate just to build my own burrito (litterally) and when I go to pick it up, the salsa liquid got UNDER the burrito causing it to be soggy and it literally breaks apart all over the place and turns to mush.. At this point I asked for a refund so I could leave and as I'm waiting for the money back the woman from earlier who yelled ""first timerrrr"" asked me how it wAs, and when I said I got a refund she replies ""you should have got it enchilada style like I said..."" Keep in mind I did take a bite before refunding and I will tell you it is the exact same spitting image of chipotle... Just more exspensive and more of a hassle and a lesser size of a burrito... Just go to chipotle across the street and save yourself a headache and a bad dining experience.",negative
ts228,1/22/2014,revtest2250,2,"Eh. Trying too hard is the phrase that comes to mind. Why, if they bill themselves as fresh Mexican food, do they smother everything in cheese and super salty sauce? I ordered the nachos and hubby had the enchiladas. First of all, his plate was pretty skimpy for $9. Two little enchiladas and a bloop each of rice and beans. My nachos were more generous, but what the heck is the point of nachos when the chips are too brittle to use as a scoop? The running everything through the oven was interesting, but again, what about ""fresh""?

Employees were friendly enough and sang a round of ""Nacho Man"" when I ordered the nachos. It wouldn't have been so bad if the song hadn't sounded like a funeral dirge, but there was no other silliness.

ts228,2/10/2014,revtest2252,2,"I have been a HUGE fan of Cafe Rio and went to the Gilbert location many many times when I lived in the East Valley.  I would actually drive more than 10 miles each way to get there I enjoyed it so much.  



Once I heard they were opening a location on my new end of town I was thrilled to say the least.  It was going to be my new regular place to go for Mexican food each week.  



Well......that is not exactly the way it turned out. 



I've been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so I write this review in confidence that I did not simply just catch them on a bad day.  



Each time the line to get through was painfully slow.  The last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes (yes I timed it) for us to be served.  I'm not amused by their singing in the least.  That does not show me that the staff is enjoying their shift.  In fact, they seemed stressed,  grumpy, and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.  



I'm willing to bet a big reason for that is the fact that they were understaffed each time.  Only 2 people working the front line?  Come on Cafe Rio. You guys are too busy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.  They did not have a runner refilling the bins either; not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.  Hey management/ownership, you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.  



Once we navigated the line and survived the slow service, we get to the end where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.  They only had a tiny bit left, and they put that on top.  We looked at them and said, is that all you have?  We were told they would bring some more out soon.  When we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge. So, they charged the $2.50 (or so) for it and said they would bring it out to us.  



By this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.  In this case, an extra $2.50.  then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.  $2.50 for that?  Hardly....we took it back inside and got our money back for that.  I know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap, but come on, stop being so chincy, CR.

On my first experience with that I took the burrito back and asked for a new one with less sauce and I always make sure to ask for less sauce now on here.

My big complaint from today is how the manager on duty checked us out at the register and denied us any stamps because we bought the taco special meals for Tuesdays. I have always been given stamps even for taco tuesday meals. She tried to tell me it was policy but if I would have known that I wasn't getting stamps up front I wouldn't have come on Tuesday and I would have spent my $17 on a couple other meals and not tacos.

Today I Went to the Cafe Rio Mexican Grill for lunch. The restaurant was crowded, however people were moving through the cafeteria style line and receiving their entrée's very fast. 



At Cafe Rio, you select the type of food you want to eat, add the meat, beans, sauces, and extras according to your own preferences.  Everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. The tortillas at Cafe Rio are made to order so I knew I was going to order a burrito because I really enjoy homemade tortillas.



As your looking at the menu it seems as if you are being hurried through the serving line.  On my first visit I ordered  a sweet pork burrito with, cheese, black beans, rice and salsa.  As you place your order, the food is passed down the cook line and tossed behind  onto a conveyor belt which runs your entrée through an oven. 



To be honest I was somewhat disappointed in the quality and taste of the food.  My entrée had an overwhelming taste of salt, it was all I could taste.  The burrito just wasn't very good.



I assumed that Cafe Rio would be another version of Chipoltle because the serving style and food items are very similar but I think I prefer Chipoltle.

When I found out there would be a cafe rio right around the corner from my house here in Avondale, I think I almost jumped out of my chair.  When I first went to this restaurant I was somewhat disappointed though.  When I ordered my salad they forgot most of the items, but put extremely large amounts of the items they remembered on it.  I chocked this up for ""this place is new and they are still learning the ""cafe rio"" ways"".  I went back again, and I ordered the tortilla soup.  When I got home, I found out they only put chicken and broth in the soup.  I again just chocked it up to it being so new.  



I go back because I LOVE THE FOOD, but this particular Cafe Rio is so inconsistent with their knowledge and their attitude towards everyone.  The Cafe Rio downtown Phoenix, Mesa and all of the Cafe Rio's that I have been to in Utah are EXTREMELY friendly and always aware of the menu, at this Cafe Rio, no one can ever remember what is on the menu or what size items are supposed to come in.  



Today I went back, again because I LOVE the food and I want to keep giving this place another chance, but when I walked up to the front like I usually do, the lady behind the glass grabbed a tray and just stared at my sister and I.  Then after staring for a moment or two, stated ""Can I help you""... we informed her we would like the kids casadilla with chicken.  On the menu it says ""choice of beans or rice  and comes with chips and drink.""  When she asked us ""beans and rice?"" we said yes please.  Then towards the end, we asked why we didn't get chips, the cashier said ""you got beans and rice"".  We then said well we are confused because it comes with chips and a drink. The lady at the front said ""no, you can pick 2 of the 3 items.""  When we told her we were confused because that is not how it is written on the menu she just stated our total again. I don't care about what is in the kids meal, but the menu is inconsistent with what they tell us at the beginning.  



I love this food, except when it is prepared by the people at this particular venue.  

-Staff never knows the menu

-Staff rarely friendly

-Food never has accurate ingredients (i.e wrong cheese, no pico, only chicken and broth in the tortilla soup etc.)

-Poor amounts of items (too much dressing, too little chips, not enough cheese, etc.)

First off, I love Tex Mex food.  I've been eyeing this place, as I dine at the Genghis Grill next to it WAY too often.  So, I rolled the dice today and tried this place.



Waitress was friendly and chips, salsa and a Diet Coke arrived fairly quickly.  I ordered the #6 lunch combo, essentially chicken over a bed of rice topped with their queso sauce.  Sounds yummy, I though, as I've had it before at other Tex Mex places and LOVED it.  At other places I frequent, it's called ACP, which is Arroz Con Pollo; Spanish for chicken and rice.  



Sadly, the chips and salsa were the highlight of the dining experience.  The chips are very thin and the salsa is OK, if a little watery.  But they DID have flavor and were enjoyable as I waited for my lunch.  I had enough salsa for about half of the chips and stopped when my food arrived.



My food arrived, and I knew I was going to be disappointed by looking at it.  First off, they used shredded chicken instead of grilled chicken.  I wasn't given the option when I ordered, so I guess that's the default.  Secondly, the rice looked and tasted like it was left over from yesterday.  It was just mush on my plate.  If you looked for individual grains of rice, they were nowhere to be found.  But, still, there was this mush of ""rice"" under my shredded chicken and queso sauce.



I ate as much of the meal as I could, which was only about half of it.  I ran out of Diet Coke and sat there HOPING someone would notice I needed more.  I sat in a booth right next to the kitchen and runner after runner passed my table, but noone asked if I needed a refill.  My wiatress was assigned to a large group towards the back of the restaurant, so service suffered somewhat.  



I finally put my credit card on the table, and the waitress finally showed up and asked if everything was good.  I didn't complain, but I'm sure the look on my face told the story.  I just asked for my check.  The total was $10.70.  I left a $1.30 tip for a grand total of $12.00.

They did come on the side, of a plate so hot that I almost had a facial. The plate had spent time in an oven, then had fresh lettuce, onions, and cilantro plunked down... so it was almost like a fajita! Except that I didn't want cooked onions and cilantro. It also came with a lime. 



Fresh lime squirted on tacos is delicious. I managed to finally squeeze one drop from the shriveled lime I received. When I questioned the manager about the tacos and the hot plate he was very considerate and offered to replace the food, which was very nice.

Went for lunch on a Wednesday with a friend. We met at noon, and there were probably about five other tables sitting down & eating when we arrived. We were greeted warmly and told to sit where we liked. 



Our server quickly stopped by & was polite. We both ordered an open-face sandwich, and my friend ordered a bowl of asparagus soup - she was excited to know that it was vegan & made fresh.



It was at this point that our experience turned from being great to 'meh'. We waited for nearly 45 mins to get our sandwiches. Someone (not our server) did stop by and let us know that our orders were under way & apologized for the wait. When our sandwiches finally came, my friend asked about her soup - and was told it would be out shortly. She then asked to cancel the order, as she really didn't think she'd have room to try it after the sandwich. Why they didn't think to bring it out during the previous 45 minutes we were waiting is beyond me.



About five minutes later we called our server over and asked how long their crepes took to make. I'm 7 months pregnant, and once I saw that they had Nutella Crepes on the menu, it was really all I could think about. She said about 10 minutes - so I asked her to put an order in (worried that it would take far longer, judging how long the sandwiches took.)



She came out to our table a short time later and informed us that they were all out of crepes. But they had ice-cream, should I want that. I am by no means an expert or even remotely experienced with running a restaurant, but how do you run out of crepes? I have made them before- you put a few ingredients together & then cook them on the stove. AND there is a grocery store in the same complex, so if you had run out of, let's say, eggs - couldn't you go buy some?

We were two hours from close and our server suggested we call ahead so they can set some aside for is next time. Unbelievable.



For a breakfast sandwich, the replacement starch is their delicious French bread. It's fantastic but you only get one piece and instead of it being built like a sandwich, it's a mini omelette on a piece of bread.



I've also had their burger. I asked for medium and received a greasy well-done chewy burger. The fries looked like they'd soaked in oil overnight and the burger came with an herby mayo that tasted nice but was not represented on the menu.

There were a few people there (not crowded, not empty).  I was seated right away and offered the choice of ice tea or lemonade. They had green or black ice tea of which I got the black.



I looked over the menu and settled on the black truffle burger for $14.  The burger was small, but served with fries and a side salad. The burger was kind of bland and the mushrooms didn't taste like truffle or truffle oil.  The bun was interesting, but the bottom was soggy.  The truffled fries didn't taste of truffle at all. The small salad of greens and tomatoes was good. Unfortunately nothing about my burger with black truffles or my truffle fries tasted like truffle.



My bill was over $18 with tax and over $22 with tip.  My food was not bad and the service was good, but lunch failed on a price-performance basis.



I doubt I will be back.",negative
ts233,11/16/2014,revtest2282,2,I love this restaurant and have been coming here since its original opening. Today the service has been absolutely horrid. I had to ask to get a table cleaned. Ask for a menu. People seated near me are now eating. Had to ask the waiter to please take my order. Is anyone else experiencing these problems here? Worth waiting for the food as it was amazing. Never have seem my waiter again. Guess I'll go inside and ask for my check and tip myself for my hard work.,negative

Its the type of rice you typically see in Mexican dishes and really weird to have in both the chinese food and the sushi.  The veggies in the fried rice tasted like they were the frozen bag variety and just the usual carrots and peas, no bean sprouts or any other goodies.  Beef was chewy, but the chicken was OK.  Noodles were also decent.  Bad rice at an asian place is a deal breaker tho.",negative

First off, there is no English menu, and when you ask the wait staff for one they will proclaim (triumphantly was it?) that they only have a French menu. I was not offered an apology or an explanation... It's montreal in the summer time, cater to your tourists a bit!



The food was uninspired and incredibly over prices. $14 for a scant cup of cold diced steak and some shaved raw veggies? $22 for a hotdog?!? I don't care if it's 12 inches, it is just a hotdog!!

ts237,5/6/2014,revtest2288,2,"After my third visit to Vida Vida, I feel victim to a bait-and-switch. My first visit was about a week after their opening and I was impressed. Tacos were great with plenty of guac, pico, and flavor. Margarita was fresh and authentic. All of this for less than $15 was great.



Then came the second and third visits. We tried different drinks and tacos, along with some of the same we had the first time. Drinks were terribly sweet and very weak. I could not even drink my jalapeño margarita; it tasted like I was drinking a green pepper, bitter and earthy. The tacos no longer had the healthy dose of guac and pico. My carnitas taco had about a teaspoon of guac. The ingredients had lost all freshness and just tasted meh. 



Will return once they regroup and get back to the food and drinks they were originally pumping out.",negative
ts237,6/13/2014,revtest2289,2,"I don't even know where to begin. Yes I do, from the beginning. Because that's when things went wrong. Our waitress (#1) took our order (2 drinks, chips and queso), no big deal. A few minutes later her shift ended so she brought another waitress (#2) over to us and introduced our new waitress. Great, no problem. Except less than 5 minutes after we get transferred, our new waitress gets her purse and walks out. I mean I'm not one to judge a smoke break. Whatever. Except this 'break' lasted 15 minutes and after realizing this chick was not coming back, I had to go to the bar to order another drink. The bartender seemed baffled, rightfully so. He was now having to do her job. 



The bartender brings me my drink, the waitress is still gone. I really thought she had completely peaced out! We ordered another drink, and eventually this girl strolls back in like its nothing. She comes up to us after walking around the room for awhile, completely oblivious to the fact that she was failing at her job. 



Fast forward, all of the girls working at the taco bar decide to put together a World Cup cutout. The kind of thing where you put your face in it and take a picture. There were FIVE of them working on it. Working so diligently that they were ignoring the customers. Including the 2 nice women who sat next to us and waited for at least 10 minutes, and eventually got up and left to get a waitress from Vida to try to help them. I even notified one of the waitresses that 2 customers had left because they were ignored. 



The real kicker comes when I decided that after all of that, I had to try some tacos to see 1) what they tasted like and 2) how much worse it could get. Disclaimer, I filled the order sheet our wrong. But after waiving down the waitress/female bartender, explaining that I did not in fact want a platter, just two tacos, she agreed and went on her way. This is also a different waitress (#3) than we originally had, that one (#2) was still working on the cardboard cut out. 



The food comes, guess who is served 6 tacos? What in the world am I going to do with those? So then waitress #2 (the one who left the restaurant, not the one who took the taco order) came over and asked how everything was. I said you know the tacos are great buttttt we didn't order 6 of them. I explained what happened, she says 'oh so you didn't want these?' We said no, we just can't eat that many. She picks up the tray with the remaining 4 and walks off. I know we didn't want to pay the $17 for 6 tacos, or even eat that many, but common restaurant courtesy is that if you bring out the wrong thing, you leave it. Considering the hassle of the entire situation, it seemed reasonable. I guess not?



Okay so the pluses? The fried chicken taco was good. The male bartender was SUPER nice and receptive when I asked him to go light on the agave in my marg. I am a Texas girl who just wanted some queso, margaritas and tacos. I think that male bartender was the only one competent enough to even be working there. Vida Vida, your potential is there but your staff lacks basic restaurant skills.",negative
ts237,6/23/2014,revtest2290,2,"The only reason I'm giving Vida Vida 2 stars is because the food (if you ever manage to get it) is rather delicious and well priced.  The Fried Chicken Taco is one of the best tacos I've ever had, and better than any of the tacos on Vida's menu IMO.  



The service however, is atrocious.  The concept here is that you sit down, fill out a slip of paper with your order selections, the waitress takes your slip of paper, and then brings you what you ordered.  Seems pretty simple huh? Well apparently it is much harder to keep track of pieces of paper and enter orders correctly than one could ever imagine.  I've been here 4 times and during 3/4 of our visits, someone in our party either had their entire order lost, or the wrong items entered.  The waitress' have never been apologetic or attentive and all seem like they stepped out of la la land. As a former waitress (for 8 years) I know we all have our bad days, but these ladies have all had bad months, and their aloofness doesn't help.  



I want to be hopeful about the future of Vida Vida and attribute the terrible service to the fact that the restaurant is new, but there are only so many times you can go to a place and continue to be disappointed before you don't go back anymore.",negative
ts237,7/8/2014,revtest2291,1,"Against my better judgment, I gave Vida Vida another shot. The service could not have been worse; I should have walked out. To start, our server never introduced herself, just a snappy ""what do you want to drink?"" Right then would have been a good time to leave. After completing the order sheets we put them in the holder to signal we were ready. Server just ran by and grabbed them without saying a word; that would be the last time she stopped at our table. Our server's poor mood made us feel very uncomfortable. There was a lot of employee drama going on; plenty of heated looks and discussions between servers. I felt like I was in a terrible reality show.  



20 minutes waiting for our check and we were out of there. I may have been running with how uncomfortable the whole experience was. 



On a positive note, the food has improved slightly and the bartenders appeared friendly.",negative
ts237,10/8/2014,revtest2292,2,"This is just not my week for tacos. The speed of getting food in a fast casual establishment brand like this was abysmal. Management seems to be absent.



Monday catch up lunch with 3 friends to meet at 11:30 am. Most of us are there by 11:40 am, we get a table, the waitress brings our drinks. Ordering is sushi style, that is a pad of paper and pencils, and one marks the number of each item you want, and order everything all at once.  I ordered a plethora: Chicken, Fried Chicken, Carnitas, and Veggie Tacos. Plus churros, I was hungry. At $3 each is what a taco should be. There is a platter special of 6 tacos for $17 but one is limited to 3 choices and I wanted to sample flavors.



Waitress comes by and collects our orders, my receipt says 11:57am. Our late friend arrives just after noon, he gets his order in about 12:10.



Around 12:20pm guess which item comes out first? Guess. The churros! One has to wonder how it takes 20 minutes to make fried dough rolled in sugar. It's worse the dessert came first. Food finally arrived around 12:30. We were all so hungry we tore into it, so I'm not going to have a lot of nuance to say. The carnitas were moist, and a stand out among what was ho-hum and coldish. All came on corn tortillas.



Waitress came by to ask how our order was and apologized for the churros coming out first when she brought the checks at 12:43pm. If someone had come out and said hey Vida Cantina's kitchen was slammed I would have understood but being left waiting on such a simple meal is terrible.",negative

In my opinion the reviews are not real.",negative
ts238,8/12/2014,revtest2295,2,"We found this place via a friend on Facebook who came here and said on FB it was GMO Free and the food was amazing.  As usual, I went onto Yelp and a majority of the reviews were 5 stars but if you go a ways down you will find some 4's and below.  We decided to try this place for lunch today because of the hype on GMO Free, Organic and amazing.  Since others have mentioned the excellent servers they have had let me tell you about our server Victor.  It took him a long time to get to our table, good thing for the hostess as she got us our drinks and took our appetizer order.  Victor finally came and proceeded to go over the entire menu trying to sell us on everything that were his favorites which seemed to be everything but this place still has not had its grand opening.  



I don't want to be sold on food, let me try it and give my opinion.  He seemed really off today and later you will understand why.  He brought out our appetizer, Tostaditas De Tinga's, 3 small tostada's with white meat chicken and sauce.  When he got to the table, he dumped one of the tostada's on my wife...He was very apologetic and cleaned it up quickly and brought us a new order on the house.  He also tried to explain being off on his sick daughter from the day before but then we heard him tell the table next to us that he had been next door at the Sapphire Club all night.  By the way, this is the same building as  the Sapphire Gentlemen's Club, the same parking lot and the same owners...



Chef Paco who everyone talked about in their reviews obviously was not here today.  Our appetizer lacked in seasoning, all white meat chicken boiled and not like what you would find in Mexico.  We had the table side guacamole which was pretty good, but the Carne Asada Taco's and the Al Pastor Taco's lacked in taste as well compared to the authentic foods of Mexico.  The rice was white rice with no seasoning at all, very bland.  The beans tasted like canned beans, which brings up a funny story...Our waiter first said the beans were from a can but then came back and said he talked to one of the cooks who said they were not canned, they were made in house daily.  NOT...



The Flan was good but did not seem like home made daily like they claim.  Any chicken dish from the Tostada's to the pulled chicken burrito I brought my daughter was very bland.  Needless to say we were very disappointed as we were hoping for an amazing meal, GMO Free and Organic however the corn tortillas did not taste like fresh corn tortillas.    



This is not a place we will go back to as you can find better tasting authentic mexican food about anywhere in town.  I am sure Chef Paco is an amazing person but whether he is there or not, the menu items should always be cooked the same way and if they were going for what you would find in Mexico, the mark was really missed here.",negative

I definitely won't be back here.",negative
ts238,10/5/2014,revtest2297,2,"I was skeptical to eat here after I saw desserts garnished with maraschino cherries and many of the dishes garnished with chips.



There location is right next door to a strip club so I think they may have recruited some of their employees. 



As soon as we were seated the chips were brought out. I like a Mexican restaurant where they bring out the chips before you have to ask. The chips were a mix of blue and yellow. I found this very tacky especially because they claim to be an ""upscale"" Mexican restaurant. I was not thrilled with any of the salsas, in particular the yellow one which had no flavor only heat. I ordered the albondigas soup, lettuce wraps, and steak & shrimp fajita platter. The broth of the soup was subtly seasoned but the vegetables in the soup were cut sloppily, and the meatball was dry and flavorless. Accompanying the soup was a pile of chips, why would I need more chips when you give unlimited baskets of chips? The lettuce wraps were difficult to eat because the guacamole was on the bottom making the lettuce wrap bottom heavy. Guacamole tasted like mashed up avocados with no type of seasoning. The fajita platter looked like a typical fajita platter. The guacamole was flavorless and the sour cream was so runny that I doubt it's homemade. Steak was well cooked albeit salty and the shrimp were jumbo in size but not deveined. And once again, the black beans were garnished with a chip. 



I can't see why this is considered an upscale Mexican restaurant except for the decor.",negative
ts238,11/3/2014,revtest2298,1,"The other 4-5 star reviews here are very suspicious. Based solely on the Yelp reviews, a group of 4 of us went to dinner on Sunday night-very quiet inside, maybe 1/2 full with not one person sitting at the bar. We knew something was wrong when it took 15 minutes to get the chips and salsa and  a few chips were in the basket- not your typical ""overflowing basket o chips"" as is usually the case at a good Mexican restaurant. The salsa was actually quite good.



That unfortunately was the highlight. It then took another 15 minutes to order drinks and Table Side Guacamole and place our entree order,



After another 15 minutes and after us asking, we got our drinks- but no guac yet. We waited about 20 more minutes and asked for the check. Never got the guac and didn't care to wait for the entrees suspecting they'd be as bad as the service- plus we didnt want a 3 hour meal.



Clearly they were understaffed, but we felt that the whole place did not live up to any of these suspicious Yelp reviews, It also looks nicer in the pictures than it really is- pretty cheaply decorated.



On the cab ride back to our hotel we told the cab driver the reason we went was the reviews. He too said he recently went and had bad service that took forever and he has no idea how they got these reviews.



One guy in our group was wary from the minute we pulled up and he was right- this place is just bad news. It is sitting on a skanky side street next to a strip club for a reason- most horny drunk guys wont care about a bad meal.",negative

ts238,12/21/2014,revtest2300,2,"We went to this restaurant based on reviews seen on yelp. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Saturday night. Upon arrival we were quickly seated. I was shocked that this place was next to a strip club but you would never know it once inside. The decor was festive and modern. There are large booths around a bar. Once seated someone brought  a few waters and said will return with chips. He came back and said someone would be with us soon to take our order. We waited about 10 minutes and no one returned. The same person came back and said he would take our drink order and someone else would take our food order. He suggested we start on the table side guacamole and we agreed. We watched the server go to the bartender and tell him he wasn't sure who our server was supposed to be but we had been sitting there awhile.  It was definitely awkward. The gm of the restaurant also came by but still no waiter. He came back with our delicious but spicy jalapeño margaritas and we snacked on chips and salsa. There were three provided: a red salsa with medium heat, a green salsa very flavorful, and a thin red sauce that looked and tasted like straight up hot sauce. It would have been nice if there was an explanation of the three. Next was the table side guacamole. The server came with all the fixings and asked us what we preferred in our guacamole. He went over the menu, explaining everything was non gmo including the chips. He also apologized that our server still hadn't been by. There were two small wedding parties taking place but aside from that there were only three other tables including ours. No real excuse for our ""waiter"" to not have been by in the 30 minutes we had been there. We snacked on the guacamole which needed more salt but overall was very good. You could taste the fresh avocado and freshly smashed garlic. 



Our waiter finally showed up and I asked his opinion on what dish to order. He said hmm let me see the menu and suggested the pork chili verde. My fiancé ordered a carne asada burrito. Our food came quickly, almost too quickly compared to the wait for a waiter.  The mole looked unappetizing on the plate chucks of meat under a thick green sauce covered in pepitas. I have had mole before but it never looked like this. I tasted a chuck of meat which was fork tender. It was hard to get it down. The meat tasted microwaved! My fiancé tasted it and suggested I eat half of his burrito it was that bad! I decided to taste another piece, it was Inedible there was no way I could eat it. I moved on to the black beans...horrible too! They lacked in flavor and seasoning. It was like they opened the can and put it on a plate. The cilantro rice along side tasted like uncle bens rice with seasoning.  The carne asada burrito on the other had was awesome! The meat was so tender and flavorful. 



Overall, I would probably not make the drive back to return for a meal. If in the area, maybe for happy hour which offers half off drinks and appetizer specials but the experience in a whole was a turnoff. I will stick with Leticia's  Mexican cucina in Centennial Hills which is always good.",negative
ts238,12/23/2014,revtest2301,2,"Yelp! Say it ain't so! You've led me astray! With an almost 5 star rating, I was expecting some bomb ass Mexican food. If it weren't for the kindness and customer service skills of the general manager, I would have given El Dorado's 1 star. We came on Monday around 7PM, on locals night. As many others have attested, this restaurant is kind of hard to find. Parking was extremely crowded (Sapphire's must be a popular strip club). My husband eventually spotted the entrance and we walked right in. We were seated immediately and our waiter greeted us in no time. So far, so good, right? 



We were automatically given two glasses of water and chips and salsa. The water tasted gross and dirty. After one sip, I pushed it to the side. The chips and salsa were okay. The waiter recommended some kind of fruit infused water and then walked away. Hey, what about my drink order? I grew thirstier and thirstier after munching on chips and salsa while waiting on our waiter to come back. Finally, he returned and instead of taking our drink order, asks if we've decided on what to eat. Fine. I ordered the cheese enchiladas ($9.50), with a Coke please. My husband ordered Steak al Cilantro ($26.50). 



The food came out pretty quickly, but the visual presentation for both our entrees was seriously lacking. The cheese on my enchiladas looked like it had been sitting out for a while. The red sauce looked and tasted like it came from a can. I am a mediocre cook at best, and I could have made better enchiladas.The rice was bland and flavorless and was NOT Mexican rice by my standards. The refried beans tasted too meaty. The enchiladas were lackluster but I ate them anyways. Sigh.     



My poor husband's steak looked like slop. According to the menu, the steak was ""topped"" with green tomatillo sauce. My ass. That shit was drenched in it. My husband said all he could taste was that sauce. Other words he used to describe his meal were ""worst steak in my life"" and ""the first bite was pure fat that I chewed for 5 minutes"". Needless to say, he sent it back. 



Our waiter had gone MIA and never bothered to check on us after dropping off the food. The general manager is the one who actually checked on us and sent back the plate. She was totally cool about the whole thing. She recommended  the Cochinita pork tacos ($9.50), so he went with that. 



In the meantime, we were also waiting on refills. The waiter was still missing. When the GM returned with the pork tacos, we asked HER if we could get refills. My husband said the pork tacos were just okay.  



At this point, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The waiter with the disappearing act returned to clear our plates and get us our check. The final bill was a shockingly low $12.97, but that's still overpriced if I don't like the food. The manager was a sweetheart and gave me her card to let her know if I would be coming in again and if I had any comments for her. While I appreciate this gesture, we will not be returning. The food and service (the waiter) were plain bad. I was also disappointed in the so-called plethora of vegetarian options I read about in reviews. El Dorado's has the same options as any other Mexican restaurant, so don't get your hopes up.",negative
ts238,1/6/2015,revtest2302,2,"The experience inside the restaurant was great.  Food was decent, drinks were delicious (and strong), and the service was very friendly, accommodating, and fast.  The deals for locals was really good as well.  The server was very friendly and although there were some issues with the bill, it was quickly resolved without question.



I was definitely ready to call this a regular spot, but the experience was overshadowed by the OUTSIDE experience.  Firstly, as others have mentioned, it's difficult to find.  We drove to the south entrance, and was directed where to go by the attendant.  After being honked at by the various strip club clientele, we made our way to the front of the building.  



Parking was plenty and easy to find, but it's still shared with the strip club.  That also meant a visit from a golf-cart parking lot attendant, telling us we couldn't hang around there.  We had finished our meal with friends and were chatting for about 5 minutes, had the parking lot attendant attendant give us the ""you can't hang around here"" response, which we responded with a ""we're just talking with our friends"", which then resulted in a ""excuse me?  what was that?"" (ie, 'are you questioning my authority?'). Fine we get it.  



We wrapping up our goodbyes, however, that was cut short as the guy came back with a cart full of a couple girls 2 minutes later and actually almost hit my friend.  I guess - what - as a warning?  Great.  I now don't want to come back to a hidden gem of a restaurant, because some parking attendant had a power trip.

The presentation didn't make it very appetizing and the taste was bland. You should probably stay away from the pork tonkatsu because it's just a deep fried pork cutlet served with rice.

I managed to get a beef dish minus the bacon. I found it to be very salt laced ( almost too salty to be edible) as far as any other flavor development - it was non existent - what i tasted was salty beef with noodles. Pretty gosh darn awful - had i cooked this at home it would have gone in the trash.





Now for the service -my waitress was very put off when i mentioned that everything had pork and she avoided our table after this like the plague. Like we were lepurs. Had she asked me how my food was i would have told her to taste it herself and answer that question in her head. 



Thus bad service over salted food limited menue i could go on but why bother with words on a place i will not go to and steer friends clear of .

No, I'll just eat the garbage left from the folks before me..geez!! The server was very nice and accommodating however.

Please ..this idiotic staff needs some training, the cook/owner needs to taste some of the food being served.

Came to Asado specifically for the wings since they were always outstanding at Cocomo's, so I can't speak on the Mexican food part, although, the chips with the chips & salsa looked like somebody had stomped on them earlier as they were broken into tiny pieces. As for the wings, instead of 8 wings you now get 6 which are overpriced at more than a dollar a wing unless you do Happy Hour. No longer served in the kinda cool little bucket, they were wet and caked with spice, not crispy and lightly spiced like they use to be at Cocomo's. They weren't served with the good Wasabi sauce like they use to be so we had to ask for some. The waitress then brought out some sauce that was so watered down you could barely taste any Wasabi, looked like green water.

I think Tatum Ranch alone has 10k residents with basically nowhere to eat.



We've been here 3 times, all mediocre at best. Our last visit kind of sealed the deal on us never returning.



Outside patio area is nice, especially the booths! Great during nice evenings. Nonstop chips. They have really trained their servers and wait staff very well how to serve and cater to the customers. My only (weird) complaint really is that there isn't much ""personality"" amongst the employees/servers - it's obviously a very well-honed serving system that they have trained their people on, but it lacks authenticity a bit. It's not really a complaint, but it just feels a bit off I guess.



The food is pretty gross. My husband ordered the pollo fundido and the chicken MUST HAVE been frozen chicken. I could be wrong, but it tasted and looked just like that weird frozen, fake defrosted chicken color and tasted just like weird frozen defrosted chicken with the fake grill lines. It was literally inedible and gag-worthy. For a Mexican restaurant where pollo is front and center in most dishes, this is inexcusable.

Tonight, it was a bad experience - and I'm not compelled to return to Asado Mexican Kitchen again. Here's the scoop:  we went in for drinks only, and it quickly became obvious that the bartender doesn't really enjoy her job (what a difference it makes when a bartender likes his/her job!). My fiancée ordered a Cosmo, and what we got was far from any Cosmo we've ever had. It tasted like there was lots of grapefruit juice in it. Is the bartender trained for her job?



Next, we figured we'd try the draft beer ... How can you go wrong with beer? The beer was good. However, on the 3rd beer, we were served a different beer than we ordered ... that's not really a big deal, but when the bartender treats you like it's your fault and she has no remorse whatsoever, one begins to wonder.

ts241,11/8/2014,revtest2332,2,"Update 11/15: I spoke with one of the employees at the Chandler location. Turns out this Mesa location is co-owner by the one that owns the Scottsdale one and the one that owns the Chandler one. They decided to go with the Scottsdale location's pricing and sushi style/sizes... which I hope changes. I personally believe one of the big reasons the Chandler location does so well and is always packed and has regulars is because the prices and portions cannot be beat. If this Teharu wants to stand out from the other sushi places locally, pricing would be the way to go.



----



I've been to all three Teharu locations. This one is the least appealing to me overall, by far. The only thing this location outdoes the other three on is atmosphere. 



Let me start off by saying I visit the other location in Chandler twice a week. It's close to my work, the portions are great, and it has the best pricing by far. I know many of the employees by name, and my coworker and I are treated well every visit.



That being said... This location pales in comparison when it comes to price and portion. The plates are often $.50 to $1 more expensive than the Chandler location, and the portions are almost half of what I would get as well. 



The food was cold when it shouldn't have been... cold tempura shrimp rolls just aren't the same... have you had soggy tempura? It isn't very appetizing, to me anyways. 



The sauces were even different, and not in a good way. The unagi sauce was the most disappointing. It tasted like they grabbed some soy sauce and tried to water it down with just a little eel sauce... too salty!



Pros: Closer to my house by about 20 miles, great atmosphere, good service (until there are more than five tables seated), and informative staff.



Cons: Smaller meals (so you have to eat more, and therefore spend more), higher prices (again, spending more), sauces are lacking, and food that isn't fresh enough.



Overall, I won't go out of my way to go back. I spent the same amount of money as I would have going to a regular sushi bar that would have served fresh food and given me a free miso soup and salad. 



That being said, I will give Teharu a second and third chance when it picks up business and gets its big kid wings, maybe things will change.",negative

That being said,  Charlies consistently provides some of the worst coffee and customer service I have ever experienced at a coffee shop.  The only reason I ever purchase anything at Charlies is out of absolute desperation. 



I'm constantly amazed at how bad the coffee is.  They use a  decent brand for beans,  so either the beans are old or the espresso and coffee machines have never been cleaned.  The drinks taste bitter and burned in a way even the darkest roast should not.  It is worse than break room coffee at a government job (which is to say that it is also worse than no coffee). 



The fresh pastries are average,  and I appreciate the effort to have gluten free and vegetarian meals.  I have never had any of the sandwiches so I cannot speak to all of the food.  It would be wonderful to have some healthier snacks but that is probably asking too much. 



The service is the true reason for the single star.  I cannot understand why there is only one person working during their busiest hours.  It regularly takes more than 15 minutes to get through a 3 person line,  and that does not count the time it takes to get your drink. Some of the employees are very rude,  and sneer at simple requests like for hot water or ice in your personal cup. Other employees who are more courteous are constantly overwhelmed by the amount of customers during peak hours. 



Oh,  and the hours? Who knows what the are. I think they close at four, which is way too early for a LAW SCHOOL coffee shop where caffeine is in higher demand than adderall.

I've been trying to save #500 for a noteworthy contestant, but I haven't quite ran into anything outstanding for a few months :(



With that being said, my neighborhood bar/lounge recently had ANOTHER restaurant ownership change, and since it wasn't on Yelp yet, I figured I would do the honors....too bad, it's not a very positive review.



First of all, the main reason I believe they continue having issues with the restaurant side of their business is the fact that the interior shares a half-wall with the neighboring bar which allows cigarette SMOKE to linger. It's not nearly as noticeable today in comparison to the pizza restaurant that resided a couple months ago due to the fragrant meats and sides, but still bothersome to most non-smokers.



Before I start on the food, let me first point out that this is GOOD BAR FOOD...just not great BBQ.  Let me clarify, if I was sitting at the bar watching the game, I'd be hard pressed to find much better bar counter food ordering selectively from the menu.  But compare this to the better BBQ spots in town, and you'll leave unimpressed...especially given their price point.



I ordered the Combo Platter: ""Sweet"" Ribs, Pulled Pork, Smoked Beans & Mac Salad. Ribs were TERRIBLY OVERCOOKED, blackened crispy & dry. Bones were BRITTLE & actually BROKE APART when given little effort. The Pulled Pork was good though, crunchy bits and smokey undertone, with the only complaint being the sauce too SWEET for my tastes. Smoked beans were a nice change from the norm, but the mac salad was forgettable.



Also tried the Chopped Brisket, Baked Beans & Coleslaw. Brisket was DROWNED in sweet bbq sauce that masked all the smokey flavor that was hiding inside. Beans were run-of-the-mill but enjoyable.  Coleslaw tasted like raw cabbage and water.  Where is the vinegar...sugar...flavor? 



And last but not least, the Fried Pickles. Some pieces were a bit salty and overcooked, but most were tasty and well done. 



To summarize, if you are in the area looking for a good place to watch the game & some good bar food (and don't mind the smoke), this would be an great choice given what we have in the Northwest.  If you are looking for the best BBQ in Vegas, you won't find it here.",negative
ts245,12/8/2014,revtest2344,2,"I have been in Austin for the past few months for work and I was tempted by this new BBQ place in the wilds of the Northwest. I came in today, ordered chopped brisket because sliced was unavailable and had the pulled pork. The pulled pork was terrible. Dry, chopped instead of pulled, drenched in a poor quality sauce. I did not enjoy it. The brisket was OK, the only part of the experience deserving any stars, but drenched in BBQ sauce. In Texas they let you add your own sauce. I feel like they were compensating for poor quality preparation. The Cole slaw was dry, the dressing was watery and pooled at the bottom of the cup. The baked beans had little flavor and were too soft from being cooked too long. Not worth the price at all. Go to Road Kill just a mile or so away to get something amazing, twice the food at the same price and as good as anything I have had in Texas.",negative
ts245,12/8/2014,revtest2345,2,"Why? Why? Why...can we not get more solid BBQ here? Has Vegas been cursed by some sort of barbecue hating devil? Have the BBQ Gods no mercy on Sin City? I really just don't get it. But before I self-explode, let me explain...



Bubba D's is a brand new BBQ joint located inside the Town Center Lounge on Sky Pointe, just off Ann & the 95. I'm not super familiar with this lounge, but I do know from driving by it everyday that the restaurant inside has seen its fair share of changes. Not long ago, a breakfast place used to be here that I had bookmarked, and never got to try. According to Bubba D's, they shut down due to allowing guests under 21 to dine-in. Because they share the space with a lounge who's ceilings are 28 feet high, and it's way ""too expensive"" for them to legally block off the area, this is strictly a 21 and over spot. So, for families with children, you're stuck with takeout only. I don't want to fault them much for the location, as I'm sure they're just working with what they can, but I really question why a BBQ joint would pick this spot. Even if I had been at this bar drinking beforehand, I'm not sure I would've wanted to spend that much money on what is technically just bar food. 



Much like other bars, the menu is larger, this one just focuses on BBQ. Obviously there's classic choices like meat plates and sandwiches, but they also have some unique items like giant potatoes, tacos and even burritos. Tons of sides are available, although some are only available a-la carte, and there's a separate ""To Go By The Pound"" menu as well. In my opinion, pricing is flawed and kind of all over the place. A 1/2lb of brisket alone starts at $10, yet a burrito or potato that they proudly display as weighing over 1lb, with brisket, is only $12. Sure, there's other ingredients in these, but how small are they making the meat portions? And because sides are separate, most of which you can not order with the combos, the bill can get rough. We only ordered 2 combo plates with 1 dessert, no drinks or extras, and our to-go bill was just a few cents under $40. I have no problem paying for good BBQ, we all now how much meat is, but they've got a lot of work to do. Here's what we got...



I'll start with sides. All borderline terrible in my opinion. The coleslaw was either packaged, or made with a very generic cookbook. No flavor at all, and way too watery. Potato salad was just as bad flavor-wise, and I swear they put rosemary in it. It just didn't work. Then sadly, my most anticipated side of all was the smoked beans, and they were probably the worse. I had to scoop some up to take the photo, but most of the container was liquid. And that liquid tasted like straight up smoke water. Imagine taking a cup of water and leaving it in a smoker for hours upon hours, then sipping on it. I love me some smokey flavor, but whoa!



Hoping the meat would make up for the lackluster sides, we dug in, and were let down with just about everything. I ordered a 2 meat combo with chopped brisket and sausage, Lore ordered a 2 meat with ribs and pulled pork. They don't offer a classic hot link, but do have locally sourced sausages made just for them. My pick for the sausage was jalapeño, and tasted like just about nothing. It was drowned in sauce, which is most likely why, but I'll get back to the sauce. Both the brisket and pulled pork seemed to be smoked great. The meat wasn't overly smokey, you could taste a bit of seasoning in them, and they were tender with nice little crispy burnt-endish pieces. Unfortunately, the ribs were probably the worst of all. I'm no smoking expert, but they seemed to be cooked at too high of a temperature, way too fast. The outside was burnt black, yet parts of the inside seemed undercooked. It had a raw meat look and texture. And I'm not talking about the pink from smoke rings. 80% of the rack got trashed. 



But here's the thing, I can honestly say this was my first ever backwards BBQ experience. In most cases, the meat at joints is what's lacking, but you can get enough sauce on them to make it taste okay. But Bubba D's is the only place I've been too where it was the complete opposite, and I wished there was no sauce on most of the stuff, like the brisket and sausage. This sauce is bad. Really bad. I'm not sure if the photos will do it justice, but the only thing I can compare it to is some sort of old, canned marinara/pizza sauce. It's thick, it's tomatoey, and it seriously ruined every piece of meat on all our plates. The ribs couldn't be saved, so that's another story. But I'm not even sure what sauce we got either. We weren't offered a choice (even though there's 3 on the menu), and we attempted to get as much of it off the meat before we ate to try figuring it out. 



I hate giving places like this such a bad review, but this was just bad food. The friendly owners and service is worthy of 2 stars, but I can't say the same for the eats.",negative
ts245,12/27/2014,revtest2346,2,"Dissapointing. Seeing the smoker outside we had high hopes for this new BBQ joint, boy were we let down. Meats were all overdone and dry. Beware, the meats come smothered in sauce. You have to ask for no sauce so you can sauce your own. The sauces were mediocre. My ribs were hard on the outside and not in a good way. 

 Ordered both the regular and jalapeño corn bread. The regular was like a crumbly dense flavorless cake. The jalapeño was the exact same piece with a whole jalapeño cooked on top. Come on, take the time to slice up the jalapeño and mix it with some roasted corn into the batter. It tasted like Jiffy cornbread mix.

 The beans were ok. They were a bit overdone but had chunks of meat for flavor which redeemed them a little bit. The potato salad was the best thing about my dinner, on par with a store deli counter salad, didn't taste homemade. 

 The waitress was sweet and I hope she finds a new job soon. I can't see this place lasting much longer. Sad because Vegas needs more good BBQ.",negative

""Fuck. Alright, fine. I'll give it a shot.""



I should have listened to the side that wanted to go to Crisp. You walk into 7th Steet Market and the first thing that will probably cross your mind is: wow this place looks like a giant Subway. I mean, seriously, the furniture is old and kinda beat up to crap, the menu is unoriginal and it just looks like a bunch of shit has been thrown together to look like a deli. In short, it has no character.



On the plus side, the service is great and the Greek Salad with chicken that I ordered was very good. They pre-make the salad veggies and leave them in the case, but the chicken itself was freshly grilled and came with a really nice Greek dressing with chunks of feta cheese.



Having said that, Adams 7th Street Market is not my jam. They're just slapping together some Boar's Head meats and cheeses and throwing them onto bread; you might as well go to Harris Teeter if that's what you're looking for. However, if it's more your kind of thing and you want to support local business, then I would recommend it. Oh, and the prices are pretty reasonable.",negative

Also one last tip, I learned that you can request lunch portion on pretty much ANYTHING on their menu, even the chef's special, so make sure you ask for it if you don't want as big of a portion, it'll save you a good $2 or so on each item. Lastly, try their beef chow fun, OMGGG, awesome. Not the best I've ever had but out of all the entrees I tried from this restaurant, they nailed the beef chow fun.

Ordering online has also been a god-send since you don't have to fumble through asking about specials, etc.  Just click away - the hardest part:  getting everyone to agree on toppings.  It does help a lot that you can half pizza toppings to appease everyone.



Great for feeding a lot of people fast - and easy too... it's pizza... no need to break out silverware!",positive

And whoa, explosion in my mouth (or a slight clog in my arteries) I felt it. But that's all good, the lettuce and tomato was there to kind of open those arteries.

They had more of a variety and larger containers of juice than my local Bruegger's does.  I got my usual sausage, egg, and cheese on a blueberry bagel.  Very good!  Plenty of Christmas cheer in terms of decor and special gifts available.  If I lived nearby I'd go there again.  :)",positive
ts11,1/22/2012,revtest2407,4,"Being from New York, I grew up on bagel's similar to how many southerners grew up on biscuits.  So, I was more than relieved to discover that this Bruegger's was in the area and not far from my residence.  



Though I've had their bagel lunch sandwiches on many occasions, lately I seem to get there in the morning hours for breakfast - especially on the weekends.  I usually go with the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a bagel of my choosing  Their bagels are all good to me, so I usually make my decision based upon what is hot at that particular time - just look for the signs on the bagel bins. 



It has been my experience that a slight crowd can develop here later in the mornings usually between 10 - 11am, so I usually try to get there before then.  But even if you get stuck in a bit of rush - no worries!  The attendants are usually very prompt in their service and get you in and out as quickly as possible.  There is plenty of parking in the plaza and as another reviewer has stated, once upon a time they had free wi-fi though I do not know if this is still the case. 



If you live anywhere in north Charlotte or near the University Area, I really do not know where you are going to find a better bagel option than Bruegger's.  If you are an implanted northerner as many of us are, and you suddenly have a craving for a taste of home, Bruegger's is definitely a viable option.",positive

The bagels are fresh and they usually have hot bagels right out of the oven and a wide variety to choose from. I usually don't stray away from my personal favorite everything bagel with an odd combination of two cream cheeses.The light garden veggie and lox cream cheese are both delish. If you're looking for something different you  try the jalapeno cream cheese. 

Everyone from Mary who usually rings me up to the guys who make the bagels.

I like the different types of bagels and spreads. 



The place is always clean and there are a few tables and booths. 

Whenever I'm craving a carb-filled breakfast on the run I grab a bagel and my day starts off well!  $2.50 for a cream cheese bagel, my coffee is more!",positive

They do have live music intermittently on weekends, but it is much more a sports bar than live music venue.



My band performed there in May, during the NBA Finals. We were slated to go on at 10, after the first game but before the second game came on, which meant they would turn down the sound on the TVs. I thought we were going to get bum-rushed when some people learned what was going on. 



It turned out okay in the end, but it was an interesting evening to say the least.



Food-wise, the pizza and wings are delicious! I had excessive quantities of both, as well as draft beer.



Apart from the sports crowd, it seems this place does quite a bit of late-night business, as a lot of people make it one of their last stops of the evening before heading home to sleep it off.



Overall, a good scene, and definitely worth a stop just for the pizza and wingies.",positive

I had the Southwest Chicken Salad, others had the Manhattan Pizza.

My salad was fresh and flavorful. The personal pizza was excellent as well.



They also have NTN trivia if you like playing on-line.

Luckily we both had cash on us so we just left it on the table.



Service aside, we didn't eat any food so I may come back here to try that out - maybe not on a football night.  There are plenty of screens and TVs all around the Bar and dining area so everyone had a decent view of the screens - I could see it as a fun place to go and watch games.  I think my friends and I just wanted to check in on the score, but didn't think the bar was going to be so charged up.  There were some die-hard Giants and Cowboys fans in there.  We left during the half since it felt like a fight was going to break out at any second.

ts12,8/21/2011,revtest2422,5,"This is a perfectly awesome sports bar.



You can go there for any big game for any sport, and they will have it on one of their many screens WITH SOUND!!  They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.



I recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  



My only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.



If your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. 



Before I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not ""5-star"" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.

The service at Picasso's is good, but it's not A) a family restaurant, B) a frozen drink/flair/appletini bar, or C) a 'College' bar.

Great atmosphere, very friendly and attentive bar tenders, and pleanty of TV's with a wide variety of sports shown.  Just what I was looking for.  Oh yeah, the A/C worked perfectly too. 



I had a pizza while watching two baseball games and the golf tournament. The pizza was pretty good, not great, but I ate it all so it was good enough.  Great crust.  The menu seemed to have some other things that looked good. I heard somebody down the bar mention the Calzone was good so next time.  Another guy had some good looking wings too.

Stopped there in the daytime once however to pick up some of the aforementioned deliciousness, and was put off by their carpet in the morning.  If you've had a bit to much too drink, don't stare at the carpeting while making your way to the loo.  You might fall over.

But I am a huge fan of wings, and thus I sought out a place that had pretty decent ones.  This led me to try Picasso's to see what it's all about.  And I have got to say, they have some pretty good ones.



Thus far, I have tried three different kinds.  The Caribbean Creepers were like eating a jerk chicken wing, but they were just a little too different for me.  The medium garlic were pretty good, but the best I have had, by far, are the Cajun Garlic.  They are the perfect level of spiciness, not too spicy but plenty of flavor.  



I have tried some of their other things here too.  Their bacon cheese fries were kind of 'meh' when I had them; they were pretty skimpy on the cheese and bacon.  Their pizza was pretty decent.  We had the Masterpiece, had a lot of good toppings.  Still, I am not a huge fan of New York-style pizza (I originate from the Midwest, and am quite partial toward Chicago-style or deep dish), but it was pretty standard for pizza.



Service has been ok here.  I have never had bad service, so that is definitely a plus.  They do have a decent amount of seating too, and it's not overly crowded in there.



I plan to try a few more things on their menu, and that definitely includes other styles of their wings.  Their wings are good, but I must continue on my quest for amazing wings here in Charlotte.

It is a great place to watch whatever game you want because they have tons of TVs as well as the largest projection TV I have seen thus far in Charlotte.  I have only tried the wings and the pizza and they are definitely on point.  The pizza is oven baked, so it has a unique taste that only Picasso's can provide.  I would give it five stars if the service was a little more consistent.  Sometimes you will sit down at a table and it takes forever for someone to come over, while at other times the service is stellar.

Everyone's been to a sports bar before, this was a little strange to me. None the less we found seats close to the big screen. It seems like there's thousands of tv's in this place! I think there were only two servers working that day. But they had it all under control. It's kind of a do as you please atmosphere. Everyone had on a jersey representing their team, it was live! I ordered the two foods their known for. Pizza. Wings. I had a medium cheese pie and the cajun garlic wing basket (or whatever it's called). The pizza, not really all that great. It was just a step up, maybe two, from frozen pizza. ( Our waitress noted that the dough is made in house dailey). Just didn't hit the spot for me. The wings on the other hand...marvelous! I don't know if I'd say the best in Charlotte, but they were pretty good! Sadly when I got to the bottom of my wing baskey ( because I ate all of them), my very last wing had a rather large feather still attached. This rendered it inedible in my book. Overall great spot.

This time I tried the Pineapple Kicker Wings. I was thinking they would be a little more sweeter with the name ""Pineapple"" and all, instead they are more on the spicer side. The bf had Hot Garlic. They too were on the spicer side instead of really tasting the garlic. All in all the wings were still good and now you can get a basket which comes with six wings and a nice size helping of French Fries for $7.99. Before you would have had to add a side of fries. They also have really good drink specials: $2.50 draft beers and $9.00 pitchers. The appetizers of my choice is the Spinach Artichoke Dip and the Pepperoni Pizza Rolls...I wouldn't recommend the  Fried Jalapeño  b/c when I had them they were kinda mushy and I actually prefer them with cream cheese instead of a nacho cheese filling.

ts12,7/21/2014,revtest2449,4,"I have been eating and playing poker at Picasso's for over a year now . . . and at the Uptown location for longer than that.

I should say that I'm not a sports fan . . . I come here to play poker and spend time with my poker buddies a couple of nights a week. BUT, for those who are sports fans and like to eat/drink while watching a game,  you should be very happy with this place.

Picasso's is very popular with the college-aged sports fan crowd -- particularly since it's located just up the road from UNC-Charlotte.

The food is standard sports-bar fare. Wings, pizzas, sandwiches, wraps, fries and other appetizers. These are of fairly average quality -- though I have heard some of my friends comment that they particularly like the fajitas. There are no desserts.

There is a good selection of beer & mixed drinks -- nothing fancy, but adequate and fairly priced for your average sports fan.

The staff is very friendly and professional and are able to accomodate large crowds with ease -- given a little advanced notice. As I mentioned, my poker league plays here twice a week (on Mondays and Wednesdays, 2 games each day at 7pm and 9:30pm FREE) and we usually have crowd of 20-30. Often, other college groups (clubs, fraternities, sports teams, etc.) share the same space.  It's a spacious establishments with lots of TVs and even a huge (I'd say 10 ft or bigger) projection TV for the big games.



In addition to the games on the TVs and twice-weekly free poker, there is also an electronic darts board and a ""shuffleboard"" game. The covered outdoor seating area is convenient if you happen to be a smoker or have smokers in your party. 



SO . . . being a foodie, I'd give Picasso's 3 stars. Since this place is a SPORTS BAR, however, and judging it on its' own merits, I'll give Picasso's 4 stars!",positive

Service?  Top notch.  The bartender was ON - never missed a beat, never left our glasses empty, and was very helpful.  5+ stars.



Drinks? Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.



Food? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  



For our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  



Our dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.  The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you're a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick.  Really, really good.



So, we'll definitely be back - I'm becoming a huge fan of the ""local"" places, and the Village Green is definitely a ""local"" place.  I can't wait to try a burger or to enjoy some of their other drink specials.

To us, the Village Green is the place we go when we want to get out of the house for a drink and some company. Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. 



The Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar.

Enough menu items that you have a small choice, but not so many as you will want more than one thing. The menu boasts fried chicken, country fried steak, mashed potatoes, and the like. $5-8 for lunch or dinner. ... Undecided on the employees' denim overalls and bright red t-shirts...",positive

The menu is limited, and specials change from day to day, but you can expect to find fried chicken, pork tenderloin, meatloaf, Salisbury steak, and beef Stroganoff, pot roast and other Midwestern standards. Mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans, and corn accompany. They have excellent rolls and serve them with a squeeze dispenser of apple butter, making them ridiculously addicting.



The eponymous and enormous apple dumplings are divine. Save room, you will not regret it. They are essentially cored apples, stuffed in cinnamony goodness, wrapped in flaky pie crust and baked. They are worth a trip in and of themselves.



The decor seems a bit odd, but is well-suited to the restaurant. Country effects and pictures of family worthy of awkwardfamilyphotos.com adorn the walls. The walls are light, and the fluorescent lights are bright. Do not expect an intimate or quiet meal, but this works as this is primarily a breakfast and lunch joint (traditionally, farm families eat the biggest meal of the day at noon, and call it dinner, with supper in the early evening). The dining area can be crowded and loud, and there is a huge open entryway into the kitchen, so the curious can literally monitor everything that goes on in the restaurant. All this fits, however, as this is restaurant's honesty is bared for all to see and what is revealed is pure.



What separates the Apple Dumpling from other restaurants is not just the menu items and decor, it is the sense of family. Servers, cooks, and other staff are clearly all from the same extended family and/or social group (probably the church across the street). If you happen to be of Midwestern stock they will serve you food that is exactly like what your mother and grandmother made, and that is a big compliment in my book.

My Advice: Go on a Friday or Saturday night, when you can get a Twice-Baked Potato



I have been living in the C-U area for a little over 2 years now and I made my first visit to The Apple Dumplin' just 3 nights ago. We absolutely loved it! Enough so that we went again last night. 



Their twice-baked potato was fantastic, one of the best potatoes I've ever eaten. The only bad thing it that they only serve it on Friday and Saturday nights, so if you go any other time, you're SOL. 



On our first visit, my son, my step-daughter-to-be and I all got beef and noodles. The children's version is served with mashed potatoes on the side, while the full-size meal is served over a bed of mashed potatoes. It was delicious and also very filling. Even though it was the nightly all-you-can-eat meal, I was only able to eat one plate. My fiance ordered fried chicken and it was very good. Lightly breaded and juicy, just the way fried chicken should be. 



On our second visit I got the all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp, the Saturday night special. Paired with the twice-baked potato, my meal was excellent. This was no tiny, marble sized shrimp; they were plump and perfectly fried. Not to mention, all-you-can-eat shrimp for only $8.75? Are you kidding me? My fiance got the beef and noodles, which was just as tasty as the first time. The kids got chicken strips and fries, which were just what you would expect, but the portions were huge. 



The staff is very friendly and they remembered us from the first time we were there. Our waitress even commented that my son had gotten a haircut in between. The salad bar is nothing super special, but it's adequate. I loved the cucumber salad and the kidney bean salad. 



Almost everything made here is done so from scratch. I don't know if the popcorn shrimp was, but the beef and noodles, fried chicken and mashed potatoes definitely were. According to the menu we brought home, they peel about one ton of potatoes a week. The homemade rolls are heavy and very good. Even better, they have apple butter in a squeeze bottle right at the table. I could almost make an entire meal of their rolls with apple butter. 



The only bad thing about The Apple Dumplin' is their location. They are located a few miles outside of town in the last place you would expect a restaurant to be. There is a reason it took me so long to come here....... because I didn't even know about it. We found it quite literaly by accident.",positive
ts14,8/24/2010,revtest2492,3,"Someone told me that I absolutely HAD to try this place before graduating from U of I. That being said, I spent about half an hour trying to find this place. Walking in with my boyfriend (who is half Mexican, half Greek and very dark), the stares made it obvious that he was the most exotic being to ever step foot in the place. The food was alright, not good enough to justify getting lost trying to find it for thirty minutes. Call me a simple gal, but give me the Cracker Barrel over this place any day.",negative
ts14,11/8/2010,revtest2493,4,"Apple Dumpling is about 10-15 minutes outside C-U proper, on the wild edges of town, and it's a plain, unassuming little spot.  It will serve you the friendliest of calorie-laden, heart-attack inducing greasy breakfasty diner foods and the like, and for that you must love it a little bit.  The country kitsch works here, and is worth a stop in.  I really did enjoy their biscuits and gravy for breakfast, which are filled with carbs and fat and love and all that one can ask for in Middle America.



Their Sunday buffet is a little disappointing as it lacks any breakfast options, but the fried chicken is spot on.  It's worth coming once for the kitsch, twice for the biscuits and gravy.  Then you go to the gym and cry salty, buttery tears on your treadmill.",positive

The breakfast menu was limited and not very appealing.  The coffee was okay.  I ordered the Giant Cinnamon Roll but was told they were out.  This was at 9:00 AM.  How do you run out with two hours left of breakfast?   I then ordered the Loaded Omelet.  It was, indeed, loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, veggies, and cheese.  It needed some seasoning and a bit more flavor but wasn't that bad.  On the side was fried potatoes and gravy.  It was good, but my doctor would kill me if she saw me eating that.  Definite artery clogger.  In all it wasn't bad but also not someplace I'd return, even to taste the elusive cinnamon roll.  



NOTE: There are references in the other reviews that hint at prejudice, such as ""be stared at for your entire meal if you happen to not be Caucasian.""   While I was there, a black couple came in and seemed to be known by the staff and was greeted warmly.  An interracial couple later came in.  I saw no ""staring"" or any such behavior.",negative
ts14,4/23/2012,revtest2496,5,"Probably the best place in the area to get a taste of what people were eating in central Illinois 50 years ago.  The beef and noodles (all you can eat on Thursday) are exactly like what my great grandma used to make us, and the biscuits and gravy always take me back to mornings before fishing.  



Be warned-the Apple Dumpling doesn't pull its punches.  The food is not healthy-it was designed for farm laborers, not office dwellers (or tractor riders), and is consequently heavy, hearty, and massively caloric.  You might think that some of the noodles are underdone.  You are wrong.  The noodles are made to different thicknesses on purpose, and some of them need to have more texture.  If nothing else, think of it as proof that a person made your food, not a factory.



Here's the skinny (irony!).  If you grew up in the midwest, you'll know what's going on with one bite.  If you're from some other place, give it a taste and expand your horizons, but check your baggage at the door.  Like it or not, you'll leave a more cultured person.",positive

MY only complaint is that there was not room on my plate by the time I got back to sitting down and coul not try everything. You will walk out of there feeling you have had an amazing home cooked meal and you will not need to eat any more. Congrats to Jim and Kathie for providing and outstanding venue for people who want to eat the real deal..  This will definitely be added to our list of recommended pla",positive
ts14,5/26/2014,revtest2498,5,"We came in for a nice family dinner this past Saturday. It was absolutely delicious. The prices are very fair too.

I had an amazing BLT. It was perfect. Everyone else enjoyed their food, the menu is rather small, but everything is good! I think between the 9 of us, we tried everything on the menu.

The salad bar is nice, everything looked fresh.

The service is great, everyone is friendly.



But...the high light of the meal, was DESSERT. This is not a place to skip dessert. I don't care if you are counting calories, today is the day to cheat on that diet!! The apple dumplings, are just amazing. I don't usually go for desserts, figured I'd have a bite or two of my husbands though. Well, a bite or two turned into me eating at least half of his apple dumpling, even though I was full already! It is that good. 

I want the recipe!",positive
ts15,8/15/2007,revtest2499,5,"Tonight, I cheated on Eliana's with Guanaquito. I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me? 



If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.



Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. 



For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. 



The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.



I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too. Hubby and I got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!).",positive
ts15,2/20/2008,revtest2500,4,"Guanaquito's was a place my GF found out about through someone at work, and she dragged me along. I was skeptical, but optimistic. I have lived in Panama and Guatemala, and I was looking forward to some basic C.A. farmer food.



I was not disappointed. My stewed chicken was excellent. We ordered an appetizer platter: starch as far as the eye could see. They even had yucitas (casava fries). In Panama, we joked  about yuca being the potato's drier, stringier cousin. But Guanaquito's yucitas brought back fond memories of the campo and drunken evenings sitting in Pio Pio in David. A mixed message for most, I'm sure, but for me it was all good.



The staff was awesome, explaining for us gringos how to enjoy the fare. And we did enjoy. I'm looking forward to making my way back sometime soon.",positive

He answered for her that they do so I told them I would return. I was early in meeting Amanda B. and Kevin H. so I parked myself at a table. I speak Spanish, does it say that some where on my forehead??? People seem to just ""KNOW"" this for some reason. Even when I responded in English they continued to speak Spanish to me here. I finally gave in and went with it, the girl said ""Ah so you do speak Spanish"" like it was some sort of test. She was very polite she did not speak English though and I basically translated for everyone throughout the meal. I have not had El Salvadoran in a really long time so I don't really have anything to compare. I deducted a star because everything had pork bits in it except the salsa and tortillas. I would go again if I was in the area, next time I will clarify no meat when I order.



Bean & Cheese Pupusa - awesome very good minus the pork

Chile Relleno - very good, totally different than Mex. on the inside it was stuffed full of pork, potato and carrots among other stuff it reminded me of a stew minus the liquid.

Horchata - Fresh from scratch very very delicious and sweet sugar high achieved



I would like to try the soups they looked good and a little pricey.

Actually, many firsts tied to this visit to Guanaquito; first mid-week lunch date, first time having Salvadorian food, first ensalda and my first pupusa. Our drink order was taken and I tried the ensalada this was a sweet and refreshing citrus drink with small pieces of pineapple and papaya this was a perfect drink on a hot day. For an appetizer we tried the pupusa which are fabulous handmade tortillas that are stuffed with a variety of fillings, sampled the pork, cheese and bean - outstanding. For my entrée I had the Chile relleno. Hands down the best relleno I have ever tried. This version was stuffed with carrots, potato, pork and cheese simply scrumptious.

I had the plato tipico, which I think translates as, ""giant plate heaped with fried deliciousness.""  In fact, the pictures posted here are actual photo documentation of what I had, while dining with Brian G.



The yucca fries were utterly divine -- crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, slightly sweet throughout. The pupusas, pure awesomness (and I've had my share, believe it or not). The empanadas, pretty tasty, but not mind-blowing. The tamale, I could have lived with out.

The pupusas are cooked to a perfect crisp on the outside. The inside is warm with meat and cheese. Even the rice and beans are great.

I had papusas and a random sampler - and my favorite fried plantain with beans and sour cream. 



This was good - better than Eliana's yes - but both are pretty damn good. And i felt like this place was Phoenix - super seedy exterior, lots of espanol, and good food in a strip mall - Phoenix to a tee.",positive
ts15,1/28/2009,revtest2507,4,"I came here based on reviews comparing it to Eliiana's, considering I had never even seen it (it's pretty well hidden). And my philosophy is, any place with papusa deserves a shot. 



Me & my BF went at around 7pm, and parked in the back. It felt a little creepy, but still...papusas are calling, so we entered. 



It's a no frills establishment, with a larger variety of foods and papusas than Eliana's. We shared the sampler (for comparisons) and some chicken leg entree...it really wasn't all that interesting. 



The sampler plate was pretty similar to Eliana's, but they give you more (for more money, of course). The papusas, however, were the bomb (do people still use that term? Bomb?). WAAAAY better than Eliana's. And I'm told the ensalda drink was WAAAAY better too, but that is not my cup 'o tea. The tortillas served with the main entree were a little dry, so I'm siding with Eliana's tortillas. Serves was friendly, but not quite the waitress type service you get from Eliana's. We ordered up front, and then sat down. Then the food was brought to us. 



So basically, I still like Eliana's more for their main dishes and tiny cup of chicken soup. But I'll come here for papusa lunches....many of them. 



Oh yeah!",positive
ts15,2/23/2009,revtest2508,5,"A Salvadorean friend recommended this place to us when she found out that we love papusas.

ts15,4/12/2009,revtest2509,5,"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?"" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. 



Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better.",positive

We live within walking distance of the place, and honestly, from the front of the building facing McDowell it looks like nothing at all. I would see this place driving by and be like"" How the hell does a restaurant survive there?"". Thankfully, I ran along the place on Yelp! 



Wow. I can't believe I was not more daring before now. I got 4 pupusas to go for my husband and me. While waiting, I noticed that the place is very clean and reminds me a lot of some restaurants in Mexico (although not a Mexican restaurant). 



The man who took my order and money was very nice and he explained how to put the sauce and slaw on them if I so wished. I didn't like the sauce or slaw once I tasted them but, who cares, you don't need it. 



We got the pork and cheese pupusas and they were out of this world! So fresh and yummy. Two pupusas each was a nice little lunch along with a beer (at home). The place needs to get beer is the only thing lacking!

ts15,6/22/2009,revtest2512,4,"3.5 stars rounded up.  Our first foray into Salvadoran cuisine.  Half the fun was working out what we wanted with our poor Spanish and the servers poor English.



We weren't very hungry since we had been to Lo-Lo's just a short time before.  The plan was to share 2 entree's between the four of us at Lo-Lo's and then finish our dinner at Guanaquito.  Well, two plates  at Lo-Lo's and the four of us were nearly full.



So we didn't order much at Guanaquito.  Four pupusas:  cheese, bean & cheese, pork and beef.  They were all very good.  I enjoyed the grilled flavor of the bread very much.  Having each bite with cabbage and some hot sauce was tasty indeed.



We also tried some fried yucca.  It was OK but very much like thick cut french fries.",positive
ts15,7/1/2009,revtest2513,4,"This was my first venture into Salvadoran cuisine, and what a great place to be exposed to it. This place is so authentic, they barely speak any English. Luckily, I was able to use my decent (although far from fluent) Spanish to ask what things were and get the waitress's recommendations. We had the plato tradicional appetizer, a platter of Salvadoran specialties - for $9, you get two pupusas (of your choice), two beef empenada-like things, three fried yucca things, and a chicken tamale. If you want a nice exposure to different Salvadoran dishes, I highly recommend this as a meal for one or a starter for two or three. The pupusas, especially, were fantastic. Next, we had some chicken dish with onions in a gravy-like sauce--also delicious--that came with a side of rice and beans (and a ""salad"" that was just some iceberg and tomato with a wedge of lime). The refried beans were some of the best I've had. And this whole dish cost $9, if I remember correctly. I highly recommend Guanaquito to expose yourself to the authentic cuisine of El Salvador.

The menu's do explain what you are eating so no surprises.  



I got the Carne Asada plate.  The steak  was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  It came with yellow rice, beans, a salad, and tortillas.  The tortillas were thick and grilled.  I also shared a bean and cheese papusa.  The papusa was awesome basicly a tortilla stuffed with beans and cheese.  You have to try it.

Maybe it's a flavor that grows on you. Also wasn't too impressed by how clean the place felt, but the old pictures of the Valley in the 30s were pretty cool.

We immediately received chips with salsa and curtido( a type of coleslaw.) Didn't really like the curtido, lacked vinegar and some herbs.  But the chips were amazing.: warm, crispy and not greasy.  Nice start. I order the pork chop with plantain, rice mixed with frijoles and salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful, but being a really good cook of latin food I am going to make this recommendation to the cook.  Never add tomato sauce to rice because it makes the absorption of water difficult and makes the rice sticky.  Use Goya's Sason for coloring or tumeric.  That said, my significant other ordered the baked fish dish (because HE is watching is girlish figure) with plantains and salad.  He really enjoyed it.  I ordered a pupusa because I had never, ever, ever had one.  I ordered the one with pork cracklings, beans and cheese.  It was good.  By the way, both entrees can with a side order of pupusa.

I also had a cheese papusa but it was just bland.



The chips and salsa were like that of any Mexican place now, no more popcorn tasting chips. The side of Salvadorian slaw was nice.

This was my first ever experience with Salvadoran food and I was definitely not disappointed! The area is a little shady so we made it a day trip and took about half a dozen people. At first I was a little apprehensive, the area sucks and the parking lot was empty but it was a Saturday and probably between the lunch and dinner rush. In fact, by the time we were ready to leave, the place had filled up. The actual restaurant was very minimalist but clean and welcoming on the inside. The only negative I have to report (other than the neighborhood) is the language barrier and lack of service. Don't get me wrong, the server was very sweet and accommodating but there was only one, she didn't understand what we were saying most of the time, and it was hard to flag her down once it started to get busy. Only one of us had any experience with this genre of food, and although he liked Guanaquito, he said he preferred Eliana's but mostly because he said they spoke English and had a slightly better papusa. This was my first so I had nothing to compare it to, but I have to say I was very pleased. We ordered 3 plato tipico which came with papusas (we opted for all bean and cheese after reading the other Yelp reviews), a Salvadorean version of an empenada filled with meat and potatoes, yucca frita, tamales, and some slaw. We all loved it all except half our party passed on the tamales and we all agreed the pickled slaw wasn't the greatest; I would've preferred the slaw to have had more time to develop it's flavors and wilt a bit - it was also very sweet and I like my non-creamy slaws with a little more tang. We also had a side of fried plantains that were accompanied by crema fresca and beans (AWESOME!), their complimentary chips and salsa, and my kids shared the spaghetti with ablondigas. After reading all of the reviews on this place, I had planned on trying their chicken soup but I was so full I had to pass. At the end of the massive lunch we probably dropped about $12 per person, an excellent value for the amount of food we got.

I was loving the bean and cheese filled papusa and my friend was all about the tamale.  I ordered the avocado salad hopping it would be on the exotic side but it was just a standard dinner salad topped with sliced avocado. Aside from our appetizer and salad, we ordered an additional round of pork, cheese and bean papusas. All were very good and were the main reason for our visit.

When I was in highschool my loitering teenybopper friends and I used to get kicked out of here on a regular basis, but I don't hold that against them. We were idiots.



cNstuff has been around forever and is owned by the nicest family on the planet. The minute I walk in there the smell of cheese (or is it sandwiches?) makes me instantly hungry. And there is lots of cheese. 



The sandwich menu is extensive and I always have the hardest time deciding what to order. It seems like there is a new sandwich added everyday. Do I want the Doe Boy or just a plain ol' Tuna? Russian dressing or mustard? Sub roll or wheat? For extra you can get a side of chips, potato or macaroni salad (which is a little too sweet for me). There is also a plethora of little extra snacks to fill up on, candy bars, twinkies you name it. Last time in there, there was noticeably less Swedish products on the shelves which was a little sad. Maybe they weren't selling very well? They were always enjoyable to look at. 



Anyway, please stop in to this delightful little sandwich shop, you won't be disappointed.



Edited to add: German products, not Swedish. They were Umlaut-laden names so I got confused.",positive

Cheese n stuff may have a large menu with something for nearly everyone but I just can't walk in there and not order my Dough Boy. Top it off with macaroni salad and an iced tea and I'm all set.



On top of being mildly obsessed with that amazing sandwich, there's much to love in their little space. The friendly family that runs the place is always smiling and happy to see you and welcome all guests... high schoolers on their skateboards, businessmen in their Mercedes, white collar guys in their beat-up pickups...they all are mingling in that little deli. I've yet to go there, and I've been probably 20 times, and not have the owners know at least one guest by name when they walk in.



This was orignally a meat and cheese shop back in the day, hence the name, and they still have some deli products to pick up if you feel like skipping Safeway's. 



It's an old-school, quiet place. It's always nice to dine-in and enjoy the quiet atmosphere and feel like you're not in the big city for a short time. It may be hard to spot the store in that little strip mall, so just look for the Dairy Queen...it's right next to it.",positive

My co-workers and I heard about this place through a listing of 20 great American Sandwich shops and it apparently even had an Oprah mention. After seeing these glowing reviews here as well I was pretty much certain that I would be let down in some way, but its hard to even imagine the reason for the hype this place achieved.



It is an extremely tiny shop stuck at the end of the strip mall with central music. It's so tiny I've parked in front of it before and haven't even noticed it. The inside looks to have been renovated circa 1982 with faux wood paneling and shelving, and vintage boar's head advertisements that have been left to rot. The menu spread out across the entire wall on a confusing mix of chalk boards and computer print outs. The eating space is an extremely claustrophobic setup of folding tables and chairs stuck between the deli counter and the half-assed market shelves that sported international items that were mostly covered with a thick layer of dust.



The actual sandwiches, solid quality deli stuff using primarily boar's head meats and cheeses. That's it? Why would you fall in love with this place? I went with five other guys who ordered a mix of their signature sandwiches (Doughboy, Bizmark, Manhattan), and all agreed you can get a similar sandwich at grocery stores and preferred even the likes of Sack's to this place. There is just nothing inventive about the sandwiches or anything that stands out here other then the friendly Mom and Pop ownership and sweet vintage sign.",negative

 As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but I've only been able to get them at Chompie's in the valley.  There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish.

although the place may look like a total bummer inside with it's computer-paper-print outs hanging all over the wall listing their food, you can't really deny the cheesiness (oh puns) of this place. they're very friendly inside and recommended i try the corned beef sandwich with melted swiss and mustard. the bread was so soft it nearly melted in my mouth and the corned beef was top notch and not extremely fatty. it was a perfect size as well, not too big and meaty but not too scrawny. packed a lotta punch. they use boars head meats, and you can't really go wrong there.

They have a huge menu and I'm sure if you want something that's not listed, they'll make it for you. I can't remember the owners' names, but they are always friendly and happy to see you. The dining room does leave a bit to be desired so plan to take your sandwich to go - the only suggestion I'd make for cheese and stuff is perhaps tout yourself as to-go only, lose the tables altogether and make a little more room for unique German gifts and such. Perhaps add a delivery service instead? Okay, now I'm dreaming.

The service here is truly amazing, they just don't treat people like this much anywhere else.  They get to know you, they smile, wink, tell jokes, make you feel good about buying your lunch. I buy local whenever I can, and love that I can eat here before or after a little shopping jaunt to the ultra-local strip behind here that includes Halo, Frances, Red Hot Robot, Stinkweeds and Smeeks.  It's also right on the light rail.



The macaroni salad is my favorite anywhere.  I know everyone wants exactly what they want, which is often what their grandma/mom/Aunt Jenny made.  Lucky for me, this stuff tastes just like home to me. I can hardly drive by without stopping in for at the very least, a cup of macaroni salad. If I am lucky, I'm hungry, and I can get a cheese sandwich, (which is perfect in every way) or something with the Russian dressing on it.  (The Russian dressing makes me want to get naked and swim around in it.)



The weirdest thing about this place is the menu, which is on randomly placed sheets of paper hanging over the deli counter.  Do not rush, take your time.  Read it all, they don't mind.  They have a pre-printed menu, which has some (but not all) of the items on it, so you can start sorting things in your head.  The first time I went in I ordered whatever struck my fancy first, and while waiting for it to be made, I found about ten other things I might have ordered instead.",positive

The space is a blast from the past -- humble beginnings with personal family touches. The family owned and operated shop is clean and always welcoming. The clientele ranges from blue collared to white collared, high school kids to grandpas. You really can't get any local than this, people!

Cheese n' Stuff also sells a variety of Scandinavian products, likes cookies and lutefisk (whatever that is) plus lots of other foreign foods I've never heard of. If you're looking for an obscure Scandinavian food, you might want to check out this place first.

I looked at their menu and immediately saw a bunch of items that appealed to me.  I still couldn't believe I had never seen this before, especially since I'm sooooo in love with Cheese!



The poor people behind the counter must have thought I was nuts!  I get the impression they are used to people knowing what they want when they walk in the door rather than having me stare at the menu for a good 10 minutes, again.  To my credit, the only lunch meat I ate growing up was a slice of bologna once a year and I've eaten the same Subway sandwich for 20 years so this whole deli thing is new to me.  I asked about a number of sandwiches and they were very helpful in answering all my questions.  ""You can have that hot or cold"".  ""Sourdough or rye"".



I settled on  a chicken salad sandwich, surprisingly.  I usually shy away from ""salad"" sandwiches because most places use too much mayo, or there's funky ingredients like walnuts or raisins or grapes.  I was feeling mighty brave today I guess.  The sandwich was AWESOME!  Great flavor and not drowning in goo.  They have a huge selection of chips or you can try their homemade potato or macaroni salad.  



I can't wait to bring the hubby back for him to try.",positive
ts16,2/23/2011,revtest2567,4,"Sandwiches are my thing.  I want to eat as many of them as possible from as many different places as I can.  And let me tell you, there is just something about the sandwiches from Cheese 'n Stuff.



It's not big on atmosphere.  There's a deli counter and then a few picnic tables with plastic tableclothes, some shelves stocking Swedish foodstuffs for sale as well as the store's backstock of chips, soda and paper towels.  They usually have some cheesy holiday decorations out.  It's cramped and not that pleasant.  I usually get my lunches to go.



Their sandwich menu consists of about a million pages printed out from an inkjet printer and taped to the wall, along with some hokey signs that say things like ""Today's Special: So's Tomorrow.""  There's nothing slick or pretentious about it.  It's obviously just a shop owned by some guy and his wife and daughter.



So yeah.  The sandwiches.  I'm a vegetarian, and they have a simple yet elegant veggie sandwich that I find myself craving a lot.  It has cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocados, and some kind of dressing.  I get it on a wheat sub roll.  Not fancy, but oh-so-tasty.  I wish they had more veggie options, but this one satisfies me.



I bring friends who eat meat here so I can tell them to order the Doughboy and enjoy it vicariously.  Their deli meat is high quality and there are loads of options.  It looks like the sort of place my grandpa would love and I want to bring him there some day.  No one I've brought in has been disappointed.



The sides are delicious.  I am a fan of the macaroni salad and the pasta salad that has the olives and italian dressing.  If I'm feeling indulgent, I'll get a brownie, a piece of cheesecake, or an ice-cold sarsaparilla.



The lack of atmosphere doesn't bother me; my one gripe with this place is how early they close.  There have been many times I haven't gotten moving early enough and haven't been able to get there before they close, which is 4 PM.

My first visit to Phoenix, on the road with my band, I decided to explore downtown. I had a hankering for a sandwich, so I summoned the iPhone and searched Yelp! for ""sandwich"" and Cheese 'n Stuff was a mere .2 miles from where I was standing (across the street).

It's like a tiny little store (that only sells strange Norwegian candies and cookies) with a deli attached to it. It has folding tables in the center of it that are connected to one another so you can make a new friend at lunch (I guess), or have the staff stare at you while you eat (they didn't do that, but it still feels odd to eat there). The whole place is very small, and the deli area is wallpapered with sloppy white sheets of paper advertising different lunch options.



Let it be known, the food was very good. BUT, the place looks kind of dirty, and desperately needs someone to come in and make sense of it. The only issue that I took with the food was that they microwaved my hot sub. It was good, but I feel like microwaves belong at home. Just my opinion.",negative

Also grabbed a slice of cheesecake for less than $2. Everything was really fresh and the service was fast and friendly despite it being busy. There's a reason why this place has been around so long! 

They also had a full menu of sliced meats and cheeses for those who prefer making their own sandwiches at home - plus shelves of imported products, seemingly mostly from Sweden. It was nice to see some things I haven't seen since I lived in Finland.

Both Sandwiches were ample in size and more than enough for any human being. His Sicilian was monstrous. Everything tasted fresh and was FAR better than any sandwich you could get at a chain sub shop. 



We also had the house-made lemonade (delicious) and both the German potato salad and traditional American Potato salad. I wouldn't buy any of these bound salads again. The German Potato Salad tasted like warmed, thin cut red potatoes in pre-made, store bought Italian dressing. Oh and it also contained bacon bits and was very vinegary and very sweet.  The American potato salad tasted EXACTLY like the Resers  potato salad you get in your local grocer's deli or amongst the other pre-made salads. Although it did seem they mixed it with extra yellow mustard. Same tangy miracle-whippy taste - same weird texture oddly toothsome potatoes. And little bits of red bell pepper. The macaroni salad also looked the same.



They did have an interesting assortment of sodas (celery soda,anyone?) along with the usual suspects.  And if you need a meat or cheese plate or both- they do that too!

The bread and meat are to die for, so the mayo, bacon, and cheese all warmed up together just hit the spot.

It's comical to play Cricket in space, or with balloons. If that doesn't fancy you, play it straight. Or meander to the pool tables and hit some balls around.

ts17,2/26/2010,revtest2633,4,"After constantly passing the Armadillo Grill I started to wonder was it any good? So I read my fellow yelpers reviews. I was impressed with so many positive comments! I decided to go in and try it on a Wednesday afternoon. The place is pretty cool with a nice patio. The well drinks $3 not bad at all. The bartender a friendly gal name Kerri, that afternoon, who asks your name and introduces herself with confidence. The Dillo Burger and Fries I chose, was awesome! Burger was tasty, juice and fresh cooked to a perfect Medium as requested and steak fries were cooked to the perfect crispness. 

Oh yeah I'll be returning! Trying to keep myself away as I write this an it approaches happy hour now when appetizers go to half price and drinks get even cheaper, and well it is Friday! 

The only thing I don't like about the place is the number of TV screens with the off track betting results. Also the TVs are placed just a bit to high up for shorty here also.",positive

We finally decided to give it a try tonight and we were pleasantly surprised. All of the employees were extremely friendly and the service was really fast. If our glasses were less then half full our waitress would automatically bring a new soda. 



The Happy hour is a great deal.They have half price munchies and $3 well drinks. We started out with the potato skins which were good because they were made with real potatoes not like the fake looking potatoes you get at chain restaurants. For dinner I had the bar b que pulled pork sandwich and my fiance had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Both were really delicious!!



The atmosphere is fun because you can tell this is the kind of place that has ""regulars"" and where the locals hang out. Not to mention there is a TV practically every 3 feet with some sort of sport on it. 



We occasionally go to Turf Paradise but with Armadillo Grill so close maybe will start coming here to do a little off track betting. Much better food than the horse track and a lot less sweaty guys in tank tops.",positive

We started with the Artichoke Croquettes, and the Calamari as well. We were disappointed in the Artichoke Croquettes, you get 4 half Artichokes fried with alternating Marinara and this white sauce. The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce, which we used to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was your average calamari, nothing special! 



I ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger.



Not sure I will be rushing back to the Armadillo Grill, but I wouldn't say no to going back again!",negative
ts17,4/5/2010,revtest2636,5,"Oh, Armadillo Grill...you are something special.



The first time I came here it was late at night and I wasn't expecting much at all. From the outside this bar didn't really look like my style, but the moment I stepped inside, I was confused. It's had a semi-dive feel and there were a couple of really good DJs that night. I began to think that this place was going to be an alright spot to eat late at night. Then I had the food...



Two words: Fried Pickles. I've had them before at other places but Armadillo serves the best I've ever had. They were mind-boggling good! Not only were they like delicious sin in my mouth, they were also on a happy hour menu! $3.50 for an order of six! After the pickle came the chicken and I can say with confidence that it's the best chicken I've had at a bar. It doesn't matter if you get the strips or the buffalo chicken sandwich, they are both mouthwatering (writing about it right now is making me hungry). That night I left really content and sure that I would be back, and not just late at night!



Once I returned I knew I should try a few other things but I'm always compelled to get the chicken. I did manage to taste the mac and cheese (with buffalo chicken!), their wings and the chicken parm. Everything was spectacular (especially as far as pubs go)!



The staff at Armadillo Grill has always been great and I'm sure they will continue to be as I wiggle my way into becoming a regular here! Great happy hour, great food and friendly service in a really chill bar equals two huge thumbs up from me (I jammed them so they're both swollen)!",positive

Needless to say, the juicy beef, cheddar cheese and delicately fried egg sandwiched between a crisp, toasted Thomas' English Muffin, rivaled the best Pub Fare in the world.

ts17,5/25/2010,revtest2640,5,"My boyfriend (the lucky Nader A.) and I were driving past, feeling hungry and irritable late at night. We went and it looked like a standard sports bar--not the kind of place I'd usually go to, but it was late and our options were limited.



We sat down in a dimly lit booth and looked skeptically at the menu. We decided to go with the Fried Pickles, the Fingers and Fries, and the Buffalo Chicken Burger. I expected standard greasy bar food, but Holy Jesus, it was AMAZING! The fried pickles are huge and the batter is wonderful. I'll eat 3 of them (they come in orders of 6) and start feeling full. The Fingers and Fries are also great, the chicken is some of the most tender I've ever had. You can very gently pull it apart with your fingers. Absolute bliss. I think they use corn flakes or something in the batter; it's very flavorful and thick. I usually get the Fingers and Fries with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.



The Macaroni and Cheese with Buffalo Chicken is also worth stopping in for. I always have an internal battle about whether I want that or the Fingers and Fries. The waitresses are always friendly and the place isn't usually too busy. I tried branching out for the enchiladas and wasn't very impressed, but that's fine--I'll stick to what's good.

Good prices all day long, but stick around long enough and there will be some random even greater special price of the day.  Love that even on the special prices for cocktails you still get a fairly decent pour.  The patio is great at night for watching all the crazy drivers on Camelback.  Service is always pretty good, and the managers are always roaming about helping aid in good service.  They have pool tables and tons of TVs.  I've only had one thing here that I didn't like, and that was just a personal preference thing (their nachos are with the cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese) The 1/2 price munchie menu for late night is awesome.  I have a love affair with their Hummus....soooo good!!



Definitely a place to check out for sure!",positive
ts17,7/14/2010,revtest2642,5,"So... I am a little biased, being that I am a former ""Dillo"" AND I met my future husband here.  That being said, I love this place.  The staff is efficient, very friendly and a lot of fun.



The ""Dillo is a neighborhood bar and grill in the Camelback Corridor with a great menu.  They serve your typical bar food, yet better... usually with their own special spin on it.  They also have a very creative lunch and dinner menu and a specials menu that changes weekly to keep you on your toes.  



The wings are awesome!  They marinate in a spicy dry rub before frying and the sauce selections are very tasty and all homemade.  My personal favorite was the traditional buffalo sauce but the Armadillo Gold sauce is also very good.  Although it is a tough call, the Hummus & Pita is probably my favorite appetizer.  It is topped with ground cumin and smoked paprika that gives it wonderful flavor.  The best part about the wings, hummus and the rest of the ""Munchie Menu"" is that is is half price between 4-7p AND 11p-close EVERYDAY!



Some of my other favorite menu items are the Buffalo Chicken sandwich (YUM!) and Seared Ahi Tuna salad.  The Penne Pesto Cream is probably one of my favorite pasta dishes EVER.  



I can't leave a review with out mentioning the drink specials... Hello drink specials!!  Happy Hour everyday from 4-7 & 11-cl, that means $1 off all well drinks, draft and bottle beers.  Three Olives vodka specials on Mondays and Thursdays ($3.50 or $5 doubles, yum!).  There are many other drink specials you must check out for yourself.

We ordered 2 orders of buffalo wings with Armadillo Gold sauce, potato skins, hummus and fried pickles. The wings were delicious, finger tasting good! Except I didn't care for the red onions tossed on top of the wings, easily picked off, but none the less weird! I have never had a buffalo wing served with raw onions, and i'm not about to start (next time i'll ask them to leave them off-i hate to waste food=even if its just a few diced onions). The fried pickles had a delicious breading so i didn't mind that they weren't the true dill pickles i'm used too. The ranch for the pickles was a little runny, but tasty. The potato skins were also very tasty, and best part is there was little to no grease on top because I asked them to leave the bacon off. They were cooked to precision, not dry or over baked what so ever! They sure do know how to served a good drink too. The service was good, we didn't have to wait long for anything. There were a lot of of men due to the off track betting, so you can imagine the lack of women hanging out just for the fun of it. Something about old men smoking cigarettes non-stop checking out the race sheets and pissed of about dropping money in a second keeps women away, but don't let that keep you from trying this place, especially for the Happy Hour!",positive

We decided to order off their ""munchies"" menu, we ordered the salt and pepper calamari, it was cooked perfectly not too chewy and you could really taste the mix of salt and pepper...  and the mozzarella wedges were your standard fried cheese concoction served with marinara. I also ordered the wings in hot honey sauce which surprisingly were really tasty, they weren't hot at all but the sauce had a great sweet smoky flavor to it. Also some random ordered us a round of Washington apple shots so that made the food taste even better! I will def. be back to try some more food off of the regular menu.",negative

What can't I say about The Dillo? I've heard about this place for years and have only within the last year or so been in to take it for a test run to see how great (or bad) it could be. It's lived up to the hype.



The Armadillo Grill is misleading. From the outside, it isn't what you would expect. It's a sports bar with class and the food is awesome. My favorite? The fried pickles...such a guilty pleasure but I eat them with ease. The wings are also fantastic and so's the calamari.



The wait-staff are all friendly...every single person I've been served by has been attentive, friendly without being over bearing and sometimes, a big ol' smart ass (specifically Jason the bartender) which is right up my alley. 



Any place that has reverse happy hour is a winner in my book seeing as I work late most of the time and rarely get to make that 4-7 slot many places have. And the happy hour is fantastic! 



Even when I move closer to downtown, I'll still make my trip up to stop in at The Dillo....you should too!",positive

My date ordered a couple of appetizers, can't say I really care for deep fried pickles but the wings were delicious....but how can you fuck up wings.

I would have to say that I would like to give this place another ty on the food end of things. But as far as Sports bars go, this place is pretty cool, TV's could be a little bit bigger but that is a matter of opinion.

Plenty of stuff to do video games and pool to.

Overall not a bad little joint.",positive
ts17,11/20/2010,revtest2647,3,"The server was off putting, but that always happens when you wear that much mascara. 



The bf and I ate here after our hair person told us they had fried pickles.  We sat in rush over traffic after our day jobs and parked in a handicap spot in order to totally fuck with the system.  Actually, the paint was faded on the spot and we just couldn't tell either way.  We didn't get towed, but you might.



This place is bigger than you'd think and when we came in we were seating promptly by some chick whose probably a junior in high school and really proud of herself for working AND going to school AND doing yearbook AND trying out for the musical this year. 



The reason this place is worth trying is because the happy hour, as far as happy hours goes, it's pretty fucking awesome.  Half price FULL size apps is alone worth the trip.  Since they were cheap, we ordered a shit load of stuff and tried to act like we had NO IDEA how much food we were ordering, but we did.  We got the calamari, the wings, the spinach and artichoke dip and the fried fucking pickles.  We also got some beer and some Long Islands and talked about why Waterworld ruined Kevin Constner's career.  



The calamari was mediocre at best, mostly batter, but you know, it's calamari, what do you expect?  It wasn't horrible, it was edible and after two Long Island's not bad at all.  The wings were a bit cold and we ordered honey hot but got barbecue instead (I don't send shit back, I silently sulk and drink more), but overall they were okay, especially for the price.  The fried pickles were better than the ones you get at Lucille's but you have to be a fan of fried pickles to like them either way.  The star of our meal was definitely the spinach and artichoke dip especially since spinach and artichoke dip is some Chili's Applebee's Ultra American bullshit that usually tastes like kitten vomit.  This stuff was good though, a little spicy, creamy, not to clumpy and served in an 80's style bread bowl with tortilla chips and slices of bread that should have been toasted but weren't.  



Our tab was about 50 bucks with a tip which wasn't so bad for how much food and booze we got.  I'm not giving it more stars for a few reasons.



1.  they fucked up our wing order

2.  it took us like a half hour to get our food and they brought ALL the apps out at once which seems retarded when you're just ordering apps.

3. it was fucking dark in there.

4. soooo much mascara.

Servers and restaurant staff like to support their industry, when the atmosphere and food is good.



The food is one of the best aspects of this bar.  The hummus is to die for, and their happy hour specials rock.  I also like the ""stimulus menu"", which offers similar food as the full menu, but cheaper prices and smaller portions.



The outdoor patio area is also nice for socializing.  They have misters, which almost make it bearable in the summer.  There is smoking allowed on the patio, which is helpful if you smoke.",positive

I think everyone should have a pub. It's like a living room away from home. The Armadillo has the requisite multiple TV's,, happy hour specials, pool tables, and an interesting assortment of Runyonesque characters who come and go. It's the closest thing to a dive you'll find in that section of the Camelback Corridor, and I mean that in the best and most enthusiastic sense. I love dives.



The munchies menu (discounted during happy hours and all-day Monday) includes several appetizers, including fried pickles, a very decorative hummus plate, and some of the best wings in the valley (try the Armadillo or Honey-Hot). Drink prices are good, and they have specials like ""PBR power hour"" (one dollar Pabst Blue Ribbon beers for you culturally-impoverished sorts).

They have beer.  They have lots of beer and will keep it coming.  Beware of the tall beers.  They have  way of sneaking up on you.  



Their burgers are great.  They use high quality beef when making them.  I enjoy a burger where I feel like I don't need it covered in cheese to enjoy the flavor.  I don't especially like cheese on a burger but will order it when I think a place is going to be mediocre so that it covers up the flavor.  Their burgers are served on a brioche that is not buttered (yay!).  



I also enjoy their pulled pork sandwich.  



For their sides:



The steak fries are yummy here if you're feeling decadent.



their onion rings are really, really yummy if you're feeling extra decadent.



their salad is really good and comes with a vast assortment of unique dressings.  



Now the downside.  If you got on a Friday or Saturday night then don't expect to be able to carry on a conversation with your friends.  The music is LOUD and inside it is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation unless you're yelling.

We got greeted and seated quickly. I ordered the chicken brie sandwhich and my husband had the meatloaf sandwhich. I am not sure where the comment about small portions came from because they were good sized and we were both stuffed!



The only change to the chicken brie would be to have the pears sliced thinner rather than having thick pears to bite through. Otherwise it was yummy.



I also ordered the ""Arizona Iced Tea"" for the first time since they didn't have fresh mint to make my mojito. I was pleasantly surprised at how light and refreshing it was.

ts17,6/8/2011,revtest2662,4,"I have been here quite a few times for happy hour. This place at first glance is very much a dive pub. Small TVs that need to be badly upgraded take up most of the wall space. The reason for this which you will figure out real quick once inside is that Armadillo Grill is an offsite track betting place as well. 



75% of the TVs (during non-sporting events) will be focused on races across the country and you can go place a bet with a bookie up front as if you were at the track. Kinda cool...but betting on horses is not really my thing. 



Drinks here are your typical bar drinks with a limited selection on happy hour but enough to find something. The Happy hour menu (munchies) has quite a few things on there which are good however the reason to come here are the ""Golden Delicious"" wings. These are what put this place on my radar....those wings are VERY good that it is hard to order anything else anytime I come here. 



As far as non-happy hour....they have your typical pub cold and hot sandwiches like buffalo chicken sandwich and Philly cheesesteak. Nothing is too expensive, but the happy hour is where this place shines.

This time, we sat inside. The walls are lined with TVs showing stats on all the horse races. I think we were the only ones here NOT betting on the races.

ts17,11/1/2011,revtest2668,3,"One of the best values in a happy hour- both food & drink are on the reduced lunch plan. 



Fried pickles, ahi tuna salad and several big cold beers for under $30 including tip. Me likey. The fried pickles not the sliced kind you get at Hooters- these are fried whole, and they are worth the trip.



Vibe here is a little dive-ish, and there was a mix of families in the section furthest from the bar, off-track betters & Phoenix hipsters at the bar, and plenty of non-descript folks here on the Friday night I attended. I'm a big fan of a mixed crowd, so I'm also a big fan of Armadillo.",positive

ts17,12/10/2011,revtest2670,5,"Tasty, tasty food. We mostly go on reverse happy hour and just get apps, but their burgers are really yummy. And the tomato soup! The tomato soup is creamy with chunks of real tomato and their ""cup"" sized bowl is huge. So many good beers here and the Nimbus Old Monkeyshine goes perfectly with the soup. Their fried pickles come in spears but you can ask for slices. The Armadillo gold wings are tasty (and I'm not a huge fan of wings) but stay AWAY from the hummus because it's terrible. 



The staff is friendly and nice, but one time we had horrible service. The water pitcher we asked for since the waitress only came by every 20 minutes had 1/2 water, 1/2 sprite. They got rid of her really quickly, so now everyone is nice.

First of all, the appetizers are just crazy cheap during happy hour, and it way generous portions at that. $3.75 for a plate of decent calamari? Sweet. The same price for a generous portion of hummus and pita? Score! Wash it down with the nice tap selection...they have some four peaks brews, and of course a modest liquor selection that covers he basics.



You can bet on horse races if you have any idea what you're doing. Or you can grab a table and yell at the TV as loud as you want. People here are nice enough to be chill about it. The staff is both kind and prompt. I like.",positive

Definitely the right mix of dive bar and neighborhood hangout.",positive
ts17,5/2/2012,revtest2678,5,Love this place! I love their eclectic menu and I've been pleased with everything I've tried. Number ONE place for calamari! I have yet to go there without ordering it.,positive
ts17,5/8/2012,revtest2679,4,"Bottom line: Great food. Decor could use some help, and the TV's were a bit small to be a sports bar. Food was affordable, and portions were large.



Drinks were as expected, nothing good or bad about it. I had Kiltlifter, my friends had sodas and iced teas.



We ordered some buffalo and honey bbq wings, as well as some calamari. First, the wings were huge, which was good because we only got about 8 for the 1lb order. But they were very well done, and the flavor was not added on post cooking, as most average establishments do. No, the flavor was baked in. 



The calamari was not rubbery, but had a good snap, which means it was well cooked and of good quality. The breading wasn't overboard, and had a nice crunch to it. Very well done.



For the entrees, we had the Beef Stroganoff, the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, and I ordered the Mac and Cheese with the Buffalo chicken upgrade.



First, my Mac and Cheese. It definitely wasn't box mac. It had a few cheeses that were  blended and mixed in with penne, and the dollar upgrade of buffalo chicken was a heapful of chicken on top. It came together very well, and tasted great. Well worth it, and the extra for Buffalo chicken. Portion size was also good.



The Beef Stroganoff was well done according to my friend, and it looked huge. Comfort foods should always be generous portions and have a nice home cooked feel to it in order to be successful. They were.



And the Buffalo Chicken sandwich? My friend said it was the biggest one he'd ever gotten. It looked it. And he enjoyed it. So there's that. It didn't look too extravagant, but then it shouldn't be. It just looked big and tasty.



So why four stars? First, the decor was fairly outdated. It looked kind of like a neighborhood bar, but facing Camelback, and being so close to the Biltmore, I really thought they could use an upgrade. The TV's were at best 30's and the audio was low. A sports bar usually has at least a few 50's and pump out the sound for the major games. 



But, all this could be why their prices are affordable (just go to Biltmore instead, and overpay for the ambiance), and their food is certainly good enough to keep people coming back. In fact, writing this review, I believe I shall go there again tonight.",positive
ts17,5/22/2012,revtest2680,5,"For what it is, a neighborhood sports bar and grill, the AG exceeds on all counts.  Off track betting, usually friendly service, amazing drink deals, and surprisingly great food - their Armadillo Gold wings may very well be the best in town.  



What you won't get here is hipster pretension - but if you're looking for an unassuming place to grab a drink and budget friendly nosh and maybe bet on a horse race - this, ladies and germs, should be your stopping place.",positive

Lots of seating, pool tables, TVs, and lots of activity but all of it friendly and open. Then there's the food-oh, my! The burgers are fabulous-fresh ground beef, fresh buns, ripe tomatoes and lettuce, and great fries. I also LOVE the tomato soup...WOW! You have to try the tomato soup!  They have a decent beer and wine selection, and even their coffee is good!

Un-real.  Some of the best ""bar food"" I've ever had.  Good happy hour (half priced apps and drink specials) makes me happy.  place is always busy during the afternoons for off track betting which is fun while you're having a guiness and stuffing your face!

After reading all the reviews, damn, I wish i would have tried some food. We came here while plowing thru bars one night in Phoenix. The prices were very reasonable and got smashed off Kiltlifter and shots of Jameson (this seems to be a very disturbing trend). Our waitresses were the bomb. Had a great time. Cool little shindig of an area if you're in the area.



Plus, Jerome is my hero.",positive
ts17,7/30/2012,revtest2687,5,Well it's a dive bar! This is by far one of my favorite places to chill out! I lived in Phoenix for 9 years and now I am in San Diego.

Try the Armadillo Gold sauce on the wings.  Other food items seem to be above average, particularly for a local bar.  They rave about the stroganoff and macaroni, but I haven't had it yet. Friendly service, juke box and local regulars atmosphere. I'm becoming a loyal fan.",positive
ts17,8/15/2012,revtest2689,3,"This place is right down the street from the office, and I've gone here with co-workers for lunch many times over the past few months.  The place is okay, and seems to have some serious track betting going on here. Several TV's with horse racing on, machines and some betting tickets and such. I'm not much of a better myself, so I'm not even really sure how it works at this place.



Anyways, I'm kind of torn between two and three stars for this place.  For starters, the inside kind of feels dated, and its always dark when we're there. Also, we usually sit in the back when we are here, since our party size is usually between 6 and 9 people at any given time.  Someone always calls ahead from the office to let them know we're coming in, so they already have the table set up in the back for us when we arrive.



My problem is two fold with Armadillos. First, is that it the service always seems slow, and secondly, they don't seem to have a great lunch menu. It seems to be mostly dinner type dishes, that can be quite big and heavy for the middle of the day.  They have an insert to their menu with ""daily specials"" but nothing that really caters to the lunch crowd.  I mean, sometimes I want a light lunch, not a huge heavy lunch that makes me tired for the rest of the day.



Also, most of the time here it seems to take forever to get our bill, and our food. I know their busy cooking it, but being that they open at 11 AM, and when we arrive we're usually the first people to be in there (aside from a few stragglers at the bar) I wish it wouldn't take so long to get our food.  Plus, we only have an hour for lunch!  One time, it took so long to get our bill, we started getting ansy and tried to hurry out of the place. We have to be back at the office by 12:30, and we didn't get our bills until 12:30!  By the time we all got our change and cards back and left, it was after 12:45, and we didn't get back to the office until 12:50.  We were 20 minutes late back from lunch!



I only go here now because once in a while the ladies from work take me, and its not half bad food. I just wish they had a better lunch time menu and that the service would pick up a bit so we don't spend so much time waiting and paying for our bills.",negative

Happy hour food specials are really hard to beat . . . wings in Armadillo Gold style, fried pickles, fried mozzarella, calamari . . . .evidently, everything is from scratch too.  Beef Stroganoff, Chicken Parmigiana, and the fish in parchment are all awesome. Bartenders are friendly, casual, and do a good job. Only time I sat at the table, the waitress was hilarious and fun. I don't drink, so not sure how they poor drinks but probably not too shabby because most of the their clientele seem to be long-term regulars. Update. Everything is still great here.

ts17,2/8/2013,revtest2701,4,"Armadillo Grill has always been a great go-to for good bar food. Besides general bar-fare, they offer some of the best weekly dish specials a bar can conjure up. They are not simply a OTB or pool hall... they are much much more.



~Fud/Drink~

As stated, they have superb dish choices each week. They do seafood/fish surprisingly well. The most memorable dish from here was actually a Basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes. That, my friends, is NOT traditional bar-fare. The chef they have locked up (love that comment Joe S.) does a stellar job. Please don't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up. But this is a multidimensional bar, which makes it so unique. They also have stellar drink specials throughout the week and into the weekend. The barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in! They offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one. 



~Atmosphere/Service~

Once again, service is superb every time I go. I am by no means a regular, but they treat you like one. I feel at home here when I come in to have a bite or shoot some pool. There is no real dive atmosphere, its truly an interesting mix. The inside is by no means ""nice"", its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room. Along with the bar area with the regulars and the OTB on the screens with rooting betters, it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one. You do not need to worry about loud noise though, the patio outside is helpful and can alleviate any issues with inside noise. I never have noticed much of a noise factor though, its a fine spot to both watch a game and dine at. Its impressive how you can go about it at the 'Dillo.



~Extras/Rating~

Call ahead for specials that day/week, the website they have does not get updated at all unfortunately. Look online, there are numerous coupons available from different spots... I use Entertainment coupons here and they work like a charm! They aren't the finest bar in town, that's understood. But its drink specials, above-par food, central location and outstanding staff each earn a star, giving them 4 overall stars. Much love for the 'Dillo, can't wait to go back and check in!",positive
ts17,2/15/2013,revtest2702,3,"This place is half off-track gambling and half-sports bar as evidenced by what is on the TV's as well as the patrons. So for me, on the one hand having to be around the knuckle heads who want to waste vast amounts of time and money on which horse can run fastest is a negative. The dark and dingy interior doesn't help either.  



But on the other hand, the food is certainly a cut above the typical greasy, soggy bar food one usually encounters at most sports bars for a decent price. If you're there to watch a whole football game like I would on a few occasions you could end up spending in the mid to high 20's when it's done, but if you're just there to get a meal and maybe a beer, then obviously you won't end up spending as much like around $15. The bartenders are overall ok. No real issue there.



Overall it's more of an interesting experience than a pleasant experience, which is why I will pop in from time to time, but only from time to time just to mix it up.



Oh yeah, and to their credit (at least in my book) they play metal later in the night when all the games are over and there's no more retarded horse racing on.",negative

A new server was being trained and she was doing great! I had their Tomato Basil soup. It says on the menu this is there specialty and I can see why. It sure was delish. My friend had the Parchment Paper Salmon which she said was great. I tried it. I am not a salmon lover but it had this mustard type sauce on it that I could probably drink and live on! -teehee! I would go back to try some of their other yummy looking food delights. The atmosphere is an upgrade sports bar type of decor so it was a little noisy. The only advice I have is that their bathroom was a tad nasty. Maybe clean it better AG? However,  I could have hit it at a bad time.",positive
ts17,3/21/2013,revtest2704,4,"First time to Armadillo Grill and I was pleasantly surprised. Based on other people's reviews, I was expecting a dingy, dark dive bar. This is just not the case! I think many people simply have never been to a real dive before. The area surrounding the bar was dimly lit, but that's a good thing! It looked pretty awesome in there actually, and the pool tables were in a separate area in the back. We sat in the other separate area with booths which was brighter and gave it a quieter, more restaurant feel (even the bar area was NOT that loud).



I have to agree with everyone's love of the fried pickles. Went with the original kind. I think they dip them in panko after the batter, super crunchy and delicious. I forced my roommate to try one bite with ranch dressing (he HATES pickles), but he actually couldn't seem to stop taking more bites. Pretty funny! I ordered the salmon in parchment special for $9.99. While it was good, it was not great. It tasted like the salmon I buy (and cook myself) from Costco. A little chewy on the teeth, but hey, it's 9.99! It came with green beans, broccoli and carrots which were really well prepared with garlic. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed cooked veggies so much. There was wild rice pilaf as well. Tasted like the kind I used to buy in small boxes at the store. That's not a complaint, it's good. My roommate ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which he liked very much.



I think we were supposed to get the pickles at half price since we ordered at 6:45, but were charged full price. It didn't matter this time since we were using a Groupon and were a little short using the whole thing anyway, just something to note. Service was a little slow at times, but not enough to make us upset, we weren't in a hurry. Besides, everyone there was VERY friendly, even the servers that we only saw in passing smiled and said hello. That's pretty rare, especially in Phoenix (I'm a native, I can say it)!

There are a lot of locals who frequent here, I would guess more on Monday. That's very much a guess because its the only day I went! You know what happens when you assume though...



Anyhow! It's very low key with great prices on drinks! Bar tenders are happy to give up suggestions when you're ready for something new. This is nice when you're as indecisive as myself.



They have loads of games besides pool. Darts, touch screen, etc. You will NOT be bored! (:  The patio is a tad small and on a main road, but that's ok I was always too busy inside on the games to notice.

For dinner I had the Grilled Cheese with soup; I could eat this every day it was so good. It was made with two types of cheese on sour dough bread, and they have a different soup every week. 

I give the food a 10, but the service was poor. I'm a server, so I know what the restaurant business is like. My boyfriend never got offered another beer, and I didn't get a refill on my soda until I was finished. I rarely saw my server, but she mentioned they had a groupon ending that day so that would explain her lack of attention. Although, the place didn't seem busy to me. 

Overall, I will be a returning customer. I have already recommended this place multiply times.",positive

Every time I eat here I'm pleasantly surprised that it's not run-of-the-mill bar fare. Whoever they've got in the kitchen is putting thought into the product and it shows. 



The atmosphere is rad. It's one part bar, one part restaurant from a decade or two ago, and part OTB. To sum it up - unique. And that's what I like. The service has never been an issue and I will most definitely return!",positive
ts17,2/2/2014,revtest2725,4,"Good good ol' Armadillo Grill. It's been years since I used to frequent this place during my car biz days, back then I used to come here for their ""Armadillo Gold"" wings and CHEAP happy hour drink specials. This review will focus on my most recent experience here. 



I came here because I was looking for a reasonably priced healthy meal at 1 am, a virtually impossible combination to find at this time. And I got exactly that, a hearty blackened chicken salad with fresh greens topped with a generous amount of moist and savory chicken. It was very good, and for about $10 it's the only place I can think of that I can get a quality salad this late at night let alone for that price.



In addition to the food which is surprisingly good for a bar, they have very attentive and friendly service. I always leave 'dillo feeling well fed and like I got my money's worth. This establishment has made it's self synonymous with quality food and value in my book and earns a 4.5 from me.",positive
ts17,2/15/2014,revtest2726,4,"Saturday lunch at Armadillo.

We've seen this place for years but never stopped before. We were in the neighborhood this time and decided to give it a try.

I do not know what is that I was expecting, but this was not it.

It was good, though.

It is kind of tiny, it is more of a bar...

And, oh my, they had something like incense burning or some odd smell... not for me : (

We sat by a corner and Mike was our server.

He was outstanding. He asked if we had been there before and gave us some history and recommendations. He was very friendly and approachable.



Well, we like it when a place has a signature dish, and for Armadillo Grill it seems to be fried pickles. Not my proudest moment, truth be told, but they were actually good : P

We had half regular, half Cajun. I liked them both but I liked the ranch best.



We ended up ordering the Thai Chicken skewers and the Louisiana meatball sandwich.

I just tasted them both as I was not very hungry, I thought they were a good and hubby liked them very much. He said the chicken skewers were very tasty even without the sauce.



I only had water, hubby had diet coke. Next time I will have a beer : )",positive

He had the fish tacos and seemed to enjoy them. I have the palette of a five year-old so I ordered a chicken quesadilla with refried beans added. It was delicious - way too much for one meal. The server was attentive but not overbearing. I was a little concerned about parking because that's an issue for a lot of restaurants on that strip of Camelback but since we met there at 1pm on a Friday, we had no problem with that.",positive

The Mozzarella appetizer is fantastic too - 1/2 during happy hour. They freshly make these from scratch each time. The service is fantastic too. Normally I sit at the bar and order food and the bartenders have always been great.

I love their chicken wings and they have some other decent finger foods. I really only go for the apps, I feel that's where sports bars tend to shine the most. The only complaint is the beer taste off. It's probably improper tap line cleaning or possibly the co2 is off. It's one of my very few pet peeves and The Dillo isn't the only place guilty of it. If you're going to have the state flagship beer on tap then it needs to taste right. I'd give it 3.5 for sports bars. Decent prices and decent music being pumped out. Half Moon has some better deals on happy hour but good lord I can't stand the ambiance. Dillo is a decent priced neighborhood bar.",negative

The servers are super friendly and know their shi....stuff :) Virginia and Amy are awesome. 



Tomato soup - hands down the BEST I have ever had. Slightly sweet and very creamy. WOW. Serious mouthgasm. 



Smothered chicken - excellent gravy. I have had this one more times than I can count. Corn can be a little dry but you can always substitute a different side. 



Fried pickles - these are spears, not slices, but the breading has great flavor and is very crisp. 



Quesadillas and burgers are good, fairly standard but still tasty. 



All of their pastas are excellent. Can't go wrong here. 





Was not a fan of the meatloaf sandwich but the actual meatloaf dinner is well done. This sandwich is the only thing I ever ordered here that left me at all disappointed and I've probably stuffed my face with 3/4 of the stuff on the menu by now. 



Overall, their food has a home cooked, fresh flavor. Nothing tastes likes a tv dinner and for a sports bar, it goes above and beyond what I would expect for food.

The best part was the food, I got a grilled cheese with tomato soup. Ate it all so fast, the soup was especially amazing. Also came during happy hour, so I tried some martinis! My favorite was the Jolly Rancher. Really does taste like a Jolly Rancher. A very cute, girly, pink drink! Also got a Bloody Mary type martini and sent it back because I really did not like it. I think I just prefer to keep my martinis fruity, just my personal taste. Also got a cosmo and it was really strong. Not too bad though, I liked it.

My boyfriend loves a good divey bar that is not so trendy and yuppie, as he puts it. This to me was just nice and surprising. The bar staff was super friendly. The beer on tap was nice and cold. Peach Ale from 4Peaks is always a win-win for me! 4Peaks Kiltlifter on tap for him. Off track betting on the tele. Pool tables around the place. For 345pm in the afternoon, it was already packed! We didn't want to mess our appetites up, so we only opted for the fried pickles and went half regular and half cajun spicy. YUMMY!

ts17,8/18/2014,revtest2741,3,"I recently went here  for dinner upon  my arrival in Phoenix from San Diego. I will first say that the food was absolutely delicious and would bring me back, we had the fried pickles as an appetizer, they were very good , I recommend getting half cajun style and half original. For dinner I had the buffalo chicken burger, if you like buffalo chicken get this it was delicious to the end with its brioche bun. My friend got the fish tacos which was a huge serving but she thoroughly enjoyed. My conclusion on their food was big portions (I would share next time unless you want leftovers), delicious, and there was a good variety on the menu. As far as the service is concerned (I will first say that I myself am a server so I have taken into account quite a few things),our server took forever to come to get our order and when she finally did she just got the drink order then proceed to run around her section without our drinks for at least five minutes ( we all got beer so should have been fairly quick), then after she dropped those off even though we had our menus stacked to indicate readiness she left and did not return for about 10 minutes. Might I add that it was happy hour when we got there but since she did not take our full order for about 15 minutes we did not get to take advantage of it because the computers switch over automatically. Not to mention she had to keep running back and forth to ask questions, I get it there is a lot to memorize but their menu is fairly small and if you work happy hour you definitely need to know your drink menu. All in all I would return but don't go starving because it may be a while. Delicious food, average service.",negative

Amy was our waitress and she was phenomenal, she knew when to come around and ask us if we needed help or knew when to leave us to our football games. The best part is that they were very accommodating with the Tv's. I hate hate hate going to BWW's and having to fend for myself in a ring of other football fans. This place was small and had more than enough TV's to fit any fan, they best part is that none of them were connected to another Tv meaning if we changed one TV it wouldn't change someone else's game.



I have to say the the selection of food is okay, I wish they had more variety of food. It's the typical wings, burgers, and appetizers....I guess that's all you need for a sports bar...lol but if I could want to change something it would be to add more variety: more salad choices, maybe fruit trays?, or more desserts!!!

There are many nice-sized screens to watch whichever games are on... however, when I was there to watch the Sunday morning NFL games, they were having a very difficult time coordinating the broadcasts. Without warning, my game was switched out with under two minutes to go in the fourth quarter, which was mortifying. At one point, multiple screens were broadcasting a QVC-style infomercial for collectable coins as multiple confused patrons stared on with bafflement.



The reason why this is a four as opposed to a three is a combination of the redeeming products and service quality, and also because the manager was responsive and clearly making a real effort to fix everything. If/when they figure out their technology, this place is a five.",positive

You get to choose between egg drop soup or hot and sour and comes with an egg roll and fried rice. I ordered a tea to drink. The lady came out with a dish of those won ton crispies. Please see pic. And seconds later the hot and sour soup. Not even a three spoonfuls of soup and the Hunan beef came out!

Also, what was endearing is that while I was eating, the staff/family had a lunch while I was eating. They were eating lo mein and either chicken or duck. It looked like a nice family, chatting and smiling and sharing a meal. I respect that.",positive

They even have mini juke boxes at each table and you can pick a song for a quarter I think.



Tip: If you are looking for a late eat besides the 24-hour Mexican joint, this may work.  Open until 10 Sun-Thu, and until 11:30 Fri-Sat.  Or, the one on 16th St in Phoenix is open 24 hrs.",negative

MMMM all of my favorite foods on a plate. The bf had the same, but with a chocolate milkshake! I hate boys and their fast metabolisms.

To start...the food here is pretty much all good. The only thing I would suggest avoiding is the nachos. They load them up but so much the chips turn soggy real quick. However they have odd things like deep fried pickles which are delicious and their breakfast foods are super delicious.



The staff is wonderful and we are never left for wanting to say the least. Some of them actually recognize us by face which is nice. 



The restaurant itself is really nice, some of the seats are a bit beat up but otherwise it's always really clean and they have mini juke boxes at each table and you get 2 songs for a quarter so bring your change! Unless you hate 50s music that is. It's also all 50 decor inside so if you're looking for a nostalgic place, this is the place to go.



As for the shakes, everyone is right in saying they are awesome and they're HUGE. I can almost never finish them. 



Over all, I'd highly suggest this place and also you can ask for the discount cards so if you get 7 meals, you get 1 free. It's not very pricey either which is a plus.",positive

I wasn't planning on salsa for my Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs but sure, what the hell.  Well, the salsa was delicious with the perfect amount of kick - I ended up dousing my buttery hashbrowns in it and going to town.  Eggs and chicken fried steak were both tasty and the toast was thick cut and good to sop up the extra gravy.  My husband had an omlette which he seemed to enjoy, though the portion looked just a tad small.  Truly a yummy 3-star meal, though the great service just bumped things up even more.  They were just SO nice and so insistent that we come back, I'm wondering if the location (in the Arizona Mills parking lot) is making the business struggle a bit.

I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.

Here's a useful bit of information for my fellow Chicagoans: 5 & Diner serves Vienna pure beef hot dogs. My personal lunch favorite, my main reason for giving them five stars, is their veggie burger, which I order with green chile, no cheese, and a side of french fries. Be sure to ask for the Cholula hot sauce. This is a great casual dining spot with a classic diner motif and golden oldies playing regularly to accompany your meal.

ts22,10/27/2012,revtest2803,4,"Woohoo! This particular Five and Diner is as good as it gets for a Five and diner!!! 



The owner, Val, is wonderful. Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff. 



Much of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years. Sometimes she has an awesome magician there.. and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner. 



So.. I love the people who work there, and I love the fun, festive atmosphere most of the time (depending on my mood). I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud. Again, this is probably due to whether I'm tired or my daughter is bugging me too much or I happen to have a headache, etc. I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so. She REALLY aims to please. 



The food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order. It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere. 



The fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them). The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value. My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves.  



I order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best. Tip: get the biscuits and skip the toast or tortilla, or hash browns, etc.. My daughter loves their macaroni and cheese and all their other kid items. I believe kid menu items are 99 cents when an adult purchases an entree on M-F. If not M-F, I know for sure kids are 99 cents on Fridays.",positive

Cashier and counter help, are dim and of the opinion, they really should be doing something more than waiting on middle age housewives calling in pizza orders. I hope something better comes along as well, but in the meantime your attitude is definitely cutting into your tip jar.

It was a random hour - 3pm this afternoon, and we weren't sure what to eat. So we stopped in and checked out the menu.  Definitely reasonably priced, so we stuck around. My dining partner ordered the creamy pasta with mushrooms, asparagus, and chicken. I had the Italiano sandwich. Salami and italian meats with oil, vinegar, provolone, lettuce, tomato, and pepperonccini. I also had an arnold palmer, which the waitress accidentally made with passion fruit iced tea rather than regular - and it was amazing. My sandwich came with the fried zucchini chips and at that point I was pretty certain I had died and gone to zucchini heaven. Worth the trip alone. I ate all of them.



Friend and I traded bites, her pasta was very tasty. The starter bread and oil they brought out was good. My other half of sandwich came home with me.

The food was quick and the service was very pleasant. The salad was a full serving and sharing was not a problem. The black olives were a hit for Tara, my daughter and a great hit for my wife since she loves Balsamic Vinaigrette. The combination of greens, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese and croutons makes for a refreshing salad.



The BBQ Style Chicken pizza is also big enough to share as well. Made with BBQ Sauce, Roasted Chicken, Roasted Red Onions, and Cilantro. This really hits the spot. I prefer a sweet tangy BBQ sauces over the spicy type and this one fits into my preference.

As usual our server was prompt and attentive, unfortunately when the food came I can't say the same.  Two out of the Four of our party had ordered calzones, we got our food and started eating.  The other calzone had the wrong ingredients and had to be remade, but by the time the remake made it out to us it was cold.  Mine was missing an ingredient and also contained uncooked mushrooms, which if you eat mushrooms you understand the world of difference in texture and flavor from cooked to uncooked.  In the end our server and the manager apologized multiple times for the food and explained they have a new chef.  She also comped one of the calzones and comped a dessert too which will make me come back.

ts25,10/2/2010,revtest2835,4,This was a very nice mellow restraunt that was perfect for girl talk and resting while helping a friend apartment search.  I liked the food and the prices.  I ordered a salad and pizza special that was very good.  I enjoyed the misto salad and the pizza was very fresh and delicious too.  My friend got a calazone that was steaming hot and looked delicious.  I will definately go back.,positive
ts25,10/19/2010,revtest2836,3,"I am a big fan of Babbo...maybe just not this location as much as others.  I am giving this location 3 stars, but mind you the location on 16th St. is deserving of 4.  Guess it is all about the location in this case.



We arrived shortly after 7 pm on a Monday night.  The place was packed!  I really wanted to sit on the patio and eat, but apparently you can't drink alcoholic beverages outside, so inside it was.



It seemed as if they had about 4 new people starting.  Our server had a shadow and he followed every action she did in succession with her moves.  Slightly odd.



The bread was delivered to our table promptly.  What a nice treat!  I like that they sliced it up for us and brought us extras free of charge to munch on.  It was fresh, warm, and had the perfect amount of baked red onions on it to add a hint of sweetness.  Fear not, they also provide you with a plethora of oil and vinegar for dipping, to which I added mounds of pepper, parm cheese, and crushed red pepper to spice it up.



We decided to order a side mista salad to split with each other.  It was ehhhh, but not as fresh as I have experienced before.  I do really enjoy the mista salad and the variety of items that are in it.  It is not just your traditional crappy house salad that you get from many other competitor restaurants.



The food took a while to arrive, so more bread was delivered in the mean time.  I ordered the creamy garlic chicken and my fiance the southwestern chicken pasta.  For both, the sauce could have been a little thicker, but in either case it made for great dipping of the bread.  The sun dried tomatoes in my pasta were horribly sour and added a slightly funky taste to the whole meal.  I settled with picking them out and the rest was okay from that point forward.  I added in lots of extra parm cheese to give the sauce more thickness and ultimately provide more flavor.  



I decided that I preferred the meal that my fiance ordered better than mine (I HATE when that happens!).  I did notice a lack of overall ingredients such as the bell peppers and green onions, but in either case his was delicious.  He mentioned that the peppers were a little undercooked and may have tasted better if they were sauteed. 



Overall, not a bad experience, but I definitely prefer the alternate locations as of this point.  I will definitely go back and give it a second chance and hopefully bump up my initial rating.",negative
ts25,4/3/2011,revtest2837,4,"We love Babbo's.  We've been going since they've opened.  We usually get a salad, bread, and an entree to share.  We get out under $20 most times (depending on the entree).  This place is cheaper and way better than Olive Garden.  Service has always been excellent.  Out of the 100 times we've been there only had a problem once and they handled it very professionally-and it was no big deal.  If you want average Italian fare at a good price with nice people this is your place.  They do take out too which is nice when you are too tired to eat in.  They also have a nice patio to dine on when weather permits.",positive

This was close to where we were staying and looked nice with good reviews.  Wow, I really enjoyed this place!  The service was friendly, and quite a good menu.  I decided on a pizza with meatballs on it and my friend got the pasta puglia and we shared.  The pasta puglia was AMAZING!!!  So fresh and tasty; but we got it on spagettini instead of the fusilli.  I really enjoyed the pizza too!  Good crust, not too think and the meatballs were not dried out from the oven; the garlic was a great touch!  The bread you get to start is also quite good!



I would definately return!",positive

One of my favorites is the Pasta Primavera because of all the tasty veggies, but I recently had the Bolognese and it was fantastic as well. Great customer service here as well.

I ordered Pasta Valducci and my husband ordered Caprese pizza, which was just amazing... i kept taking bites from his plate... i just loved my pasta which was such a fresh change for my tastebuds.

I have been coming here for years and would be lying if I didn't tell you that I am addicted to the Napa Valley salad....I know I dont eat salad, but when I do it is this one.  The service is always great here and the atmosphere is really nice considering it is in a Safeway shopping center.  The hot bread they bring out is always gone in seconds since my kids even inhale the bread with oil and vinegar.  I also think that their fettuccine alfredo is one of the best I have ever had.  I dont get it much since I am pretty sure my arteries will get clogged if I do but on a special occasion I will take one for the team.

I had the Artichoke, Shrimp & Crab Dip which was good, but I wish it had more chucks of crab. I obviously tried their spaghetti with meatballs which I thought was good, but not  the best I've had. The sauce was a bit to watery for me and the meatballs just didn't have that ""wow"" factor, but it was good (just not the best). I had also ordered a customize Calzone and that was without a doubt fabulous! The size and flavor were definitely in the ""wow"" factor.

My personal favorite meal would be the bread followed by the Roasted Brussels Sprout Beet Salad and The Amalfi Thin & Crusty pizza served with a nice bottle of red wine. I have had some of their pasta dishes as well and they were all very good.

The bread! Oh MY stars! the free bread is amazing! it's super soft and flavorful and every time I go to an Italian restaurant I sorely miss Babbo's bread!

And the gargonzola salad is to die for. Whenever I go, I eat a TON of bread and order this salad. The salads are always super fresh and this particular salad is amazing!

Just for these two things, I give it 5 stars.

Unfortunately, I've had other items on the menu that I don't care for so I stick to this specific order:)

ts25,3/13/2013,revtest2868,5,"******This review was for my visit on Valentine's Day 2013*******



I LOVE this place! I think I visit at least once a month. It's a family favorite for sure.



Well, my anniversary actually falls on Valentine's Day so when it came to picking a place to have a romantic dinner, we actually wanted to come to Babbo's. So we both dressed up and without even a reservation, took a chance and drove to the restaurant. Surprisingly enough, it was only a 10 minute wait. We sat down and waited a very comfy couch and before I knew it, our name was called. They sat us by the wall where it was very intimate and romantic.



We were immediately served free bread and water. The bread is just amazing. It's a little addicting so be careful not to stuff yourself before dinner. We decided on an appetizer of toasted ravioli. First time I tried it and I was so happy we ordered it!! I normally order just their spaghetti and meatball but I was feeling adventurous so my server recommended the pasta martini. I almost ordered it just for the name!! The bf ordered a chicken and bbq calzone and he was a happy camper for sure!



While waiting for our food, a manager walked up to our table and explained that the pasta line was backed up and that he sincerely apologized for the wait and that he would give us an employee discount. I didn't even realize that 20 minutes went by. Our glasses were constantly refilled and the bread kept coming fresh from the oven. It was a pleasent surprise indeed.



What topped it off was the main course itself. The pasta martini was just AMAZING!!! Wasn't too saucy or too light. It was just right! We skipped dessert that evening because we were SO full from bread! They were gracious enough to pack the other half of our dinner that wasn't consummed as well as some extra bread to take home with us! What a team! The service was just wonderful! 



Thank you Babbo's for making my night!!",positive
ts25,3/27/2013,revtest2869,5,We eat here at least once a week and order things for the entire office as well. Prices are very fair and the food is amazing. I've tried just about everything on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed. Defiantly our local favorite!,positive

There was a pizza and a lot of their bread in the mix as well. No one had a compliant we were all very happy with our meal and even the food snob said he would come back and get the same thing again.

From bringing the main dish way before we even finished our salad to not splitting the bill, Ryan was in need of some additional training.  Again, the food is consistently good.

We've been able to find delicious salads at Babbo's, and come back here as often as we can. We would eat here more often, but we struggle to close our business before 9:00pm, so we can't eat out on weekday nights. We bring guests and friends here, and recommend, for example, the chopped gorgonzola salad (sub flank steak for chicken for $1-2 extra).

We got there around 5:15 in the evening & were seated right away, service was lacking but the food made up for it. My husband & I both ordered the $5.99 spaghetti & meatballs special. It was sooooo good. I'm not usually very impressed by such a simple dish but man, those meatballs are amazing. They also had some really good happy hour deals until 6pm that I want to try & come back for.",positive
ts25,3/17/2014,revtest2892,3,"Honestly, I can't quite make up my mind about this place. The food is consistently good -- especially enjoy the salads -- but the service dips back and forth between being excellent and horrible. One time, we were on the patio for more than 15 minutes (yes, we timed it) without being approached, and there WERE a couple of waiters working the area, so we simply stood being ignored for a certain amount of time and left. Recently, when my husband and I were sitting at the bar, a staff member (think it was management) was on her cell phone having what was obviously a personal conversation. Then there have been times when the service was absolutely great, and our servers were extremely personable and efficient without being sycophantic. As former service industry employees, my husband and I place a high premium on good service. That being said, if you want excellent food and don't much care whether you get good or bad service, give this place a try. Hope this was helpful!",negative

ts25,3/26/2014,revtest2894,4,"I had a chance to eat at Babbo with a couple of old friends from high school last night and it was very enjoyable!  We met up at 5:30; the place was packed but my savvy friends were waiting at the bar.with wine glasses in hand and names on the list .  We were seated promptly and commenced to catching up. While looking st the menu.



Contrary to what previous helpers have said, service was attentive and pacing was good.  Friend 1 had penne with vodka sauce, friend 2 had pasta with a lovely cream sauce, and I had spaghetti and meatballs   All dishes were pronounced tasty and portions were large enough to take home leftovers .



I rarely eat pasta but I can happily recommend Babbo for pricing,  service, and palate-pleasing.  Everything was yummy and our party spent less than 25 dollars each including wine and tip.



Babbo is a place worth trying!",positive
ts25,4/5/2014,revtest2895,4,"Great place for the prices. Love their ""Bowl of Bolognese"".  When you are seated they bring out olive oil with balsamic vinegar on a plate with some small slices of bread that appears to be made of the same dough they use for the pizza crust. We split a Mista salad which is perfect for the 2 of us. The place is both attractive and plain at the same time. Nice decorating accents make the place look inviting right when you get in the door. Other parts of the dining room are rather plain however with plain tables and chairs. The place always looks clean however. I'd definitely return and recommend to others.",positive

I'm married to an Italian, so I'm lucky enough to get traditional (delicious) Italian food.  I wanted to try this place because it's close to home and I had heard some great things about it.



It's not a very large, and the service is a little spotty. The second time we came the bar tender was seating people because there didn't appear to be a hostess.  So it took about 5-6 minutes to get a table when the entire restaurant was open. 



The bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is pretty dang good. My husband ate 3 plates full the last time we were there... I may have helped him with the 3 plates full lol.



The first time I tried the Spicy Alfredo with Italian Sausage.  The sausage is REALLY GOOD, definitely has some heat to it! The sauce good, it could have used a little more mushrooms in my opinion. 



The second time I tried the Creamy Mushroom and Asparagus Pasta.  The asparagus seemed a little undercooked, and the sauce was okay, a little bland. 



Everyone is very friendly and the décor is nice. I'd like to go back and try a salad; I've seen them walk by our table a couple times and they look really good.",negative
ts25,4/27/2014,revtest2899,3,"Food was fairly good and priced fair considering the portion size.  Except for the drinks though.  Thought it was ridiculous that ice tea cost $3+.   



Service could be better.  We waited a little more than 10 minutes before the waitress came by to take our drink orders.  Typically,  this would annoy the heck out of me and I would have complained but the weather was too nice outside that I didn't mind just chilling out.  



Food came out fast and hot.  I ordered the chicken Chipotle pasta and my sister ordered the pasta dish with Gorgonzola creme sauce.  



I would come back and try this place again.  I'll probably end up sitting inside versus the patio.  Maybe the service will be better.",negative

We waited 50 minutes just for beer and salads.   The lunch took over two hours.   Today I went again with my husband and it took us 35 minutes for a salad and water/tea.   They always use the same excuse.   ""She's backed up on the salads.""   Another excuse we have heard ""we had a big party today.""    The main manager knows we are regulars but never says ""hi.""

The food itself is absolutely delicious and they have a pasta special, $5.99 for Spaghetti and Meatballs on Monday and Tuesday nights. It's a generous portion, very filling and very gourmet tasting.



The atmosphere is top notch and even when they're very busy it never takes too horribly long to get seated.

I was craving meatballs in sauce and didn't have time to make it. (I'm Italian and always make my Italian food from scratch.) So we ordered spaghetti and meatballs to go on our way home. In my mind there are 2 dishes you should rate an Italian restaurant on -- meatballs and sauce. If those 2 are good, they can probably handle everything else. And Babbo knows both!



Since then we've ordered 'to go' and had eat in. Their salads are delicious, especially the roasted brussel sprout, beet salad. I'm addicted to it. I also love their free focaccia, although it could use more toasting. There is also a wide array of pastas and a happy hour that I'm looking forward to trying.

I ordered the pasta rustico. It was scrumptious and I got a bit of a food coma afterward - that's what happens when you carb load, but it was well worth it!



The pasta dishes are probably good for 2 meals, so the $11 price tag is really not too steep for a casual lunch out. I brought my leftovers home. The bread and olive oil they serve with it is also delicious!",positive

I wanted to try the Milaneza (breaded beef steak) torta but it wasn't available so I got the chorizo con huevo torta.  We also tried carne asada fries and al pastor torta.



Chorizo con Huevo Torta and Al Pastor Torta::

Comes with avocado, tomatoes and lettuce. Not enough meat and the bread was alright.  The chorizo torta had tiny pieces of chorizo and a fried egg. Quite spicy. The Al Pastor was tasty. 3.5/5



Carne Asada Fries:

The fries themselves were great. Crunchy and hot. Topped with sour cream, CHEEZ WIZ, carne asada and cotija cheese. I was going back and forth between liking it and not liking it. I was against the use of Cheez Wiz on this one because that's just not how you do carne asada fries. But does it taste good? Absolutely! 4/5



Horchata:

I haven't had horchata I didn't like. Their version is good but a bit sweeter and reminded me of cake icing for some reason. 3.5/5

Also had the Al Pastor Torta. Very good! Lots of flavor in the al pastor, and it was tender considering it's not rotisserie style. Portion was also large considering the cheap entry price!

The atmosphere is top notch.  Every place setting was perfectly laid out, and the tables were close enough to be intimate but not so close that you were rubbing elbows with strangers.



The calamari was tender and breaded to perfection.  The 75 dollar tasting menu with matching wines is exactly what all tasting menus should be.  Lots of food, thoughtfully prepared with exceptional ingredients.  The wines were exceptional and complimented the food to a tee.



Great for dates, romantic without being TOO romantic.  I say this is an excellent place for a group of adults, a first date or a married couple out for a nice meal but don't want to spend 150 a person.

This restaurant is very much a family affair with the wife serving as maitre d, the husband reciting the night's specials and the son serving as our waiter.  We shared a Caesar salad that was disappointing, but our pasta entrees saved the evening.

Just for you to understand my quality level, Maggiano's, an Italian restaurant chain is the bare minimum standard for Italian food.  If I am desperate and want Italian food, I will reluctantly go there..  Macaroni Grill is crap, Olive garden is a joke.  Please don't get me started on CPK. 



Additionally, I only rate food.  I don't care about the environment, if it's hot or cold, if I'm getting hot flashes or not.  I will eat quality food in a blizzard, so long as the arctic winds do not compromise the taste of the food.  



The food is good.  Al dente pasta, tasty.  Very well done.



Service was excellent as well - not that I care about service, but merely pointing it out as a noticeable fact, as 7 different waiters and 4 busboys asked me if there was anything I required.



There have been 2 other restaurants that I have discovered that is just as good.  And both of them are in California.



I have eaten at B&B and it PALES in comparison to Gaetano's.  Sorry Mario Batale, maybe your sou chef was off that night, but I was not pleased with the quality of food.

Gaetano's pulled out all stops - we were given the nice bread basket with olive oil and basalmic, but also a sampler of items including bruschetta, gnocchi with bolognese sauce, spinach ricotta ravioli and butternut squash ravioli with sage and brown butter.  I could tell the pasta is homemade.



They had tons of specials on top of a large menu, and we got a wine special that was really delicious.  My friend and her hubby ordered a salad course, but my guy and I did not mind taking the time to digest our starter treats.  I ordered smoked salmon ravioli with lime shallot cream sauce (a special), and it was delicious!!!  My guy got veal ravioli, my friend got a half order of the spinach ricotta rav and her husband got chicken marsala with gnocchi.



We were treated to tiramasu with a candle and cannolli for my friend's birthday and given an additional discount for her celebration.

ts29,6/14/2010,revtest2938,5,"I was actually a little flabbergasted when I stepped into this restaurant. Who knew such an Italian gem of a restaurant was nesseled in this unassuming strip mall in Henderson?



At first I thought I was a little underdressed for this restaurant. They have white table cloths and the whole setup of wine/water glasses, silverware etc. I felt like I needed to dress up a little bit before I stepped in there. Turns out, I was fine with whatever I was wearing (casual button up with jeans). That's great because I was hungry!



They started off our dinner with a bread basket with 3 different kinds of bread. They also had a balsamic/olive oil dipping plate for our warm toasty bread, that came hot out of the oven.



I took some recommendations from the waiter, Danny. He is definitely a great waiter and just a stand up guy to talk to. He will chat and explain the menu in detail and answer any questions for you. I took a once over of the menu and realized that fried calamari was on their appetizer and had to try it. I was also torn between the Butternut squash ravioli and the homemade Lasagna (both homemade made from scratch in house). I took Danny's recommendation and tried the Lasagna, and I was not dissappointed. 



The Lasagna was so flavorful. Each layer was perfectly cooked and almost melted in your mouth when you took a bite. The cheese that was melted on top was just right and not overcooked. Their sauce was aboslutely delicious and the portion size was just right. 



The calamari was definitely the best I have ever had in Vegas. The batter was not too overwhelming and the crunch was slight and the calamari had great texture. A+ for their lemon half being a mesh package so that the seeds don't fall out over the calamari when squeezing the juice out of it. The little things that make it special.



After dinner, I sat here in amazement by the absolute attention to detail this place has given their food. The dedication to their food is noticeable in their presentation and their taste of each dish presented.

Their service was always on par with plates being cleared and water being refilled. I would highly recommend anyone in the area to try this restaurant. If you have seen it before and just passed it by, please don't and try it for yourselves. I don't think you will be disappointed.  Take a date, bring a friend, bring family.

Thankfully they have moved from Calabasas, CA to Vegas.  We were missing a really phenomenal italian restaurant.  A warm welcome to Mr. Gaetano.  I suggest not wearing jeans, but not crazy decked out either.  I'd say the per person cost is right around $20 - $40 ish, depending on whether or not you get wine.  A date for 2 is $100.",positive

I will definitely be coming back again in the future - it's by far the best Italian I've had in Henderson. 



I agree with everyone that says Gaetano's needs to print a Specials menu! The list of 15 specials was so complicated even our waiter couldn't keep it straight. I love that they have specials, but the confusion of listening to soo many and trying to remember them was annoying. 



We started with beef carpaccio (YUM) and a pretty mediocre bottle of wine. Although I don't blame Gaetano's for the wine - that's my fault for picking the wrong one :)



I had a 1/2 order of the chicken ravioli and a caprese salad for my main. The chicken ravioli was really good - definitely seemed homemade. The caprese was pretty awful. The mozzarella was yummy, but the olive oil was bland, there was no balsalmic, and they called it ""Caprese con pepperoni"" (I guess I'm an idiot for thinking ""con pepperoni"" implies there is pepperoni in the dish?). They had a huge pile of slimy red peppers in the middle and lots of onions. It was a weird rendition of a Caprese - not one I'd ever order again. 



My husband on the other hand got one of the best Italian dishes I've had in my life! I had major jealousy that he got to eat such fabulous food while I was picking at my weird Caprese! It was veal stuffed pasta in a cream sauce with proscuitto and peas. It comes with mushrooms but my freakshow of a husband had them leave those out. Seriously this pasta was incredible!!! Even without the mushrooms this pasta was SO GOOD. The veal was so tender and perfectly flavored. Next time I guess we'll just be getting 2 orders of this fabulousness!!



A wonderful evening with friends and great food. Service was so-so, but the veal stuffed pasta will have me coming back!! Thank goodness it isn't a special and seems to be on the menu full time.",positive
ts29,10/25/2010,revtest2942,5,"My fault for not making reservations and requesting my friend Nick to be our waiter.  However, nothing is like a night out on the town dressed up with Blair B., her husband Mike B., and Eric R.!  We each brought restaurant.com coupons, and ended up using the $50 off $100 (what a deal!)  The coupon includes alcohol.



Mike B. proudly picked the wine with his wine app, so I said we would go with it.  It was okay, but since Blair already said it wasn't her favorite, I will go ahead and agree (I am not much for red wine but did it for my heart, baby!)



We started off with complementary bruschetta, bread and olive oil/basalmic, and the wine.  Gaetano himself gave us the specials, and there were like 42 of them.  Our waiter finally reviewed them with us (though a few were sold out) and we were more confused (the menu is already big as it is).  I ended up getting the butternut squash ravioli with sage and brown butter, and magnificent it was!  The beef carpaccio appetizer was also delicious and at least I can say our waters were refilled rapidly.  Eric R. ordered a veal dish as his main and a half order of the special risotto of the day, bay scallop and shiitake.  It was outstanding and I couldn't stop eating it.



To top it off, my friend Nick sent over via our waiter complementary ""house cappucinos"" which were essentially hot bittersweet chocolate with 3ish liqueurs and topped with whipped cream.  Eric R. was skeptical because he hates coffee and when he tried it, he was relieved.  YUM!",positive
ts29,12/5/2010,revtest2943,4,"Wow. This place is amazing and the wait service is very attentive.



A good friend of mine recommended this place to me when I asked to venture out to an italian restaurant that wasn't part of the Vegas strip and I'm glad he did. Don't let the location fool you because its part of a strip mall next to buffalo wild wings and across from a jewelery store, because once you step in the restaurant the ambiance is warm and if the noise level is right, even couple friendly. 



We started our dish with an appetizer (half order) of veal ravioli. Just the earthiness of the creamy mushroom sauce that accompanied the ravioli dish was very silky that when we had finished the raviolis, we sopped up the remaining of the sauce with our bread....it was that good!



Oh on the bread, it taste freshly made.



For our entree we shared Osso Bucco dish on a bed of safron risotto. The entree portion size here was big and enough for two individuals to share. The Osso Bucco was infused in a deep rich spices and cooked to the point that no knife, not even a butter knife is required. You litterally can cut the meat with your fork or spoon. The Meat on the Osso Bucco was very velvety and taking a spoonful of that with the saffron rissoto made the dish. 



Oh! I can't forget the marrow that is with the osso bucco, if you don't want to eat it with the rest of the dish, spoon it on some of the bread and its like buttery patte. 



As I am writing this review, a week later from our trip to Vegas, my mouth is still watering over this dish....and craving for some osso bucco.",positive

We decided on Gaetano's for our anniversary and we were not let down. The atmosphere is very cozy and warm and the fact that it is family owned adds to the charm. The hostess is a bit gruff but she seem frazzled because they were very busy.  We had dinner on a Saturday at 6:30 p.m. It was already packed!! I would recommend making reservations. We made them on OpenTable. 



Appetizer- We had the half order of chicken ravioli in pesto cream sauce- I would have liked my pasta cooked slightly longer, it was a little undercooked.  The filling and the sauce for this ravioli were absolutely wonderful. I was practically licking the pesto sauce off of the plate. 



Salads- I had the caesar and my husband had the house salad. The caesar was good, just enough dressing, crispy lettuce, fresh croutons. Just a standard salad. The house salad was amazing! Mixed greens with shaved carrots, pine nuts, parmigiano cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. The balance of these ingredients were perfect. I loved it!



Entrees- They have an extensive list of specials as well as an impressive menu consisting of pasta and main entrees. My husband choose to have the Salmon stuffed with Dungeness Crab and I had the New York Steak. The Salmon was seasoned and cooked very well and was delicious. It was served on a bed of orzo with mixed vegetables. I ordered the steak medium and that is how it came out. It was topped with a balsamic reduction. You could really taste the flavor of the meat, it wasn't heavily seasoned. I would have preferred a little more salt and pepper. The steak was served with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. I was impressed with the entrees because the meat in both of our dishes was cooked perfectly. They really had so many things on the menu that looked good!! 



Dessert- We didn't order desert but we were speaking with our waiter, Nick (who is also the owner's son) and mentioned it was our anniversary. He brought us some yummy tiramisu. Mild not too bitter. I don't know if I would order this again, but that is just my desert preference. 



I order wine by the glass, but they have an extensive wine list consisting of full and half-bottles as well as full bar. My husband order GlenFiddich on the rocks. Based on the price, I would have thought it was 15 year, but it was only 12. A little overpriced. The only other thing I didn't really care for was the bread, it didn't seem very fresh to me.



Overall we had a wonderful evening and I hope to return to Gaetano's soon!",positive
ts29,12/13/2010,revtest2945,5,"Like many of the other reviews, I took advantage of the Restaurant.com offer.  You get $50 off but need to spend $100.  



My advice is to wait when they offer 80 or 90% off the Restaurant.com offer.  Normally you can get the $50 coupon for $20 but they offer discounts and then you can get it for just a couple bucks.



Onto the review....



I love this place because of the food and service.  You really feel at home and it does not feel stuffy.   The owner comes by and talks to you about the dishes and gives every table attention.  



We ordered  the following:



Carpaccio di manzo con arugula - Thin slices of raw beef tenderloin with arugula, parmesan cheese, and EVOO.  This was very light and fresh.



Butternut squash Ravioli with Brown butter and Sage  - Very fresh...pasta had that nice bite in texture and the sauce was the boss.  You can also order a smaller portion which is what we did so these were our 2 apps.



Branzino Served Tableside - This was one of the off-the-menu items.  As stated in previous reviews, the restaurant typicaly has 8-10 daily specials.  I recommend def ordering one of them up.  The fish was simple but fresh and good.  A little lemon, EVOO brings out the freshness and taste of the fish.  



Ossobucco served on saffron risotto - the best dish i ve had in months.  so much flavor and you can tell some old lady's been slaving away cooking it in a dutch oven to get all the nice, juicy flavor.  You don't need a knife for the shank and it's so rich but worth it.  The risotto is perfectly cooked.



To round it out, we ordered a side of broccoli rabe, tiramisu (awesome!), coffee, and with tax and tip we were out the door for just under $80.



For the quality of food and service, the meal would have been close to $200 on the strip, but with the coupon we had a great time for a very reasonable price.



We'll be back fo sure!",positive
ts29,1/14/2011,revtest2946,3,"Eh, just Ok. I picked this place because my husbands name in Italian is Gaetano. We walked in and I was immediately impressed. The decor was nice and calm. We were seated and it took quite a few minutes for the busser to come. He acted annoyed when I said regular water was OK instead of bottled. The same annoyed busser brought bread and slammed it down on the table. My husband said it was great though. Our food came reasonably quickly. It was a very modest portion. I am on a fairly strict diet and my appetite is not currently huge. I ordered chicken picatta. It was good, but not great. It was what I call a showgirl portion. After I ate every bite I was still hungry and could have gone elsewhere after. My husband order chicken parm. He said it tasted good, and the sauce on the pasta was great. But the chicken was soggy. He was not full or satisfied after dinner either. We had 2 chicken entrees and 2 glasses of wine. The bill was $68 before the tip. rather pricey to leave still wanting something else. It was OK, but as usual in Vegas there will be no return.",negative
ts29,1/14/2011,revtest2947,4,"We had an urge for italian and wanted to try a new place. Since my bookmarks just seem to keep growing, I decided to check there first. Not suprising, this place showed up.



From outside it looked like a typical strip mall restaurant but after walking through their doors, this place transitioned itself to a bold and elegantly decorated space. The dining tables were spread on a huge open layout, nice tall vaulted celing and dim lighting that set a nice tone.  



What we got:



House Bread and dip: I loved the their plain slices of bread dipped in their olive oil red vinegar. But even better was their stick slices of what I call deep dish pizza with no cheese and just a little tomato sauce. We were off to a nice start!



Bruschetta: small thin toasted slices of bread with garlic, fresh chopped tomato and parmesan + herbs. Very nice but could of done without this, since their House/comp bread was great!



Ravioli di Pollo alla Genovese (homemade chicken ravioli with pesto sauce): chicken was pureed and stuffed in the delicate pasta surrounded by the typical pastel green color pesto sauce. It was Really Good! Only negative was that we felt that a little more chicken in each ravioli would of balance the pasta/filling ratio much better.



Ossobuco alla Milanese (braised veal shank, redwine, fresh herbs, tomato sauce served on a bed of saffron risotto): The Meat was Absolutely Delicious! Only negative is that it wasn't as tender as it could of been, maybe another hour or 2 of slow cookin' should done the trick?! Good size meat portion;although, I've had bigger. Bone marrow was tasty little treat but it was on the small side and filling seemed missing?! The risotto was perfectly cooked, paired with the shank and sauce, was incredible!! 



* I also had a Sterling Cabernet with the Ossobuco and it was splendid :)



Tiramisu (homemade in house): Nicely presented and tasted fantastic. They use an Amaretto type liquor which definitly comes through and was quite unique from what I'm used to. And the texture was on a sharp point! Very nice choice to end a memorable dinner.

ts29,2/18/2011,revtest2948,5,I've been to this restaurant several times and have yet to have anything that was less than excellent.  Tonight I had the eggplant appetizer that is always top notch.

It inspired my first of many yelp reviews.  Definitely eat here if in Henderson or las vegas.,positive
ts29,2/20/2011,revtest2949,4,"I came here with my girlfriend to celebrate Valentine's Day (the Saturday before) and made the reservations through Yelp/Open Table -which worked successfully, if anyone is curious.

I took advantage of the Restaurant.com offer, of course (including a coupon code, therefore getting a $25 certificate for $2 :D)



I heard about the place a long time ago and wanted to try, so finally took advantage of the gift certificate.

The atmosphere is nice (dim, calm and romantic) when you walk in you can see they've won a few awards. I really like the way it is tucked into the corner of the strip mall/area and the way they utilized the space. I felt like it was a place you could find in a more urban area and like I kind of made a discovery.

I could instantly tell this place was family owned, and the owner was very nice (and funny). He seated my girlfriend and I and rattled off all the specials. I liked the guy because he reminds me of some of the family members on my dad's side from ""the old country"", he made sure to cover the details of the specials and addressed any of our questions.

Our waiter was a nice guy too, very personable, answered our questions, helped make suggestions etc. 



Okay onto the food..



The traditional appetizer bread that you get with the meal is awesome. Fresh made, fluffy, warm and tasty. The sticks with marinara were so good and they even offered to bring us more (which we declined because we ordered quite a bit of food).



For the appetizer we had the melon and prosciutto. The prosciutto was a decent cut and was tasty, and the melon was fresh and crispy. Also it was a more generous portion than I expected- we were given 6 good slices of prosciutto and melon.  It was really good, the only thing I would've changed was the melon was really cold (which is understandable because they have to refrigerate the slices/melon I'm sure)- but it can make it hard on sensitive teeth, just a personal preference. Either way, I recommend it.



My girlfriend had the Fettucini Alfredo with shrimp. She raved about it (I am not a fan of heavy cream sauces- particularly Fettucini Alfredo- so I didn't try it) , but it looked very good. The pasta is home-made and had a very nice color to it, and the shrimp were a nice size. She has an Italian background and is familiar with homemade pasta and said it was some of the best she has ever had. 



I had the New York Strip with peppercorn/balsamic reduction. It was VERY good, cooked well and very flavorful. Also, it was a nice cut and large (I cannot remember if he said it was 10 or 12 oz, sorry this was a week ago). The dollop of mashed potatoes along side were delicious, the best I have ever had. The vegetables were o.k. But that balsamic reduction definitely made the meal- the steak was fantastic. Again, it was a generous portion, and I took some home (which is a rare thing for me).



*Just a side note- the Osso Buco here seems to be the hot thing. The table next to us ordered it and it looks fantastic- I don't eat veal, but I'm actually hoping to return and try it*



After eating I had a cappuccino, which although I'm not familiar with, I thought was really good and well-made.



The price was very reasonable- considering the experience, portion sizes and quality of food (especially with the coupon/certificate we had). 



The reason why I gave four stars (and not five) was although the service was friendly and good, it was slow. We were there a good hour and a half (maybe more). It took a long time for our appetizer and longer for our food. Also, my food was fairly cold when I got it (but my girlfriend's was hot). If they can fix that- solid 5.

The place can get  really loud too- which personally I don't mind, it's something I actually enjoy in Italian restaurants (it feels authentic) but if you're looking for a quiet place were you can have a soft conversation I wouldn't recommend a Friday or Saturday night here, we had to talk a bit loud over the crowd. 



In all, it's definitely a new favorite of ours, we're hoping to return soon when we can treat ourselves (maybe on a quieter night where hopefully the service will be quicker) and we would recommend it.",positive

Have been here before and have always enjoyed our experience.  Figured I might as well Yelp about this time.



Had Dinner last night... it was pretty empty ... 3 other tables were sat when we got there... of course, one table did have 10 people at it.



Ambience:  Quiet (unless there's a party of 10 whooping it up next to you)... can be Romantic / Intimate with the low lighting...white table cloths and stealthy servers

Not Fancy... but Not Casual... 



We had brought our own bottle of Prosecco to enjoy at the beginning of the meal and to toast my Mom's b-day.  I think the corkage fee was $15.



They immediately brought out Chilled Flutes and a bucket filled with ice to keep our wine cold....and they continued to refill our glasses til the wine was gone.  :)  



We ordered the Bruschetta to start....

Pretty good... because the tomatoes were juicy... the bread got soggy.  Not the best Bruschetta I've ever had but it was good... give it 3 stars.



My mom and I split the Arugula salad (with goat cheese, pear slivers and candied pecans and a light champagne vinigarette).  

5 stars

Perfect portion to split as we wanted a salad but didn't want a BIG salad to start.  Very tasty... fresh arugula and the the goat cheese was melt in your mouth perfect.



I ordered the Special Stuffed Veal Chop... WOW!  WOW!  WOW!  

5 stars!

It was D-LISH!  And the veal chop was HUGE.  I didn't finish it... took half home.  It was served with parmesan risotto of which... I took 1/2 of that home too.

The chop was stuffed with parm, broccoli rabe, italian sausage and served in their Marsala sauce... SO GOOD!



Mom ordered the Crab Stuffed Salmon which was served on a bed of rice pilaf, sliced carrots and zucchini. I got a taste of hers and it was Very Good... but I liked my stuffed Veal Chop better.

I'd give hers 4.5 stars because I liked mine better.



The husband ordered the Special Pappardelle pasta with Filet Mignon and Shittake mushrooms in a Creamy Marsala sauce.  I got a taste of this too... WOW! 

Definitely 5 stars!

It was rich and so much flavor. The shittake really added another dimension to the dish... of flavor and depth. I really liked his but was enjoying my veal so much that I didn't switch with him... although... I thought about it. Sadly, he ate ALL of his dinner so I don't get his leftovers.



Because it was Mom's b-day... they brought out Tiramisu.  

YUMMMMM!

5 stars

Light... Creamy.... Rich. 

Not overly soaked in coffee ... and Not overly sugar-y....

One of the best Tiramisu's I've had.  My favorite is still the one at Celini's in New York but this one makes top 5.

ts29,4/30/2011,revtest2959,3,"I will start out with the disclaimer that I lived in Italy for 6 glorious months and, consequently, I am a total Italian food snob. I found out about this place from a friend and I was especially pleased to find them on restaurant.com. So my husband and I printed our $50 gift certificate and headed out on a Friday night. I started the meal with the best cosmo I have ever had, it was definitely strong but I didn't taste any alcohol. The bartender is masterful! I then moved on to the bread basket on the table. The regular bread was delicious and warm. There was also an herb, almost pizza looking bread that I was not very fond of, but I am sure somebody enjoys it. I did notice that other tables were getting bruschetta as well as bread, but I got the feeling they were ""regulars,"" but it made me feel left out! We moved on to appetizers. I had the caprese salad, which has roasted peppers and onions on it. I was surprised how well the whole thing worked, given its non-traditional nature. I would definitely recommend it! For the main courses, I had the papardelle with filet and my husband had the trout special. The pasta was delightful and the filet was melt in your mouth delicious, but the dish was missing something. It was earthy and rustic but there was a flavor profile missing for sure. The trout was well cooked, but the skin of the fish was not at all crispy and we felt it should have been. It came with a side of pasta that was delicious! Since we had the restaurant.com coupon we decided to go all out and get a dessert. We decided to go out on a limb and try the Sicilian cannoli. The cannoli was almost inedible. It has an overwhelming lemon flavor and is just very off-putting texturally. 



The service was wonderful, until the end of the meal. The restaurant had filled up very fast and people were asking to be seated in our server's section. The poor man was running from table to table! It took us over 15 minutes to get someone to swipe our credit card so we could leave, but other than that small ordeal the service was impeccable. Overall, it was a mixed bag for us.

ts29,5/27/2011,revtest2960,5,"My husband and I frequent this place; we go once or twice a month on the average.  Gaetano's is great Italian food with an excellent wine list.  Best of all, Gaetano's is in our neighborhood!  The food has great flavor. Meats are always served to our desired doneness. Seafood and poultry items on the menu are juicy and tender. Pasta is cooked al dente while the sauces always make me want to lick my plate clean!  I love listening to their specials although you can't go wrong ordering from the menu. I recommend the burrata, the baked artichoke stuffed with Parmesan (an occasional special), the mushroom soup (also a special) and caprese for starters, the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini for pasta, and the Ossobuco alla Milanese for your entree, the tiramisu for dessert paired with THE cappuccino (not the regular one but the owner's own recipe).  Then again, like I said, you can't go wrong with any item from the menu.



I most especially like the feeling that the restaurant exudes.  You can certainly feel the welcome from the family that runs the place. The service is very personal. Nick who is often our server, treats us very well.  I also enjoy small talks with his father who is usually the host for the evening when he comes around to the tables. The floor plan and lighting make you feel cozy. It is not too small as to constrict you nor is it too big that it loses the intimacy.  I can come in shorts and flip-flops or in a little black satin dress and I'd be fine.  They send you a gift certificate for a free dinner to celebrate your birthday which is redeemable within your birth month. They often email you discount coupons too.  Occasionally, the restaurant will have set dinner menu pairing events hosted by wineries which are well worth the price because they are often generous with their pours and with pour refills.

We're fond of the warm cabbage salad, but tonight we opted for the special arugula with goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette split.  My wife devoured the barramudi with chopped tomato and I coasted along with a risotto with chicken and asparagus.  Perfect mid-week meal.

The food is astoundingly good and puts other 'family style italian gardens' absolutely to shame.

No matter what, make a reservation. They won't let the place get crowded enough that you can't get service. 



The bar is wonderful. My sister-in-law and I spent an entire night making up martinis with the bartender. It was so much fun. The bartenders are totally engaging and enjoy making new and interesting drinks.

ts29,8/8/2011,revtest2965,3,"Checked this out with a chef friend of mine.  Nothing to really complain about at this place but nothing that blew me away.



I had the short rib dish - the short ribs were cooked well though it was kind of messing the melt in your mouth texture I like.  Might have been the short ribs themselves rather than the way it's cooked.  Came with a blah gnocci I didn't really like or hate.  Just blah.

My chef buddy had some pork special.  It was ok - but again nothing special.  Pork breaded and wrapped with something.  Just wasn't great.



Also ordered a side of spaghetti and marinara.  Nothing special - again.



Dessert was apple pie a la mode.  That was actually very nice.  Rich, flaky, great crust.



Not sure this place can justify the prices without a bit more flavor.",negative
ts29,9/22/2011,revtest2966,3,"Let me start off by saying that the ONLY reason this restaurant is getting three stars from me is because the food was actually good. If I rated the service, they would not even get one star. 



We had tried this restaurant when it first opened so many years ago, but had not been back since...until last night. My husband made reservations through reservations.com, and asked for a quiet, corner table as we were celebrating our anniversary. Our reservations were for 6:45 PM and the place wasn't very crowded at the time. After arriving, a waiter greeted us as he was stretching over to assist the people at another table. He grabbed a couple of menus and seated us (didn't ask if we had a reservation). Therefore, we were seated at a table between a couple with an irritable young child and a group of people that were pretty loud. We had to talk above normal levels just to hear each other. After being ditched by our waiter, we were finally served bread and water. More waiting as we are basically sitting, there as our waiter was tending to the tables around us, passing us by, barely glancing at us. This was the theme throughout the night. 



We finally got our appetizer (delivered by a different server), which was a very good antipasto platter. Perfect for two people and had very good flavors. Our main courses were equally as good. I had a homemade butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sage sauce. It was excellent. My husband had their pork special, which he enjoyed as well. I do have to give compliments to the chef. We would have had dessert (since it was a special occasion), but the 45 minute wait after we finished eating was just a little annoying. Again, our waiter walked by us several times, not looking at us, just tending to his other customers. Oh, the owner or manager did come over to us and said our last name with a question like he was confirming our reservation. Then he left and the next time we saw him was to ask for our check. 



We decided to go have our anniversary dessert at Crepe Shack and Waffles...much better service! 



Will we go back...probably not. There are too many good Italian restaurants in Henderson to try that have much better service.",negative
ts29,9/25/2011,revtest2967,5,"The service was excellent (maybe because I went when there weren't that many people there. The food was AMAZING! I had the veal raviolli. It didn't taste gamey at all, and the sauce was amazing.

ts29,10/22/2011,revtest2969,5,"Amazing food and amazing service.  What more can you ask for?



I went here last night to celebrate a birthday for my girlfriend and was seated immediately since the rush hasn't started yet. The restaurant seemed like the perfect place for our date that evening.  Romantic and classy.  Exactly what I was looking for.



Our waiters took our drinks and told us a long list of specials they for the night. That speech took at least 3 minutes.  I guess they were really trying to push the specials.



Before I get onto the food I want to comment on the service and overall experience.



Service:

- Fantastic. We were checked up on my our waiter and his trainee many times throughout dinner. Usually restaurants check up on you 2-3 times throughout the dinner and we would have to flag them down the rest. But not here.  Another thing that caught my attention was the owner walked around mingling with the customers the entire night.  He looked content and caring.



-  You have to wait for your food here. Each of our courses had at least 15-20 minutes in between (Including the time you eat that course); as it should be. We ordered around 6:40pm, received our antipasto at 6:50, then received our mussels at 7:20 and so on.  I'm not saying this is bad at all, but if you're in a hurry don't eat here. They make quality food here and if you're just going to rush through and scarf it down you mine as well just grab a burger from Wendy's down the street.



Experience:

- I really enjoyed that dinner. The food was fantastic and not too salty. I actually prefer this place over Maggiano at the Fashion Show Mall. It seems like ""real"" Italian food. Not the fancy dishes they serve you at the high quality Italian restaurants at MGM Casino or the Americanized Italian food at Maggiano or Buca di Beppo. This restaurant pulls quality and authentic Italian style cooking, stirs it up, and serves it onto a plate for you to indulge in.  Also, go to restaurant.com to get a coupon. My four course meal for two people was $121, but my coupon was for $50 off $100, so the bill was for $70 not including an automatic 18% gratuity for using the coupon.  So all together, $90 for a four course high quality meal? Not bad. Not bad at all.



Food:



- Appetizers:

 Carpaccio di manzo con argula e parxnigiano (Beef carpaccio and arugala with parmesan cheese shavings)  $15



I actually really liked this carpaccio when comparing it to many of the other places in Las Vegas At Brio in Town Square they use an aioli which I'm not too fond of. I really like the taste of the beef and the extra aioli hides that flavor. However, the carpaccio is not as good as the one at FiAMMA at the MGM Casino (Their secret ingredient is truffles so they automatically have the upper hand).



 Insalatta della casa (House salad) $9



A basic house salad with a nice sweet balsamic vinaigrette.



- Hot Appetizers

 Brodetto (Clams and mussels in a white wine tomato broth) $15



This smelled and tasted great. However, the bread was supposed to be dipped into the broth and eaten but the broth was too salty to consume with the toast.  I don't think I'll order this one again.



Main Course:



 Mezzelune di Vitello con porcini (A half moon type of ravioli filled with veal) $19



This tasted fantastic. It takes the cake from all other Italian restaurants I've been too. The cream sauce was not too salty, the filling was nice and smooth, and the extra peas and prosciutto added a nice flavor to every bite.



 Ossobucco alla Millanese (Braised veal shank on saffron risotto) $32



This was my first time I had ossobucco and to be honest I only got it because it was basically the most expensive item on the menu and I wanted to be able to use my $50 off $100 coupon.  I don't regret getting this dish at all. The veal fell apart when I dug into it with my fork; a good sign that it was braised for a while.  And the saffron risotto was nice and creamy.



Dessert:



 Tiramisu $?



My girlfriend and I weren't really a fan for this one. The tiramisu at Maggino seemed better.  The only upsetting part about this cake was the lady fingers.  Despite them being soaked with liquid it still felt kind of dry and rough when swallowed.  Maybe I'm just used to eating the one at Maggiano and I don't know what real Tiramisu should be like.



 Gaetano's specialty martini $9



I didn't really like it. The texture was nice; bubbly and still had some floating crystals of ice.  But there was a similar remarkable scent from one of those discs that they put in the urinals so that it doesn't smell. I couldn't get past that. Also, it could have been sweeter.



That pretty much wraps it up.  I would definitely go here again as it's probably my top Italian restaurant now.",positive
ts29,10/23/2011,revtest2970,4,"This little gem in Henderson made me (yes, me!) like mushroom ravioli!  Our waiter was amazing and sold me on the homemade ravioli with sausage, mushroom and asparagus and I loved it!  We started off with the wonderful stuffed dates appetizer and arugula salad.  I had a bite of my friend's pasta with vodka sauce which was also amazing!  We ended the night with their tiramisu, and I wish I had saved room.  What a wonderful place- great service and amazing food!  Check it out!",positive
ts29,11/5/2011,revtest2971,5,"I scheduled a birthday dinner here last minute due to unmet needs at another restaurant. Never been there until that night, but I heard from my supervisor that the food is really good. I can celled my other reservation and called them to see if they could take my group on such a short notice. When I called, I spoke to the manager who was completely understanding and helped me set up the reservation. I ended up being really satisfied! 1. They accommodated me and my guests and 2. They were genuinely nice to my friends and me. I really enjoyed my dinner here. I brought a cake with me and they lit the candles and brought it out to me. As well as cut the cake and served it. They really do care about their customers here. It's more like family here. The food was really good too. I had penne pasta which was really tasty and cooked just right. I still hear from my guests that they enjoyed the food and service here and this was a year ago! At the time, they were able to split checks. Which is one of the reasons why I dumped the other place. They tried to pull a quick one on me and tell me they couldn't do it the day of my dinner, even though previously they said they would. I am SO glad I chose to go to Gaetano's! I would definitely recommend this place. It's not cheap, but it's really good and the workers are super nice!",positive
ts29,11/7/2011,revtest2972,4,"MMMMMMMM!!! thats all i have to say about this place. i could say for a Saturday night they could have a bit more servers working, but it acutally ended up working out. cuz with all the food we ordered the time it took for it to come out was just the right amount to let us rest in between. 

sooo good, will def be back!!",positive

The owners makes sure to make",positive
ts29,11/23/2011,revtest2975,5,"I'm so thankful this great restaurant is just a couple of miles from my home.   Five friends and I had dinner here last week and it' hasn't changed in several years.  My husband and I used to go there a couple times a month and never had anything short of an excellent meal and excellent service.   We loved the ambience; romantic, classy and quiet.



The service and food are still top notch and we stayed for 3 hours because we were so comfortable and conversation was a pleasure without the noise.   Our reservations were for 6 PM (via Open Table) and we were seated immediately.



Drinks all around were well made and ample.  Since we're close friends we usually split the bill among us so the server suggested an antipasto plate for the table in lieu of salads. .  It was  perfect, we devoured it.  We let the kitchen choose what went on the plate and they chose well.



Cindy ordered the short ribs and said they were outstanding.   Beef was very tender and delicious.



Maureen's Veal Marsala (she made me taste it) was out of this world.  Great taste, awesome sauce.



Sandy ordered Eggplant Parmegianno and said it was the best she'd had.   Lorraine and Jeannette orderded Angel Hair pasta topped with chicken.   They were very pleased.



I had the Veal Picatta but requested a side of Risotto Milanese (saffron rice with loads of parmegianno cheese).  This wasn't on the menu but they graciously accomodated me.  I'm high maintenance.  LOL.  Needless to say that was a wise choice.  The veal was fork tender, melt-in-your-mouth delicious with a sauce that had the right amount of lemon and butter.  Not enough capers to suit me but I'm a caper lover so......oh and the best cosmo this side of Brio Tuscan Grill.  



We usually go to another Italian Restaurant every New Year's Eve but decided we needed to go back to Gaetano's so after 5 years we now have a new place to frequent. 



Just a word about the courtesy of the staff; even though everyone had left, we stayed (maybe overstayed) our welcome and continued to  have a great conversation without anyone seeming to be in a hurry to get us out.  They quietly went about what they were doing and told us to take our time.   Thank you staff for being so nice and understanding.   We really didn't want to leave.",positive
ts29,1/1/2012,revtest2976,5,"Updated to include dinner New Year's Eve at Gaetano's.   The Ossobuco was absolutely  fantastic.   Very tender, very flavorful and of course the marrow is the crowning glory.   Missed the traditional gremolata (garlic/parsley/lemon zest sprinkled over the shanks) but other than that it was perfect.  It was served over pasta, but again being the traditionalist when it comes to Ossobuco I asked for and got Risotto Milanese and it too was perfect.   Two others in my group ordered the same and they loved it.

I love that the owner always makes it a point to talk to the patrons and maybe josh with them a little.  He always makes himself visible and available and if you need anything, or make substituions he's there and ready to accomodate. Nice touch.",positive
ts29,1/18/2012,revtest2977,4,"We ate at Gaetano's last night.  Mr. Gaetano was not working last night but he has two sons that do.  The waiter (the loud son) was engaging and passionate about the food and the off menu specials.



We started with a buffalo mozzarella salad that was very tender and fresh.  We shared a stuffed artichoke that was delicious and reminded me of my grandmothers.  We ordered a rib eye (with all the fat cut off), veal rav, veal parm and eggplant pasta dish.  All were great.",positive
ts29,2/4/2012,revtest2978,4,"The Groupon I had for this place was burning a hole in my pocket (er phone) so I decided to take my fella and mom here for dinner last night. 



We came in around 7 and the place wasn't too packed. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated quickly. Almost immediately our drink orders were taken and a minute after that our server greeted us and welcomed us to the restaurant. He came back a few minutes later to give us a rundown on all the specials for the evening. The list was definitely extensive. Probably would benefit them to write them down since the waiter was forced to list about 15 different specials which a bit time consuming, but still informative. 



I was debating between the pappardelle and the gnocchi, but I ended up going with the gnocchi. My fella ordered the chicken ravioli and my mom got the lasagna. The bread was really good and they were very generous with the quantities. We started with the artichoke heart appetizers, which was great. Our food took quite a bit of time to come out. We were left waiting for a really long time, but our server was extremely apologetic for the delay however. The food finally came out and everyone was extremely pleased with their meals.

This place is my absolute favorite italian restaurant so far in Vegas, and one of my fav overall places as well! The food has always been delicious, as well as authentic and freshly made meals. The service is excellent as well! I love the ambiance here, and the fact that its run by a sweet italian family!! It kinda reminds me of being home I think :) The son is usually our server, but last night i took the BF out to dinner on date night the dad came over to say hello, explain the specials, and the wine list....the BF isnt the biggest wine drinker so he helped us pick out a bottle that he and I would both enjoy, and i have to say we both thought it was delicious!  I try to make myself get something different each time I eat here because everything is always so good, but I am so in love with the gorgonzola gnocchi....i think about it every day I'm dieting!!! haha...  Its really nice to see a REAL italian, family-run restaurant in the area...I hope they continue to do good business!!",positive

ts29,2/19/2012,revtest2981,3,"No doubt lots of good reviews on Gaetanos. Just went there for the first time. More formal and maybe 'upscale' than I thought it would be (double contrasting tablecloths, candles, wine glasses pre-set, waiters in ties, etc.). Nice decor, just not what I was expectin.. But enough of that, we were there to eat. The menu was OK. Basic staples of Italian not to be found,,,Spag and Meatballs, Chicken Parm, and others) This was more of an upscale menu (and prices), just like the decor. Lot's of veal, lot's of 'specials'. We got Bolognese and Chicken Marsala. Overall, we thought it was OK, but with so many good Italian restaurans in H-Son, did not seem to stand above, or equal to many. Nice to try once, but not for us. Service was good.",negative
ts29,2/20/2012,revtest2982,5,"The service is outstanding and the food is even better. I have a new appreciation for the quality of the food as well as the authentic style Gaetano applies to his cooking. I loved this place before I traveled to Italy and I'm more impressed with the food after I spent 5 days trying authentic Italian food. 



This is a place I would recommend to anyone who doesn't want to pay ""Vegas Strip"" prices, but enjoys the quality of fine food.",positive
ts29,3/10/2012,revtest2983,5,"So normally when I come to Las Vegas, I dine like most other vacationers in town for the weekend. Brunch buffets, food courts lunches and an occasional overpriced dinner in one of the casinos on the Strip. Sometimes I make it to the Main Street Station 777 Steakhouse Grill downtown which I think is one of the best bargains in Vegas.



So when I friend told me that he had a place in mind for dinner on the outskirts of town in Henderson, I was more than happy to oblige. He had raved about Gaetano's before and I was eagerly awaiting to see what all the fuss was about, and also spend an evening away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.



The great thing about this place is it's a family owned establishment with more locals than tourists eating there. It feels like a place that you would actually go out to for a nice dinner if you lived in the area! The owners are extremely friendly and chatted with us before bringing out our appetizer, a plate of assorted cheeses, bruschetta, olives, assorted bread basket and a delicious centerpiece of fresh mozerella drizzled with balsamic vinegar atop a bed of fresh arugula. The cheese will literally melt in your mouth, leaving you to crave another three or four pieces. But fear not, then there are the entrees...



Our waiter Nick was extremely friendly and knowledgable, and explained the specials to us in extreme detail, and they all sounded delicious. We could tell that he is very passionate about the food at Gaetano's. My friend ordered the chicken-asparagus risotto (off the regular menu), which he said was delicious. I also ordered off the main menu, mostly because of the rave reviews that the Ossu Bucco has gotten at this place. When it came, my eyes practically popped out of my head. What you had was an enormous shank of meat complete with the bone marrow sitting atop a bed of saffron risotto. I went straight for the marrow, spreading it onto the bread. That first bite may be one of my top 5 of all time. The shank was tender and delicious, smothered in what looked to be a tomato and red wine reduction sauce. It all went perfectly with the rich and delicious saffron risotto (who even thinks of such a thing?!?!). Needless to say by the end of the meal every last bit of marrow had been sucked from the bone, and by the last sip of my glass of house red wine I was practically in heaven. Oh yeah, and then there was the creme brulee with fresh strawberries that was one of the best I've ever had. So in order to sum everything up...



If you are ever in Vegas, GO TO GAETANO'S YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!

This family owned and operated Italian restaurant is amazing. Everyone is extremely friendly and treats everyone as if they've known you forever. The owner, Gaetano Palmeri, is always walking around to ask if your dining experience is good and will even go over the daily specials personally. His family is very nice and you can't find a better personality than, Danny!

The food is amazing! The Seafood/Pasta special (I always forget the name...) is my favorite. The Crab stuffed Salmon, Stuffed Lamb Chop and veal are awesome too. The have a great wine list and also host a monthly wine dinner pairing that is great. It's not Olive Garden or Carrabbas, so expect to pay a little more but it won't break you.",positive

ts29,4/26/2012,revtest2986,5,This is our favorite restaurant period. The staff is friendly and more importantly the food is fantastic. If you are in a rush this is not the place to go. If you want really good authentic Italian food then this is the place.,positive
ts29,5/9/2012,revtest2987,5,"Absolutely blown away by this place. I'm usually not interested in most specials at restaurants, but *every* *single* special I heard when I was there sounded mouth watering. I had a pappardelle pasta with sliced filet mignon, porcini mushrooms in a mushroom Marsala wine sauce and I thought I died and went to heaven. The decor & atmosphere is simply stunning. Service is fine dining level. The owners son waited on us and he's really a great dude. They make all their own pastas, stocks, and sauces in house. The slightly higher prices are TOTALLY worth it. A must go!!!",positive
ts29,5/14/2012,revtest2988,4,"We ate our first meal there recently (four of us).  Everyone truly enjoyed the food.  If you're not too price sensitive, I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Even if you are price sensitive, I still recommend it, at least for special occasions.  Four pasta dishes, one salad, and a $30-something bottle of wine, tax and tip worked out to an average of ~$40 per person.  That's more than we normally want to spend on a meal, even a relatively good one, but the more I think about it the more I come to the conclusion that the quality of the whole experience was worth the price.  Even though we probably won't eat there often, I am sure we will eat there again.  



Although our server didn't smile much his service was very professional, knowledgeable, efficient, and attentive.  The restaurant seemed to be on target with their reservations.  Everyone who came in seemed to be seated promptly although the restaurant remained pretty full.  The tables are well spaced and spacious.  Everything was clean.  Although it was busy, there were no significant distractions during our meal.  Although TVs showing sports could be seen in the bar, they are separated from the dining room by glass and therefore were not audibly disruptive to diners.  Gaetano's seems like it would be a good place to take a date.  



I thought about details of Gaetano's compared with other Italian restaurants in the immediate neighborhood.  [Each of the other restaurants has negatives, including things like uncomfortable tables/chairs, sports on TV that can be seen and heard in the dining area, having to wait too long to be seated, tables being too close together, too much noise, etc., whereas Gaetano's had none of those problems.]  Gaetano's seems to have put a lot of effort into the whole experience, not just the food.



Note:  For many people this probably would have been a 5-star review.  I give 4 stars (would be 4-1/2 if given that option) only because of my personal preference not to spend quite so much money.",positive
ts29,6/15/2012,revtest2989,4,"I'm not really into Italian food but this place is pretty authentic. 



We came here on a restaurant.com coupon for 25.00 and we heard so many good reviews about this place. We pretty much knew what we wanted to order based on other yelpers reviews. To start we ordered the Carpaccio which was topped with arugula and Parmesan cheese, drizzled with olive oil. The beef was cut paper thin and the peppery taste of the arugula along with the salty Parmesan was a perfect combination. The one thing that stood out for my was the olive oil which was very fragrant and can tell it was high quality. For our entrees we ordered the Ossobuco and the Ravioli stuffed with butternut squash. The Ossobuco was stewed in a red sauce which had deep flavors served over a saffron risotto. It was fork tender but the highlight of the dish was the bone marrow, it added so much richness to the dish. The Ravioli stuffed with butternut squash was my favorite. The pasta was cooked brilliantly because the filling to pasta ratio was perfect. I was served with a brown butter sauce with sage. Just the smell of the sage made this dish stand out. 



Overall this place was really good. It was pretty crowded on an early Friday evening so reservations are recommended. I would definitely come back and try their other pasta dishes and deserts.",positive

We stumbled upon this place based on a Groupon they had offered, it had good reviews, so we decided to try it.  People were up a the bar watching the Heat finals, which looked rather comfortable, and has been added to my places to watch games that don't involve gambling. I ordered a dirty martini on the rocks [very good] he ordered a cranberry and vodka that came out looking like pink lemonade b/c they pour heavy here!!! {A+}



I got the Burrata salad which just makes me grin from ear to ear. My friend actually got the Gazpacho which shocked the shit out of me, as that was very daring for him, and he ate it all. I was allowed to have one tasty bite and that was it.  Bread basket arrived with all sorts of wholesome goodness in there-got to love carbs.

I like that they bring out foccassia bread as well as regular Italian bread.



The quality of the food is very very good, you can tell its homemade and not frozen/canned/premade, the portions are just super small which generally is the case with fine dining. I would return, but probably just on a date on with family. If I was going out with a friend I'd go to Brio for happy hour. Definitely worth trying, but don't expect Buca portions.",positive

My only complaint concerns their business practice of including an 18% tip in your bill, even for a party of two. It's even worse when the check comes back for your signature, with another ""tip"" line and no total. It invites unintentional double tipping if you missed that it was included prior to getting the signature copy. On our last visit we met new friends and enjoyed some small talk through diner. When the checks came I suggested they check for the tip. They were appalled and would have double tipped by accident if I hadn't mentioned it. The waiters earn a good tip, so that isn't the problem. But I wonder if an ""overtip"" goes to the waiter? How many people would catch this? On a check of $150, tipping twice can be a substantial hit.  I usually see a sign when a restaurant includes the tip. On the menu and at the register it reads something like ""A gratuity of 18% is included for parties of 5 or more.""  I hope they reconsider this practice. I have complained, but it hasn't changed yet and keeps me from giving them 5 stars.",positive

Only 3 figs so we had to split the last one (otherwise a fight)  delicious.  Mr. had the spaghetti and meatballs, normally he would have never ordered spaghetti but the meatballs made up for it.. large and absolutely delicious.  I had mushroom ravioli, light and creamy and not overpowering. The dining room was busy for 530p on a Wednesday night but service was still there.  I presented the groupon and when they brought the bill explained 18% tip was included. Nothing was hidden.  So after the groupon and the tip we still owed another 42.00 which was worth it.  The hostess did come over to bring change back (which we declined) and also said another groupon was out as of today 9-12.. Went home and bought another groupon.  A real gem found in a strip mall.",positive

Try this place if you're looking for some delicious Italian pasta.",positive
ts29,9/27/2012,revtest2999,5,"This could be my new favorite place to grab a drink and eat at the bar. There is something about eating at a bar that I really enjoy, and I loved the ambiance here. Had a groupon to use, my friend and I were dressed casual, when we arrived we felt slightly under dressed to sit in the dining area (I'm sure they wouldn't have mind but out of respect for the owners who were walking around) we decided to sit at the bar. It sat about 10-15 people, had two TV's, dark lighting with candle on the bar, a friendly bartender and a large wine list and specialty cocktail list. The bread basket was filled with soft, tasty bread and a side of oil AND vinegar (I appreciate it when balsamic is added to the olive oil). We ordered the prosciutto stuffed figs with arugula that went perfectly with my Sauvignon Blanc, it was delicious. The menu was extensive, filled with the usual Italian favorites, one in particular, cioppino, which I will come back to try. When the bill came, our bartender informed us that an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill PRIOR to the discount, which I don't think is a big deal like other people have complained about in other reviews, I'm sure it's to help prevent the cheap skates from not tipping properly. If you read your Groupon you would see prior to purchasing it, it states it plain and simple. Will definately return.",positive
ts29,10/22/2012,revtest3000,5,"Molto bueno!  

I am always looking for a great Italian restaurant.  I have found some quality places in town, but they were not perfect.  I think that Gaetano's is the closest I have found to perfect in town.



I lived in Italy when I was younger; thus, I am an Italian food snob where I turn down my nose at those chain places.  



DH and I went last night.  Groupon offered a great deal, but they also have deals on their website.



I have a glass of pinot grigio, the pear and pecan salad, and gnoochi con gorgonzola.  The rate of how good an Italian restaurant is whether they have gnoochi and how good it is.  While, admittedly, my gorgonzola sauce is better, it's the best I have had in Las Vegas.  Also, the gnoochi was perfect little dumplings from heaven.



DH had the portabello mushrooms app and ravioli entree.  He enjoyed both, but said he would try a different pasta next time.  I had a tiny bit of his mushrooms and found them to be yummy.  I have to say that I completely ignored his main dish because I was too focused on my gnoochi.



While I didn't finish my gnoochi (dinner tonight!), I had a cup of cappuccino before leaving.  The taste was perfect!  



Fantastic memories of Italy were brought to mind when dinning at this fine establishment.  We will definiately be returning!



Staff was friendly.  Kept DH's drink full, offered more bread, and generally checked on us regularly.  One note for groupon users: they automatically added 18% tip on bill, which was fine with me, but FYI.",positive
ts29,10/24/2012,revtest3001,5,place is awesome.. just tell them what you like and let them figure it out.. it works well.  If you're really picky.. just go to a strip casino buffet instead.,positive
ts29,10/25/2012,revtest3002,4,"We have been to Gaetano's several times.  It's amazing, but pricey.  Look for a Groupon or Restaurant.com coupon to help defray the cost.  Zach was our favorite server too (like Sarah said), but he quit to go back to school.  Server this last time (who didn't give his name) was very knowledgeable, but not much personality.  The food is amazing though!  We had the baked artichoke appetizer.  My wife had the Fettuccine Alfredo, which was with homemade noodle and it was good.  The real winner was my homemade sausage ravioli, which was sublime.  Only the somewhat snooty service and high prices keep this place from 5 stars.",positive
ts29,10/26/2012,revtest3003,4,"We were visiting friends in Las v\Vegas and they took us to their favorite restaurant - a place for special occasions. They were right!



I was told the homemade meatballs, made with filet mignon and veal,  were the best - and they were! A special was the Branzino over a vegetable Rosotta - delicious! I just wish they had provided a larger portion!

ts29,11/5/2012,revtest3005,4,"Great little place (way) off the strip, I love italian food, and this place wasn't too bad. I came here with my girlfriend and split a carpaccio dish, veal with shiitake mushrooms, and a gnocchi dish with her. I don't eat veal a lot, but I was a little surprised at how it came out; the sauce and mushrooms were great, along with the steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes it came with, but for some reason the veal just wasn't what I was picturing in my head. Don't let that deter you though, that might just be how veal is, and I didn't know it. 



The gnocchi was excellent, very flavorful with the gorgonzola sauce, and it was hard to stop eating even though I was already stuffed. 



The waitstaff were excellent as well! Our personal waiter wasn't that friendly and seemed a little scatterbrained, but all the other people on the floor more than made up for it. I'm pretty sure some of the people that stopped to talk to us were either the owner or the manager. and the hostess was most helpful in calling a cab for us and then letting us know when it arrived.",positive

The waiter was informative about the menu and very helpful in making our choices amongst all the great-sounding meals. There are familiar dishes on the menu...and some very unique as well. I had a creamy pumpkin soup (with the spices just right), and fish cooked perfectly with a light, yet flavorful sauce. The wines were varied, and my very affordable Cabernet was rich and smooth. 



This is the type of restaurant, that if I lived nearby, I can see it becoming a regular!",positive

It was somewhat of a small portion, yet I was full with the salad and meal. The service was great and I will definitely be back",positive
ts29,12/4/2012,revtest3008,4,"Gaetano's has a very pleasant and relaxing atmosphere.   The staff was very knowledgeable of menu items and provided good service.  



I ordered the asparagus risotto special.  The risotto was delicious and well seasoned.  The restaurant could have stepped it up a little and put a garnish of grilled asparagus or something to make the dish visually appealing.   My husband had the rolled pork special.  The flavor was OK.  He gave me a bite of the pork.  You could hardly taste the pork as it was overwhelmed by the amount of bread stuffing inside.  The sauce should have been nappe and it was overly thick.  This was a little disappointing which is why we took away one star.  Overall though, it was a good experience and we would probably go back.



The restaurant was a  little pricey for the quality of food served.",positive
ts29,12/6/2012,revtest3009,4,"We were given a Groupon by a friend to check out Gaetano's. We never go to Henderson so it was nice to make a trip out that way. I love Italian food, obviously, so I was excited to try a new place. It was a pretty slow Sunday night and we were seated fairly quickly. Nice traditional italian menu and I would call it an ""upscale casual"" restaurant. I was impressed with the ""Specials"" they offered, however there were several options and they were all so detailed that by the time the server finished explaining them all I couldn't remember what most of them were. Would be nice to have them printed up somewhere on the table.

On to the food:

We ordered the burrata cheese salad which was one of the appetizer specials. It was a delicious little salad. Emphasis on ""little"". For the price it definitely was a bit small. We love burrata cheese so were excited to have some as it is difficult to find. There was one small piece on the salad and since we split it, it wasn't much. I believe it was around $11-12 dollars too which for an appetizer salad is pricey. Good, but pricey!

I ordered linguini with red clam sauce as my entree, my absolute favorite dish to order at any Italian restaurant. It was very tasty and made just right. Quick note for one of the servers assistants... when a guest asks for parmesean cheese, they don't need you to tell them ""oh, I wouldn't put it on that"" .... just get me the cheese. Thanks :)

All in all, good experience, nice servers and well maintained restaurant. Doubt I'll be back but that's only because it's pretty far from me and I can get good Italian close to home.",positive
ts29,1/20/2013,revtest3010,5,"One of the best Italian places in the Vegas Valley area (for me, it's right up there with Nora's and Casa di Amore). Most times I'm in here, Gaetano and/or his wife are walking around talking to diners, seating people, taking orders, or monitoring the kitchen activities. Most of the servers are their sons or other family members. The dining room is big; I almost never make a reservation, and even so I've been able to get right in with 1-3 other people on Friday & Saturday evenings without a wait. The food is always amazing, and unlike some other places where the ""specials"" are old food they're trying to get rid of, Gaetano's specials are things he's been able to get a hold of and offer in limited supply, or just something he felt like making on a whim that day. There are always around 10 specials daily, and the waiters are amazing in their ability to rattle off every one of them with every ingredient and preparation along with it. I've never been let down by their food or their service. It's definitely more expensive than the Olive Gardens of the world, but it's totally worth it, and I can usually get 2-3 meals out of any pasta dish I'd order there. They also offer deals on Restaurant.com that you can use once a month and help you to savor their deliciosity without making your wallet too sad.



Some of the best things I've had here are their penne a la vodka (I'm a sucker for a good vodka sauce, and theirs is one of my favorites); a special that pops up every so often that's pappardelle pasta, filet mignon tips, and shiitake mushrooms in a marsala sauce; a caprese-type salad made with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese (frequently on the list of specials); and their eggplant parmesan. When they offer fish dishes, they're always very fresh (I haven't ordered one myself but my mom has gotten fish the couple of times she's come here with me, and of course I always snag at least one bite of everyone else's dish at the table... if you dine with me, prepare to share the love!). They have a good-sized wine list with both by-the-bottle and by-the-glass options. The bread you get in the beginning with olive oil & balsamic is so good I have to stop myself from eating too much & spoiling my dinner. I always leave here fat & happy.",positive
ts29,2/8/2013,revtest3011,5,"Went back again on a week day. There were about 3 other parties besides mine there, so service was amazing! I tried their special for the day: seafood linguini. Holy MOLY!! It was SOOOO DELICIOUS! There were lobster, crab, clams, muscles, shrimp, calamari, scallops, oh my is right! The flavor was perfect: not too fishy despite having the whole Atlantic in my meal, the sauce wasn't too rich so I could keep eating without getting tired of it, and the meal itself was ginormous. I ate for about 30 minutes straight and didn't make a dent in it. My leftovers fed my boyfriend and I for 2 days!! MmmMMmm =P Plus, I was able to watch the basketball game that was playing in the bar section. What a perfect dinner!

We have really enjoyed our dining experiences here. The only criticism I have is that the prices are a bit high, even by Vegas standards.  $18 for gnocchi? The gnocchi are pretty good but I've had way better and for more reasonable prices.",positive
ts29,2/26/2013,revtest3013,4,"My wife and I ate at Gaetano's last night.  The restaurant was fairly easy to find, located right on Eastern Ave., though you may miss it if looking, as there's another business that's in front of it (obscuring it from the street).  I liked the decor, it was simple but elegant.  



It took our waiter a few minutes to stop by to review the nightly specials, but not excessive.  Our waiter was friendly and had helpful recommendations when prompted.  



My wife ordered the rigatoni with a sausage meat-sauce, I ordered the chicken piccata.  My wife's dish could have used a tad more sauce, and I would have thought my dish would have come with a side of pasta of some kind.  While both our dishes were very tasty, portion sizes were smaller than I expected; perhaps Italian portion sizes are just smaller here in Vegas compared to what I'm used to (we're from Boston, where portion sizes are often too large).  I don't think the prices are unreasonable, but it would have been nice to get a bit more with our meal (even just a small side of pasta).



This restaurant deserves a 3.5 out of 5, but since I can't give it a half-star, I'm going to round up because I like to support local business over chain restaurants.",positive

ts29,4/26/2013,revtest3020,4,"So i decided to stop here for a late night meal with a friend after a workout anout 40 min before they closed. First look in i realized i wasnt dressed properly but a server sat us anyways after giving us the are u serious look wearing jean shorts and a fight hoodie in here... lol I liked our server Danny even though we could tell he wasnt excited to be getting a table this late but he gave us a great menu rap, accent and all. I appreciated his enthousiasm even if it was a little forced. We ordered a glass of wine and a beer and they dropped off bread service for us. Bread was a bit tasteless and not exciting. 3  different types but pretty plain. When our food came out i was happy with my spagetti and meatballs, (was craving carbs after workout) good flavor and just enough sauce for me. The spagetti noodles where done perfect as well. She ordered the bolangese and enjoyed it but likes more sauce with her pasta. Daniel came to check on us and she said she was fine but he could tell she wasnt really happy so he asked her whats up and she mentioned she likes more sauce in here pastas but it was no big deal. He told her to hold on a moment and he would take care of it and moments later they sent out a small dish of piping hot sauce. No attitude or problems, just answers. That impresses us both the most. He didnt sacrifice service because of how late it was or how we were dressed. We will definetly be back just based on service and how good our entree dishes were.

ts29,6/13/2013,revtest3023,4,"In looking for a place we hadn't eaten at yet for our roomie date, my roommate and I decided to try Gaetano's since it's in our neighborhood and italian sounded yummy. Upon walking into the restaurant, I immediately felt quite out of place as it turns out this was a ""nice"" restaurant, not one in which you show up in torn jeans, a tank top and flip flops.  Also, everyone eating was about twice our age.  The maitre'd however, didn't appear to mind and graciously sat us.  



It's a very romantic atmosphere.  I liked the feel of the restaurant.  Upon inspecting the menu, we decided it was a bit more fancy than we had planned on, but we were already there and ready to eat, so we decided to just go with it.  The roomie ordered the Gorgonzola Gnocchi and I ordered the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini, which is homemade half moon pasta filled with veal, served with peas, prosciutto and porcini mushrooms in a light cream sauce.  We also ordered appetizers of fried artichoke hearts and because we checked in on Yelp, we got a free bruschetta appetizer.



The apps were just okay.  The fried artichoke hearts tasted canned and though the aoli was good, the actual artichoke was tasteless.  The bruschetta didn't taste very fresh.  After we got our apps, we waited for what seemed like forever before our entrees came out, at least 30 minutes.  When they finally did, though, I was blown away by my dish.  The mezzelune was perfectly al dente and the veal stuffing inside was bursting with flavor.  Everything on that dish played its own part in creating this phenomenal harmony of flavors and textures.  I was very very very happy with it.  The only complaint is that there were a total of 8 half-moons on my plate.  The serving was tiny for $18.95!



My roommate loved her gnocchi, but I tried a bite and thought it was just ok.  Also, the presentation of it was awful.  It looked like a bowl of white marshmellows in milk.  They could have probably used a bit of garnish to add some color.  If that had been my dish instead, this entire review would have probably received 2 stars, that's how good my Mezzelune was. 



We also ordered half a bottle of wine, which is a terrible value.  It's barely 2 glasses but it was $28.  We could have just each gotten a glass of wine for $9 and they fill it way higher.  The wine here is very expensive.



All in all, it was fun, and because my entree was SOOO incredibly delicious, i was very happy and willing to overlook the plain apps and the long wait and the big tab at the end.",positive

The first time I went was spring Restaurant Week. I have to say that I wasn't overtly impressed with the meal for the price, but I did enjoy it enough to buy the Groupon and try it again. Last night I had the fig appetizer--goat cheese, balsamic, wrapped in proscuitto ($14 for 3, noooot worth it but still good) and the butternut squash ravioli. That dish is absolutely superb. The portion size is perfect. My mom had a marsala special which was also absolutely incredible....we cleaned our plates and then some. Dessert was the tiramisu, which I didn't really have room for and didn't need, but I still enjoyed the dessert like I do.

Any how, below was our order:



-Appetizer: Brodetto $14.95

Clams and mussels, sautéed with garlic and served in a white wine and

spicy tomato broth with garlic toast



I have to admit although it was pretty skimpy on the clams and the mussels, the broth was delicious.  It had a tad spicyness to it and was creamy with a hint of basil.  Almost reminded me of a hearty tomato soup.



-Entree #1: Rolatine di Melanzane alla Siciliana $16.95

Grilled eggplant stuffed with angel hair pasta in a fresh tomato sauce,

topped with mozzarella cheese and bake



This was also good.  You get 3 pasta stuffed eggplants covered in fresh tomato sauce.  Again, the tomato sauce was yummy.  Had a tad sweetness to it kinda like spaghetti-o's...lol!  The eggplant was lightly battered (maybe pan fried, rolled then baked).



-Entree #2: Gnocchetti Sardi $19.95

Gnocchetti Pasta with olive oil, garlic, sausage and broccoli rabbi



We were disappointed with this dish.  The broccoli rabbi was over cooked resulting in a very bitter taste.  This broccoli is suppose to be slightly bitter; however having it overcooked resulted in an increase in the bitterness.

ts29,1/6/2014,revtest3044,3,"We had a $40 Groupon for the restaurant and went last Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and we were right on time.  The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.



There is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.



We were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.



We ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.



For dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla crème brulée.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The crème brulée was the winner of the two desserts.



I think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price.",negative
ts29,1/20/2014,revtest3045,5,"Over years (more than two decades now), during my visits to Vegas, I've tried to find the best Italian food.  It seemed like it was what Vegas did best.  Long before Yelp, Zagat's (when they only had books) put me onto Gaetano's, but it took me a long time to get out here.  After finally making it to Gaetano's, I haven't tried another Italian place -- and I've returned to Gaetano's on every visit to Vegas.  Every meal has been outstanding.  I've even stopped visits to Nora's (I'm going to have to change that, Nora's is excellent too, though different.  Gaetano's is more ""fine dining"".  Nora's is a bit more casual -- though the difference may not be all that big to some).



I opt for traditional entrees.  I've had fish, venison, and the best duck breast I've ever had (it's easy to overcook the the duck).  Friends like the pastas.  The butternut squash ravioli have converted me.  Recently, my entree had sweet potato ravioli that was even better.



We love to get the spaghetti and meatballs for an appetizer.  They're not on the menu, but they're always available.  Meatballs made with fillet covered in a rich sauce.  My New York friends who I had to beg to try Gaetano's (""we get great Italian at home, there's nothing youse guys can do out here as good as back in Brooklyn"") say it's some of the best they've had.



Service is impeccable.  We miss the departure of Danny who always took great care of us, but every other server is just as good.



The prices are not out of alignment with the Strip or where I live (Northern California).  I can see how those who like the Olive Garden might find Gaetano's pricy.  For those who like Olive Garden and are looking for a bargain, let me suggest Battista's Hole in the Wall down on Flamingo.  I think you'll find it much more agreeable than Gaetano's.",positive

1. Good Service 

2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home. 

3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.



After eating at Gaetano's on Monday I can say I'm getting very close. 



Service

Once we arrived we were greeted and sat at a great table in a very nice dinning room area. Our servers name was Zach. He was very knowledgable about all the food and timed his stops at our table perfectly. 



The Food

We originally selected Gaetano's because of an email that advertised veal. However, once we asked about it we were told they ran out of it days before. (This along with the fact that they didn't honor our Yelp checkin special coupon because we already had an open table discount, was the only reason they didn't receive 5 stars). After learning they were out of the veal we selected the Sea Bass and the Calamari. Once they arrived we couldn't stopped eating them. The taste of both dishes was hands down better then I could ever cook myself! So I can't wait to go back!



The Bill

We got bread, an app, 2 main dishes, desert, a bottle of wine, and a cappuccino for just over $100! The food was amazing. The service was fantastic. And the whole experience was right in line with the bill. Oh and just so everyone knows we were not forced to pay a gratuity. 



We will be back!",positive

    Started with an arugula, pear, candied pecans & goat cheese salad which was soooo good. A DEFINATE must! My husband had Broletto, which was a special and he really enjoyed it, and would chose it again if available.

     My main course was filet of sole  with butter sauce & capers (one of my all time favs) it was quite good could have been sautéed alittle more for my tastes, however the flavors were still enjoyable and the veggies served alongside were terrific not just sautéed in butter/oil but pan seared with a slight crust, just delishioso!!!!!

ts29,6/14/2014,revtest3056,3,"This is more of a 3.5 star. 



Nice decor and ambiance. Paintings on the walls, bottles of wine lining one wall, and a candle at each table. 



I made a dinner reservation and the host was pretty efficient and we were seated quickly. 



Our server was a bit slow. We waited about 7-10 minutes before anyone came to bring us menus or water. I've never really had that happen before and didn't know who our server was at the time as no one came to our table to greet us. I noticed throughout our dinner that service should be good for the most part, depending on who your server is. 



Food: 



Lamp chops- Delicious. I thought this was a nicely executed dish. Flavors were there and the lamb was done just right. I often encounter lamb overcooked so it became tough. This one was cooked properly and was still tender. 



Thin slices of veal topped with grilled eggplant- I tried a bite or two of this but personally didn't find it very memorable. It was just okay.



Linguine pasta with clams in a red sauce- Tried a few bites. Another decent dish but not overly memorable. The clams were pretty good. 



Tiramisu- Pretty good. I do love tiramisu and this one didn't disappoint. Favorite dessert of the 3. 



Creme brulee- Not bad. Not overly eggy. I wasn't blown away but I also wasn't disappointed. 



Cheesecake- Not bad either. Again, not blown away but also not disappointment. 



Overall, I think it was a nice dinner. I think our server was a bit too slow considering the place was half full. I can't imagine what it would be like if it were a full house. Service did pick up a bit when other servers came to offer bread and fill up water. It has potential to be much better.

We got the eggplant app this time, and it was so good. It's like a cheesy crunchy layered veggie lasagna with light tomato sauce. We devoured it. I couldn't decide between the mezzalune or the special italian sausage and shitake mushroom ravioli so the server offered to have the kitchen make me a half order of each. I was amazed by this generous offer!  And when I got my food, I was so happy as each dish was so delicious. I ate my entire plate.

Food: To start, we had the fig wrapped in proscuitto with goat cheese sprinkled on top ($10.99?). The flavors were on the spot - the saltiness of the proscuitto with the sweetness of the fig and the creaminess of the goat cheese. Wow. For the main course, we had the salmon and the Capellini alla Checca ($14.95) to share. It was a very good combination. Salmon was cooked well, but slightly a little too salty for my taste.



I paired my dinner with a glass of the Sangiovese, Santa Cristina (Toscana, Italy) which was $9.50. ""A medium-bodied Italian red with raspberry flavors ,a soft texture

and a light fruity finish."" I was pleasantly surprised by the wine.



I would definitely go back again. Dinner ended up costing about $75 in total, and with the $40 groupon, I only paid $44 with 18% gratuity included.",positive

We ordered the calamari & fried artichokes for our appetizers. The calamari was $13 & the portion was tiny. The fried artichokes were either canned or jarred artichokes which I could not believe. At a restaurant like that, it's completely ridiculous to use any kind of canned ingredients. My husband got the veal with mushrooms & I got one of their specials, Chilean Sea Bass. My husbands veal was nothing special & the sauce had a weird texture to it. My sea bass was good but the accompanying side of orzo with different veggies in some type of sauce was very boring & unimaginative.

I had previously looked at some reviews here and because of THAT, I ordered a small bowl of Chicken Tortilla soup ($2.99) and the before mentioned fish taco (Reg $1.99...wt coupon .99). The Total wt tax came to $4.30.



This is a few steps up from Taco Bell and the plates I saw being served looked really good & healthy. My taco was very small and not a good value at the reduced fare of .99. It was good but the Fish Taco's for .99 at Long John Silvers are way better & bigger. Now when it comes to soup, I am spoiled rotten, as I worked at a condo and the Chef there was a Pro and in fact was once Tommy Lasorda's personal Chef, and the soup this guy made was the MOST AWESOME EVER!!



The Tortilla soup was NOT as good as reviewers made it out to be. First off the portion didnt match the price of $3. I have had Campbell's Chunky Mexican Chk Soup ($1.50) that is a bigger portion for less and packs more overall flavor. It was ""OK"" at best and did have some nice chunks of chicken but not worth $3.



I'm not writing this place off by any means and will probably go back using it again as a destination on a walk one day and try the Chicken Tortilla Salad.

But I must say the drive thru at this location takes forever! Literally over 15 minutes every time I come. Even with only a few cars in front of me. I don't know what the hold up is all the time or if language barriers are an issue but El Pollo Loco needs to figure it out... At least at this location.,negative
ts30,8/2/2014,revtest3091,3,I like this place because it is tasty and they have an under 500 calorie menu that is very good. I really do hate the long wait here at lunch though.

ts30,8/8/2014,revtest3092,3,"Dining in at a fast food restaurant is not something I enjoy, but it I will do it from time to time when taking the food to go just won't do. This location is pretty busy and on the few occasions I have dined here, it gets loud and a little hard to hear your own thoughts, much less the conversation form your dining companion. 



The food is that of any other El Pollo Loco and they keep the place relatively clean with a well stocked salsa bar.",negative
ts30,8/17/2014,revtest3093,5,"I haven't had EPL in a long while - I'm so glad I decided to have lunch here. The food is always fresh tasting, the chicken is ONLY grilled to perfection - they don't fry anything but the churros, fries, crunchy tacos, or tostada bowls.

I love the salsa bar with its variety, and the cashier was amazingly friendly.

EPL has never let me down on flavor, it's consistency for service, and it's atmosphere.

I have not eaten fast food Mexican in about 20 yrs, I find quality places like this or family owned places are usually the best places to get your grind on.

The chickens always cooked right, great seasonings and they offer healthier options on the menu, more than your typical fast food joint.

ts31,11/18/2008,revtest3098,5,"Great Pub!



I'm extremely glad that my friend invited me and a few of other friends to come and visit this gem!



The decor is ""old-wester-Vegas"" as this pub has been around for quite a few years living through the ups and downs of Vegas and the growth of its West side, where this pub is located.



The food was EXTREMELY affordable--we're talking $4.00 for a full platter! It is more of a diner fare with a few upgrades. The service is extremely quick, the drink selection is vast and also affordable. Bartender was very good and waitress made us feel at home. I loved their BLT sandwish on sour dough bread, and their take on ""quasadillas"" stuffed with a plethora of meats and vegetables. Their yummy fries come in different flavors and seasonings, my favorite being ""cajun.""



This was a very good experience from start to finish. I could understand that even on a week night it was packed. Highly recommend this place!



P.S. The owner is extremely down to earth and friendly! This is a plus for anyone who is a Griz fan!",positive
ts31,11/24/2012,revtest3099,3,"Dingy and smokey, but a decent neighborhood watering hole. Typical Vegas style bar that's been around for decades.



Good pool tables and they host a few leagues there. Bartenders and bar staff are all cool and pour with a heavy hand. My friends's Makers and coke was 98% Makers with a splash of Coke for color!



A lot of regulars and friendly boisterous bunch at that. I've never eaten here but at least they have a separate dining area for the non smokers, like me, because this place is nicotine heaven.",negative
ts31,4/27/2013,revtest3100,4,"I met my good friend from Montana here. She was in town for a convention and she wanted to go to this bar....why I asked, what's special about it??? WELL, they cater to Grizzly fans!  University of Montana Grizzlies!  We met the owner who sat down and visited with us for at least 2 hours.  My friend knows him through her Uncle.  The place is older yes, smokey OH YES, but it's a bar so liquor and cigarettes go hand in hand.  The food was pretty good. I had chicken wings, my friend had a Philly cheese steak sandwich which looked delicious!!! Wishing I had chose that! Wings were good. though. Affordable food.",positive
ts31,7/1/2013,revtest3101,4,"Girlfriend and I decided to give this pub a shot.  We drove right past it the first time, as there really is no sign.  We entered the restaurant side and were the only ones there.  The bar must be great, because that side was pretty full.  Our waiter was fast and the food was great.  I will go again when we're cruising this part of town again.",positive
ts31,10/9/2013,revtest3102,3,"My perspective is from die-hard N.Y. Giants fan and all around bar fan. This bar is only one of two bars in town that cater to 'NY Giants' fans. As you read this review, keep in mind that this was an early game but this is football season in Vegas and I have been to bars for early games and they were as busy as if it were Monday Night Football.



CONS:

This place is not advertized to the general public as a NYGiants themed bar in the Las Vegas area. I found out about this place through a buddy of mine. The reason they can't advertise as being a Giants bar is because one of the criteria required by the Las Vegas Review Journal is that you cater only to the team support and not show any other game while your team is playing. But, they do, they have every game on TV and they display the Giants game on the big screen with sound. This in and of itslef is not that big of a deal because there is a decent amount of Giants fans in the place, but there are also plenty of fans of other teams too and that kind of takes away from the whole concept.



They raffle prizes at half-time but they are freebies they get from vendors and none Giants related. 



The bartender wears a Philidelphia Eagles jersey every week. 



Smoking is allowed and ventilation is definitely lacking.





PROS:

Because its definitely a locals place, the price is right. The service is always excellent. The staff is welcoming. The customers are friendly and the place is set up pretty nicely. The menu is pretty good. When I go to an early game I have the stake and eggs with hashbrowns and choice of toast for $9. It's absolutely excellent!, Well cooked and delicious. The beer always cold and on point. I'd already had breakfast so I just had the potato chip fries. These chips are very good. 



CONCLUSION:

As a bar it gets four stars but I only go during football season to watch the Giants when their not already on TV so that's all I have to go by. I gave the place three stars instead of two as a 'Giants' bar because it is as close to a Giants bar as any other bar gets in this town and beggers can't be choosers. I'd give it four stars if they were a strickly Giants bar, and five if the bartender didn't wear an Eagles jersey. If you're a football fan you understand.",negative

The service is always wonderful & the food is always good, fresh, and leaves you full and satisfied. I love the complimentary breadsticks (unlimited), they are sooo good and are always hot and fresh! They taste even better if u order some alfredo sauce to dip them in. 



My favorites: 

1. The Tour Of Italy: Delicious. Great 1st choice if you've never been there before and don't know whether u want to try the spaghetti or the alfredo.It comes with a slice of lasagna, some fettucine alfredo, and some chicken parmigiana. Very good!! 

2.Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo: Really satisfying, I ordered mine with extra chicken (it doesn't come wit very much.) 

3. Chicken And Dumpling Soup: Yum! the dumplings are sooo good! 



I never really mind waiting for my food, I usually try to dine at places like this when I want to spend time with my family, friends, or a little one on one time with my husband. As long as the food is hot and fresh, and the service is great, i have no complaints!! :]] If I wanted fast food type of italian food, I would go to a fast food type restaurant, like Fazoli's.",positive
ts32,7/28/2010,revtest3113,3,Eh... I ordered a steak dish with cheese raviolis. It is one of their limited time menu items.

ts32,8/30/2011,revtest3117,4,"Good Ole reliable Olive Garden.  You're not going to get 5 star service, you're not going to get 5 star food.  What you will get is some pretty darn good italian food at a reasonable cost, especially if you go there during their all you can eat soup and salad or the never ending pasta bowl.



The Olive Garden has become one of those places where you know the food is going to be good everytime you go.  They don't move their menu around every 6 months like alot of places do.  They offer consistency over variety.  That's not to say the food is boring, quite the opposite.  The Olive Garden has found a niche that works for them and I for one appreciate it.



On occasion they will bring some new dishes from their culinary school that might be worth a try.  They also do the same thing with their seasonal desserts.  Which reminds me, if you haven't tried the pumpkin cheesecake ye, WTF are you waiting for.  That thing is delicious!",positive

Great value for the price and as always the food didn't disappoint. Both of us branched away from our usual type of selection; Dad going with the Tuscan Grilled Chicken (grilled chicken in a sweet red wine demi glace) and me with the Bucatini pasta with meat sauce. I rarely do red sauces. The meat sauce was good; not too acidic for a red and the blend of ground beef and italian sausage pleasing and flavorful. I'm thinking, even a repeat for me. Tasted Dad's chicken and liked the glaze on it. Moist, nice char marks...good chicken. Another satisfying meal in the books.",positive

ts32,5/28/2013,revtest3123,3,"So, yah... I'm reviewing another Olive Garden. We came here not of our own volition but it was requested on a very busy day of the year, so we had quite a long wait. Considering how extremely busy they were, the wait wasn't all that bad, screaming babies in the waiting area aside. 



Once we sat down and got our server's attention he, the manager and even the busboy were all very attentive. I give the staff here props for checking up on us regularly and keeping the refills and breadsticks coming. 



The food is still eh. I would prefer soup, salad and breadsticks, but I decided on the peach chicken thing and it was just too sweet and weird. Even weirder that it was served with a pasta topped with alfredo sauce. Just a weird combination for me. 



Overall the meal was ok but the service is really what stood out to me.",negative
ts32,7/25/2013,revtest3124,3,"So overall, we had a lovely experience at this location last evening. The guest service was absolutely the most wonderful I've had in quite some time! Before your meal, they serve a basket full of breadsticks which are pretty tasty. For our appetizer, we had chose the ""create a sampler Italiano"" option in which we picked calamari, fried mozzarella, and pork ravioli. The calamari was tender, lightly breaded, and fried served with both a parmesan and marinara sauce. The fried mozzarella was absolutely delicious and the pork ravioli was pretty decent.

Before the entrée, they give you the choice between a soup or salad. I ordered a Caesar salad and my husband ordered the Zuppa Toscana which is a type of creamy potato soup served with greens. The soup was absolutely spectacular! Unfortunately, quite a few pieces of my romaine lettuce in the Caesar salad were mushy and overdressed. 

My husband ordered the Cheese Ravioli and enjoyed it. For my dish, I ordered the grilled sausage and peppers Rustica. The consistency was perfect...the penne was al dente, peppers were tender, and the Italian sausage was flavorful. However, I felt that they went slightly shy on seasoning and spices which I adjusted with table salt (and I don't really do this at a restaurant too often.)

The waiter was absolutely delightful and packed up our food for us. The portions are quite generous so you will most likely find yourself taking home leftovers. He generously also packed some wonderful mint chocolate candies. Overall, we had a nice experience.",negative

Each time i go here i usually get my chicken alfredo. Nothing special but the past couple of my experiences i get the never ending pasta bowl.



The pasta is ok, sauce is too thick in my opinion and when i bring home leftovers it doesn't age too well. after 5 to 10 hours it doesnt taste appetizing and you don't feel like eating it.

The soup and salad is tasty i enjoy it more than the pasta.



Service is good as well. We walked in for lunch on a monday and it wasn't full so we got a table quite quickly, and we didn't have to sit down.  Our waiter was fast, friendly and very informative. He told us new menu items and what he personally liked. He was very clean and very professional. Great service.



Overall though, it's just an ok experience, It's Olive Garden, Not really the best pasta, good breadsticks, professional look and great service most the time. it's just the food that isn't ""on par"" with service.",negative

ts32,4/19/2014,revtest3127,3,"I honestly just come to Olive Garden for their unlimited soup, breadsticks & salad for $6.95. I always get the Tuscan sausage soup. I've tried Tuscan soups in different restaurants & for some reason Olive Gardens always trumps everyone else's. 



Tuscan soup has a little kick to it. It's made in a thin creamy broth with ground sausage, kale, potatoes & delicious seasonings. They add grated cheese (at your preference), which makes it even better. Always gotta get their Peach Bellini as well! Bomb!



The beau got the Chicken Alfredo. Not a big fan of Alfredo but I always sneak a bite. 



They have some newer items on the menu. There's a special-- buy one now, take one to go for $12.99. Which is a pretty good deal for all the leftover Lovin fatties!



Olive Garden has one of the best Moscatos I've ever tasted. Also I tried their Roscato, which is a delicately fizzy sweet red wine. One of my new found obsessions. & I'm not a big Red wine drinker either.

Sitting at the bar can be fun, their bartenders are lively and enjoyable to talk to.



The chicken and shrimp carbonara, lasagna, and chicken flatbread never disappoints.



The chicken parmagiana is good %90 of the time, but be careful of the tough cutlets that can be churned out of here sometimes. The calamari and spicy calamari is great when you dine in, but beware of tough or fishy pieces if you order takeout at night. The same goes for the stuffed mushrooms, they're flavorful and tender on a good night.



 I'd say the chicken alfredo has a lower success rate of being as good. The alfredo sauce can be sticky and clumpy at times.",positive

It's served with garlic fries and of course choice of soup or salad, I had the minestrone soup. I definitely enjoy the pasta with tomato broth.  Hubby ordered the chicken parmesean also with garlic fries. I did have a bite of his chicken was moist and crunchy, melted provolone, marinara sauce,  the same fresh good bread as my meatball sandwich. We shared the appetizer fried lasagna,  always a good choice.

The salad I always enjoy,  to me the olives and peppercinis perfect the salad.



Something funny - for the name being Olive Garden,  the salad is the only item I seen on the menu that actually contains olives!!!  Having an olive bar would be a lovely touch.

I ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans ($6.29).  It came out shortly and I went to the Salsa Bar to get their Spicy Salsa....it has some pretty good heat and I enjoy the flavor a lot.  The Burrito was very good and satisfying.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  I discovered Rubio's about 3 years ago and for about 2 years I was there every friday for lunch.  I could walk in and they would ring up my very specific order right down to the extra chipotle on the side.  It is very nice to see great service like this place.

fish tacos!

tortilla chicken soup was pretty awesome

They have vanilla coke!

The not so good:

My chicken burrito.. I can't remember which one I ended up going with, had tons of quac in it.. I like guac, but I couldn't taste anything else in the burrito. So meh.

Wasn't really impressed with the salsa. I love spicy salsa, but I also want it to have more flavor than JUST the pepper.

I like Rubio's tacos. They are fresh and I have never had a bad experience with what I tend to order. I rotate between their original fish taco platter, street tacos platter, and grilled fish platter. I've never had the burritos, quesadillas, etc. On my last visit I had the street tacos platter (carne asada, chicken, and carnitas). They were all tasty and well prepared. Not fats or gristle, just good meat.



The chips are nice to dip in the beans and the numerous salsas you can get at the salsa bar. 



Lastly, this Rubio's is clean, the employees were very nice to me and my mother (and made sure my mother did not get any guac in her meal). Overall, Rubio's is still a fave of mine, especially this location.",positive

We ordered 3 fish tacos each, which was more than enough since they were pretty big, and a small fountain drink for only $12.26. Now that was a cheap dinner! The fish was cooked well and the cabbage was fresh. The only thing I didn't really like was the corn tortillas because they were pretty thick and broke easily, but that wasn't a big deal. i just wish there was a Rubios closer to my side of town!",positive

They were all good but the carnitas was my favorite.

First off I love fish, and fish is their speciality, so the relationship is now mutual. Getting a delicious Ono Burrito after a hard workout at the gym is a great pick me up. They have your typical steak and chicken burrito options if your not in the mood for fish, and these are also great. There is alway some new flavor on the menu to try. There food items are not swimming in grease so you wont feel like you swallowed a lead ball when your finished chowing down. If its your first time I recommend the Blackened Ono Burrito. If you want some shrimp, give the Mesquite shrimp burrito a go. This location is next to Whole foods on lake mead off the 95 exit.

I had the Mahi Mahi burrito. There was delightfully flaky mahi mahi, rice, roasted corn, red onions, guacamole all wrapped in a delight flour tortilla.

Come in on Tuesdays for half off their classic fish taco after 2:30 PM... but you may have to remind the cashier, because their registers don't automatically give the discount. Wish I'd noticed this before I paid $8.



The shrimp verde taco is also good, but I'd personally request it on corn tortillas. They're currently promoting a langostino burrito that sounds tasty, but the fish tacos are reliably large and tasty.

The omelettes are always delicious, the pumkin bread is a fixture.  The spuds are something I look forward to about going there.  Pricing is reasonable.  I haven't had anything here I didn't like.

The staff fits the decor as well.. very warm, very lovely.  The menu is full of culinary delights and fun concoctions that get your mouth watering and leave you wishing there were 20 people with you, so you could try one of everything!  Fresh ingredients, and 38 different omelets to choose from.  Each breakfast comes with your choice of toast, english muffin, pumpkin nut, or banana nut bread, or tortillas.  I opted for the banana nut bread, which was piping hot and delicious!  Choose from lobster, gulf shrimp, avocado, cherizo, among a ton of other proteins!  We ordered the Eggs Benedict Lobster, and the Lobster fest omelet.  Both were fantastic!  The benedict was rich, full of fresh, tender lobster, and cooling avocado, in a rich hollandaise, and perfectly poached eggs.  The Lobster Fest omelet was fresh, clean and light.. but a TON of it!  Very very good!  I already know what I'll be trying next!  They feature a Flatlanders Special with raw liver, parsnips, grunion lips, gardenia petals, and mint ice cream!  Probably not something I'd get everytime with a price tag of $69... but definitely a bucket list item!!  I'd also love to try ""The Bugsy"", featuring tender chunks of roast beef in an Italian red sauce.  Please make it a point to stop by next time you're in Vegas!

All of the times I have been here they would serve their homemade Pumpkin Bread before breakfast but I wasn't even offered any. I thought maybe they ran out so I just let it go until I heard another waitress next to me offer it to another table. I did one of these inner Grrrrr! sounds but it was already too late because I was getting full. My hot chocolate was never refilled even though I do get one refill for free with my order. This is my first experience here where I received less than stellar service so I will not dwell on it. I also noticed that most all of the little knick knacks were replaced with much more modern decor.

After exploring their vast menu I had the Californian.  They offer spuds or hash browns I decided on the spuds.  When the food came I noticed they did not skimp on portions.

What I really enjoy here is the basic breakfast since it's one of my favorite meals, I got the ham and eggs with toast.  Sure what I choose is a basic breakfast but I loved how it's all freshly made and the ham was cooked well and not overly salty.  I've eaten here with friends who've gotten the ""Kitchen Sink Omelet"" and various sandwiches and everyone has always left full and with boxes for the leftovers.

The restaurant is located in a strip mall of Summerlin- about 12 miles from the strip. The restaurant is family owned with beautiful pictures of the kids. This is definately not your chain restaurant. 



The service was exceptional with the waitress filling my coke about 4 times. The meal started with a huge slice of homemade pumpkin loaf that was great.



I had the kitchen sink. It was very large and fresh. It was absolutely huge with lots of cheese and very fresh. There were a few strange things like pieces of meatball. I think it had about 5 eggs and I had to bring half home.



My wife had the shrimp omelette. The shrimp was probably frozen but still very tasty. There was a ton of cheese.



We did not like the potato chips- sliced potatoes with skin on. The fries were kinda mediocre. Next time we order the hash browns.



The total bill was $25.00 which was very reasonable for excellent food and great service.



Atmosphere: Community diner with a ton of local people- lots of elderly also. Not too many kids so it was a very quiet and pleasant Sunday breakfast.

The Omelet House doesnt care about that nonsense. They are proud to be from Chicago and dont  try to hide it. All of their decor is Chicago based and I was in heaven.



Ok so how was the food? It was awesome! There was two of us and we split three dishes. The daughter had eggs Benedict and I had the loch ness. We split the waffle plate. The daughter said the Benedict was delicious and loved the waffle. 



My loch ness was pretty good but kinda gross at the same time.  I love seafood and I love eggs/breakfast dishes but have never tried to put the two together? Had to give it a try. 



The Shrimp was fresh but the shrimp flavor didnt mix well with the eggs and the avocado didnt help blend the flavors together. My suggestion for it would be to add a creamy white sauce to help blend the three contrasting flavors together.



The wait staff was top notch always willing to make a suggestion and refill your drink. Jen was our server and she was awesome and knew the dishes well enough to answer the many questions I had as well as to make suggestions bases on my questions.

We stopped in on a Saturday morning around 10am, and there was a 15 minute wait for a table.  It has a family owned business feel; everything and everybody has a purpose.  There were quite a few families with children who were all well behaved.  Service was no frills and to the point, but it was difficult to get water refills.



Bf was super happy about his omelet, the #20 Polish Omelet that was stuffed with cheddar & polish sausage.  The ham & egg plate was better than it looked.

ts35,9/20/2013,revtest3215,3,"Pretty good hidden little spot for breakfast in Summerlin.  Really, it is kinda hidden.  If I didn't see the bunch of people coming out of this little place on a Sunday morning I might have never thought to look in this corner of the strip mall!  It's located in the Smith's shopping center off of Rampart and Lake Mead.  



Seems like this Omelet House is owned by a family that is from Chicago, so the decor reflects as much.  I have no problem with that, the home of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Hot Dog (one of my fav sinful snacks) are OK with me.  It was super busy on a Sunday morning, good mix of locals and what seemed to be a bunch of church goers.  Praise be!  Hallelujah!  I got the Spirit inside me!  Sorry, sorry...too many Madea movies lately.



After a short wait we were seated by our nice hostess.  I'm thinking she may be one of the owners, her native Chicago accent was present!  A few short minutes later our waitress presented herself and brought us our drinks of water and coffee.  



The menu at The Omelet House is almost typical with lots of other breakfast joints here in Vegas.  Lots and lots of breakfast items, with a mix of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and soups.  I know this place does dinner as well, but I didn't get to go through that menu so we'll just focus on breakfast and lunch.  I really like how this Omelet House has a sprinkling of Chicago in their menu, they have some good looking stuff.  Specialties like Chicago dogs, and Italian beef sandwiches can be had for your meal.  There are a number of omelettes and breakfast specials to choose from, it can be overwhelming.



I stuck with what I like from these breakfast joints, a Club Sandwich.  Yes, a Club Sandwich.  In this case at The Omelet House, a California Club.  Comes with turkey, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on white or wheat bread.  Also a side of potato spuds (think chips), fries, soup or salad.  I don't know what it is about a Club Sandwich that I like so much.  Might be the nostalgia of when we used to go to restaurants as a kid my Mom would always order a Club Sandwich and share some with me.  Might be that 3rd layer of bread that made a Club Sandwich seem so darn special.



Anyway, the Club Sandwich at The Omelet House was good.  A nice sized portion, big looking sandwich.  The bread was nice and toasted, the veggies were fresh, and the fries were tasty.  Not the best Club Sandwich I've ever had because this one needed more mayo (lots please), and some bacon!  This sandwich would have been off-the-cuff with some crispy bacon!  It was just missing a punch of salt.



The wifey had a corned beef omelet with potato spuds.  Large omelet!  Very tasty too.  The salty corned beef went great with the delicate eggs.  Add some Tabasco and it was some good eats.  But I have had better omelettes elsewhere.  Breakfasts also come with your choice of toast, english muffin, pumpkin nut bread, banana nut bread, or tortillas.  We got the banana nut bread and it was yummy.  Not too dry, lots of bananas!  



It's a tad pricy to eat at The Omelet House I'm guessing because it is Summerlin after all.  Much of the menu ranges from the $7 - $10 area for entree type dishes.  So if you're a cheapy look at the menu accordingly.  Service is fast since you will probably be eating with a million other people.  But they are nice for the most part.  Probably be back here again for a meal, just wouldn't be my top choice.",negative

ts35,2/4/2014,revtest3222,3,"I was surprised about how busy this place is, given it was breakfast and on a Sunday, however, it just never looked that busy to me from the outside. We went on around 10 am - the wait was 20 minutes for two people. However, there were two open seats at the counter with no waiting so we sat there. They told me that it was always that busy on weekend mornings. 



I had the St. Paddy's Day Omelet. Per the waitress the omelets were the best thing to get, made with six eggs. It was a little under $11. It was huge and could feed two people. The St. Paddy's Day omelet contained corned beef hash and cheddar cheese.  The omelet itself wasn't that impressive, other than the size, it tasted okay but a true omelet should be fluffy and a little soft in the center. This had more than consistency of a frittata, eggs were overcooked and was more dense than fluffy. 



The I picked the spuds that went with it. I think that they cut potatoes on a mandolin and fried them.  There was no vegetables, such as onion and green pepper like you may expect in a country potato, the slices were inconsistent as to thickness which in turn made them inconsistent as to how they were cooked. Some were really crispy like a potato chip and other thicker slices were undercooked and greasy in the center. 



Also, the entree came with banana bread, this was tasty, not sure if it was homemade or a box mix though. Some place you can easily tell box mix but either I was really hungry or my palette was off that I just wasn't sure.  



There is a 2 for 1 coupon in the entertainment book up to $7.00 off. So for two people with two omelets our total was around $18.00, I also had coffee which was $2.50. 



I debated between the two and three stars, the food was ""meh"" but the portion size was good and the waitress was very accommodating and nice. Also, she was relatively attentive considering how busy they were and it appeared that they were understaffed. Also, as a side note it took forever to get our food - they warned us they were back up after we ordered.",negative

I'm surprised more people don't know about this place. the dining room is large. We went on a Sunday morning about 9:30 and it was half empty but there were plenty of people both coming and going, so they were busy.

Open 24/7, all donuts fresh fried and glazed. 



I walked in and looked at the display rack of fresh donuts, literally saw them glistening with their generous freshly just glazed icing. 



$7.99 for a dozen, well 14 donuts to be exact, not sure if that is standard or just because I walked in with two nice big plump donuts of my own? Anyhow that is a steal for fresh, moist, melt in your mouth donuts at 2am. 



Service is great, I mean really I don't expect mind blowing service from a donut shop, much less at 2am. Also does not take much skill or thrill to fill a box with donuts. 



The gentleman working this particular early morning shift had lots of spunk and vigor. He is one with tons of personality, joking and told me my total was 7 million dollars, you know those funny types. Really refreshing considering he works graveyard!

A few caveats though - 

1) They tend to run out. They will reserve pretzels for you if you call in advance, though.

2) They close way too early. They should be open till at least 7pm - preferably midnight. I can't imagine the post-bar business they could do on Carson St. As it is, you'd better not get a pretzel craving after 3pm or you'll be out of luck.

3) They don't sell chips. If you're the type of person who thinks that sandwiches and chips are made for each other, take the time to stock up on chips elsewhere.

Being located in the South Side I kind of feel that it gets masked by the 100's of bars which in a way makes it all the more better. It's one of those places that gets better each time you go. It's pretty small so it's easy to miss it but once you walk through those doors it's like your hit pretzel wonderland.



My personal favorite is the ham and cheese pretzel sandwich. A pretzel sandwich with real ham, not lunch meat ham, I'm talking Easter Sunday ham. I also love that they heat it up for you. If you're a turkey fan, they have those too. In addition to that they've got your traditional pretzel as well as many other flavors. You really have you pick of many delicious pretzel treats.

Then on a chilly but clear Friday I was finally able to make a lunch dash! I grabbed two of the smaller bacon parm pretzels and luckily had some cash on me, as it's a cash only place. 



While on the salty side, they were DELICIOUS. They weren't warm but it was nothing a quick trip to a warm oven or the microwave wouldn't cure.

I'm a pretzel junkie, and these delightful little nibbles from the pretzel Gods totally hit the spot. They reminded me of the mall pretzels I used to get; I think the name of the place was ""Hot Pretzel"" (real original, right?) only a little softer and a bit more yeast-y.

Oh yeah, they have pretzels too - flavored ones if you like. How about jalapeno, Cajun, garlic, or parmesan bacon? Spectacular!! But here's a tip, the BEST thing in here is NOT the pretzel.

My major beef with this place is their breakfast pretzel. It's like a salty sweet soft pretzel that is meant for breakfast. I think they are kind of gross. They seem to use regular table salt and sugar and the salt over powers the sugar and just tastes like a really salty soft pretzel. Which in my mind is not good for breakfast at all. 



When people at work get them and if I'm really hungry I have to say to myself before taking a bite ""salt...it's going to be salty"" and then take a bit. Else it takes me by surprise every time.

The sandwich was also quite messy to eat, since some of the cheese and dressing had leaked out of it, despite its being wrapped up, and continued to leak as I was eating it.  Usually, two napkins is sufficient for me, but this is one of the few times I wish I'd picked up more of them.



In addition to my sandwich, I picked up a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, which, though small, was tasty and full of chocolate chips.  Together, the sandwich and cookie cost a whopping $4.40 (take that, Subway!).  Service was friendly and efficient.

The Pretzel Shop is another Pittsburgh Institution. Made on the premises in large quantities, you can also buy a ton for very little. It makes places like Auntie Anne's look like amateurs. The pretzels taste great, and taste even better when you take home a full bag of 'em to eat later.

They're both tasty faves and I never had one of either that I felt was not up to scratch. The various cookies and other pastries they sell here are also quite good.

I have to admit, the first time I tried this place, I didn't like it.  The huge portions and low price was great, but the food was mediocre. But that's because I ordered from the americanized menu.

It's definitely better than Phong May House (see my review if you want to compare). I think my initial reservations about going here revolved around what it looked like from the outside, and to some degree what it looks like on the inside as well. It's in the Crafton Ingram Shopping Center and it looks like a dive. But it's a great dive. There are tables for dine-in eating, but I'd say more than 90% of Chan An's business is take out. They don't do delivery.



But that's no big deal, as the food is always ready in about ten minutes, unless they're really busy, in which case it'll be twenty. So what's good here? 



Well, for starters, I love the wonton soup. Chan An uses a dark broth that is actually packed with flavor, unlike all the other Chinese eateries in the area which stick to a chicken-based broth, which is always flavorless for the most part. I don't get how that happens. Someone please explain it to me. The lack of flavor, not the base, that is.



I'm a fan of the sweet and sour pork here, as well as the cashew chicken. I've noticed Chan An likes to use lightly battered dark meat pieces of chicken with a darker sauce when it comes to some of their dishes such as the cashew chicken. It can sometimes be a little salty, but most days it's right on the money. Plus they also throw in water chestnuts, which I love and wish more Chinese restaurants would do. 



The egg rolls are really good. Not greasy, not overdone, but just right. The fried wontons are good and the beef on the stick is amazing. It's not your usual beef on a stick. Well, it is, but then they wind up deep frying the beef before skewering it, and I've never had it like that, but it's really tasty. It bring out the sweetness of the beef really well.



The people who run the place are super friendly and they'll do their best to accommodate your tastes if you want something made a little differently. The prices are good and in line with other affordable Chinese restaurants. So don't let the look of the place fool you. Chan An does a lot of business and I'd say that's mostly down to the quality of their food. Convenience is nice, too, but that doesn't always make for tasty eats.

Prices are ok.  You will be just under $10 for a combo with fried rice, egg roll, and drink. 



The General Tsos here is actually a little different than most.  The sauce is not as red and sweet as some. It's more brown and spicy.  It was different than expected but good. 



The service was very good.  The lady that took my order was polite and attentive.  After arriving I decided to eat in just to save time and she immediately brought my drink and egg roll over to my table. It was crisp and not greasy.  But good. 



The rest was served in the tiny silver takeout tray.  At first I was surprised, but when I realized I wasn't going to finish my meal, it made sense to serve it this way. When she noticed I wasn't eating anymore she brought over a lid and a bag to take home.

UPDATE: 12/22/2014



I'm upping my review of Chan An's to five stars (from four). It's become my regular go-to stop for quick and tasty Chinese food. The whole place is like one big happy family between the employees and the clientele. Everyone who goes is pretty much a regular.



A couple nights ago, I went and after I came in and placed my order, a small army arrived behind me. It got rather crowded quickly with everyone standing around waiting to get their takeout. At one point, the cashier was trying to tell one of the customers where the various sauce packets were and saw that there was one packet of soy sauce left in the bin. I offered to help him restock, and he directed me to where they kept all the packets. I was soon refilling the bins as fast as I could. It was amusing. It's that kind of place.



I returned again last night and te same guy and I talked a bit while I was waiting for my order. He had gone to the Strip District earlier in the day and bought some cheese. So we started discussing our mutual love for cheese, and I directed him to Wheel and Wedge and their great cheeses. He sliced off a piece of his Strip District cheese and handed it to me to share. It was tasty. I know this has nothing to do with Chan An's food, but it's this sort of laidback and enjoyable experience that keeps me coming back as much as the vittles.",positive

It's pretty easy to find, but you have to be paying attention.  You actually have to go past it and take a gravel access road back to it.  It's more of a dive bar & grill than a drive in.  It's small with a bar, about 6 or so booths and pool table & some video games.  The regulars gave me a once over, but the proprietor was friendly and the service was great.  They make their burgers from fresh hamburger.  Sit at the bar and you can watch yours being made.  I opted for a cheeseburger all the way with chili.  All the way includes cole slaw, onion, mustard, and probably some other things which I'm forgetting.  The burger was juicy and tasty.  The fries are frozen, but they were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside which is exactly how I like them.  My burger, large fries, and two beers came to $13, you can't beat that.

The chili and slaw is made in house, he had a bbq sandwich special the day, I was with one of my friends so we ordered a bbq sandwich, hot dog and a hamburger, I wanted to try EVERYTHING!!!  I ordered a jalapeno burger, he put pickled jalapenos on the grill before he placed them on the burger!  I watched him make all the food, he makes every sandwich with care.



The hot dog won my vote, it was piping hot and I asked him to cook it well done, it was perfect.  My French fry barometer registered a sexy whistle because I thought I was at the strip club.  The French fries were so hot, you had to let them cool, even dipping them in ketchup didn't work.. hot, hot, hot!

This place has been here, owned by Phil Hinson and family for over 50 or 60 years.  I think the reason it is called a ""drive in"" is because before his frontage was taken to widen Independence Boulevard, people exited the highway and parked out front.

In this case, however, maybe not so much.



First, finding your way into Hinson's isn't easy. It's not difficult, but it's not as simple as it could be. Then, as with the infamous Asian Corner Mall, you may need to check your alignment afterwards.



Second, the hours are not exactly regular, and the signage doesn't help. Typically you see a building with lit neon and you think ""open"". Not always the case here. They are supposedly open at 11am most days (they are not open Monday). At least one day, however, we came by and they weren't open when they ""should have been"". No explanation - just no one there. It wasn't even the typical July 4 week that some small companies take off. Just nobody around.



If you do happen to get by when they are there, the inside isn't much to look at (there is an inside, in comparison to say Brooks). Staff is friendly, if not overly welcoming. Food is decent, but not exceptional.



Now what makes them a ""drive in""? Nothing, really. Apparently they used to be a drive-in (think South 21 on Independence near Uptown), but since Independence/Highway 74 grew, they don't do that these days. Frankly, this cinder block building doesn't look much like it could have ever supported a drive-in. But that's neither here nor there, just a tidbit of information I found interesting.",negative

I was debating on the Fire Burger and the pulled pork sandwich. I ordered the Fire Burger {double} medium rare and was cooked to perfection and one of the better greasy spoon burgers i've had in a long time. I like that all the burgers are not frozen and fresh made to order. We also had the tater tots, Onion rings and Corn nuggets. Wife said the tater tots were good and i loved the onion rings.

PS. To get into this place is a bit confusing just ask my wife, But you drive down about 2 blocks past hinson's and turn right before the shell gas station. If you are at the shell station you have gone to far. Also once you take the right you go down prolly 200 feet and take immediate right and go down what you would call a frontage road i guess and park out back.

Perfect for cool summer nights and really any season in Charlotte except for when its raining.  Decent beer selection, but nothing spectacular...like I said its the atmosphere of Thomas Street that makes it so cool, everyone is just there to chill, drink, meet up and have a good time.  The stadium seating near the ping-pong table adds to the unique attitude of this bar and when the competition heats up you can feel it throughput the lower part of the outdoor bar.  When the temperatures dip south they have fire pits in some of the outdoor tables as well as the traditional stand alone outdoor heaters. So come outside, drink a beer and gaze at the stars, and feel the vibe of Thomas Street; my favorite bar in Charlotte, it's unpretentious and straight -up chill so come kick it, if it isn't already ridiculously crowded...if it is... head up the street to P-Stone.",positive

My friends and I all ordered Blue Moon beer. The newly pregnant one ordered a Shirley Temple and got a hint of an eye roll from the server. Even so, we loved our server - he was attentive and friendly, checking back often to see if we were doing alright. 



It was cold that night, so I couldn't talk the group into going outside to enjoy the fire on the patio. However, if and when I go back, I will certainly check it out. I love the stadium seating out there. 



 think the layout of this place was the most impressive to me. They have a front patio where dogs can hang out too, then you walk into a long bar where I'm sure the regulars sit, then a seating area on the ground level leads to the back where more tables are available on a raised platform.

Fried pickles at the Penguin and then beers and ping pong at Thomas Street?  No, didn't think so.



Relatively cheap prices on their beers and a big selection is one of the main reasons we keep coming back here.  The last couple times they've been out of this beer or that, have to wonder if they have problems keeping their bar stocked or if they just have that much of a crowd. 



Wait staff has always been good and friendly; quick with the beers or a recommendation.

Thomas Street Tavern reminds me of gringo bars in Mexico that are a little bit out of the way but if you ask the right people or poke around enough, you'll inevitably wind up here.  Slightly eclectic crowd, cabin fever locals, musicians who are off the clock, road worn travelers.  And everyone there just wants to get away from the fray, not too loud, be casual, mingle and leave everything else behind...

There is a cute little cabanaesque bar outside on the patio, I would recommend going outside because it is much less congested.  Not only that, the guys who hang out around the pool table are kind of pushy and not really people friendly.  I did get a chance to meet the owner towards the nights end and he was very approachable, and seemed to care about his guests.

I don't like the crowd, and the service gets pretty (understandably) sloppy when it's busy. The whole scene reminds me of college a little too much...screaming folks enamored with their own drunkenness...If you're in the mood for college antics, it's a great place to go.



On the other hand, I've had great experiences at Thomas Street during the afternoons. It's good for lunches with friends, especially in the summer with the patio. On evenings when it's not too crowded, the drama at the ping pong table can be pretty intense. (Has anyone else noticed that Charlotte has a weirdly elaborate ping pong culture?)

The large back patio allows you to relax and enjoy the warm weather (or the glow of the heat lamps in the winter). But other nights, it's packed with a snobby crowd that resembles a frat party. Basically, Thomas Street has gotten too popular for its own good. 



When I go in, I head straight for the back patio, where there is a separate bar and the smoke isn't quite so thick. The food is OK for bar food, but it typically takes a long time before it arrives. Still, the Ping-Pong is free, and the drinks are cheap.",negative
ts41,10/2/2008,revtest3363,4,"if there was a fool-proof way to keep all the god foresaken yuppies out of this place i might go there every night.  since that doesnt seem to be an option i stick to wednesday/thursday nights.  if you are a drunk like me and the slapasses i associate with then you will enjoy drinking there during the day on saturdays as well.  decent bar food, cheap whisk, ping pong, epic patio = good enough for me.

ts41,11/6/2008,revtest3364,3,"At last, I found what I was NOT missing in life... cigarette smoke-laced food at a pub.  (They allow smoking at bars still in Charlotte?)  Thomas Street Tavern offers  your standard pub-grade food: it will fill your tummy, stall or soak up the alcohol and get the job done.  



What I enjoy about Thomas Street is that it's unpretentious: what you see is what you get.  Pool table, back patio, plenty of seating, decently priced beers and adequate service.  TVs that are just perfect for moving your eyes towards when your conversation lulls or when that hot guy you've been checking out catches you staring at him (just pretend you're looking past him, right? Hehe.)

ts41,2/18/2009,revtest3366,3,"Great back patio, despite the rather angry staff.  Apparently it was a bad night for staff at the TST.  It was chilly outside, so there were a couple of tiki torches lit.  We stepped off the porch and down to the patio by the ping pong tables, and there was an unlit torch, so I decided to go light it from the one on the patio myself.  As I was about to light it, someone grabbed the stand, and I wheeled around to see one of the staff with an angry face ask me ""What are you doing? The fire marshal told us yesterday that we couldn't have these, and now you're dripping oil all over the patio.""  Now I understand that this guy probably has to deal with lots of drunken crazies with pyro fetishes (after all there's a table at the outside bar that has a fire pit in it), and he needs to be firm to get his point across, but I did not at all appreciate that tone when there were clearly other tiki torches lit around the porch, and there was not a drop of oil on the ground under the torch that I was holding.  Ok, whatever, ""I'm so sorry, I'll just sit down"".  Three minutes pass, and the same guy walks out to light the said tiki torch.  He then pats my arm and says ""There you go, honey, your torch is now lit.""  Please don't touch me, particularly if you don't know me, and you were just reprimanding me with angry eyes.  I know you're trying to make nice, but the touching only makes it creepy.  5 minutes later, a different guy on the patio who was smoking and talking on his cell phone closes his phone forcefully while uttering a choice expletive and walks up to the tiki torch, blowing it out with wet, smoky breath.  He then proceeds to walk up to the porch and blow them all out, and recruit the original employee from my story, and they carry all the now blown-out tiki torches back to the shed where no one can mess with them.  Guess the fire marshal did call.



Whatever, I understand, just wish they'd had their story straight.  So now I'm watching ping pong, and helping retrieve the balls that fall under the net (why bother to have a net if it doesn't go all the way to the ground to catch the balls), and all of a sudden the first employee comes running out with angry eyes to yell at the girl who put her bottle on the table.  Again understandable, but she was not being drunk or belligerent, and it was the first time, for like 2 seconds.  Clearly this guy has had to deal with one too many people and just doesn't care about being hospitable any more.



All that said, I did like this place.  There could have been more heaters out back, but the ping pong, cornhole, and fire pit by bar were awesome.  I would go back.  As long as I wear heavier clothes for the cold weather, and make sure to be on my best behavior.",negative

ts41,7/15/2010,revtest3371,4,"Good food, good brews, good crowd....and a patio with ping pong.



The Thomas St. Taven is a staple of the Plaza Midwood bar scene.  In fact, if you don't prefer a certain scene for a bar (i.e. hipster, dive bar, biker bar, etc), you'd like this place.  The clientele is mixed; black white, straight, gay, college age and cougar alike find a home here.  



They have Stella Artois on tap and a couple of atypical beers on special.  The patio is awesome, even in the winter when they pull out heaters.  The tavern gets kinda packed in the summer months...so if you don't mind the crowd, you're in for a treat.",positive

They also have pool tables inside.  I didn't check out the food menu, but the front patio was packed with diners.  Beer selection was moderate, with quite a few options on tap.

ts41,9/24/2010,revtest3373,5,"I felt compelled to write a review of Thomas Street given the unfortunate press that has surrounded it lately.  I've been going to Thomas Street for about 2 years now and it has one of the most ecclectic and diverse crowds I've seen in Charlotte.  During the week, you will find a less crowded more chill scene, and on the weekend it is usually packed after 10:30 (but not in a way that makes it annoying).  The outside patio has cornhole, and ping pong tables -  inside there is pool and foozball.  



The bartenders are very down to earth.  The drink prices are the best I've seen in Charlotte, and they are poured generously.  



This is NOT a club scene, top 40 kind of place.  You will find a juke box with mostly alternative and classics.  Come dressed down, and be prepared to get comfortable and have a great time.  Oh, and if you are leaving the bar solo at night, a bartender or bouncer is always happy to walk you to your car (in fact, they insist!).



There really isn't a bad thing I could say about Thomas Street.  It gets 5 stars because they also allow dogs on the patio :)

You can spend time here on their patio out back, where dogs are welcome, enjoying warm weather and dining al fresca or even at night in chillier temps they have neato fire pits at several tables.

There have been plenty of times where friends were running late for dinner so we would pop into the tavern for a quick drink before dinner.



Never actually eaten here, but I suspect the usual pub-ish food.  Bartenders are pretty nice and the place isn't so crazy that they actually have time to talk to you.  I haven't become ""a regular"" yet, but I can see this place having a lot of those types of clients.



I've been in their outdoor area maybe once or twice and it is filled with activities.  In all honesty, I pretty much stick to home base - the bar... and I am pretty content there.",positive

That being said it's a great bar with a cool vibe and ping pong tables out back.  That's right PING PONG!! I'm a sucker for a good game of table tennis :)  I actually prefer the space outside because of the room and space it affords you so I can't wait till the weather breaks and temperatures drop so I can really enjoy it.



Back to the food.  I have a couple favorites, one being the Chicken Tweety (I think it's called Jessica's Tweety now).  Grilled chicken breast with lettuce and tomato on a toasted hoagie roll with garlic salt butter atop the bread that really makes the sandwich great.  My other favorite is the Johnny Dollar Beach Burger.  Huge burger topped with whatever you like and sure to fill you up, no worries!  They also have an option to build your own sandwich which is great if you are looking to make a veggie sandwich with lots of fresh ingredients.



The decor is full of warm wood and brick accents, I think it actually use to be an old post office? Great location out front with a simple patio space that equates to a good people watching location (my favorite spectator sport).",positive

T he game we were looking for wasn't on but he was nice enough to put it on one of the many TVs.   I ordered the california club which was delicious!  And had a few irresistible $2 PBRs. But the winning quality for me was that they keep the juke box going even when the games are on, which I love, but it could have been pumped up a decibel or few.



They have chalkboard walls in the restrooms but  BYOC (bring your own chalk)  jukebox and pool table near the front.  Awesome back patio with baggo boards, table tennis, and wall hooky.  As well as a fire pit, TVs, two bars and plenty of seating.



fyi - order wings or ribs on sunday and get entered to win a trip to vegas.  We won the package trip and it's not without a catch.... the airfare is 2 for 1 at regular price and the hotel package is sunday - thursday, the $500 in vegas chips is a coupon book to vegas.... so, while it's still super cool to win anything especially an excuse to go to vegas, it's not exactly a free trip to vegas.",positive

From the ping pong tables where my friend said he could totally pwn all the people there to the corn hole and various other games it was all super chill.



The drinks here can get a bit expensive though. My friend had 2 margaritas and the tab came out to $25!! What?! I am kind of used to $6-10 margaritas. I went with the eternally girly Malibu bay breeze and it was fairly decent on pricing.



This place is a cool place for chilling with your bros and girlfriends but I think I'd recommend pregaming at home or Common Market down the street before heading here and hitting up the games and keeping your drink orders to a minimum.",positive

I've only eaten here a couple times at lunch and the food is pretty good but I personally enjoy just hanging here for drinks. There are also other bars within walking distance so it's a great place to start a fun weekend night or get some sun on a Sunday Funday!



Special tip: There are 3 restrooms inside the restaurant and 2 of them are typically designated for the ladies so the lines are always really quick for females, which is awesome! Also, the potty rooms have huge chalkboards on the wall so patrons have fun doodling notes to their friends and other random peeps who use the facilities. Totally random but FUN!

Huge outdoor patio with Cornhole and Ping-Pong tables (if you can ever get to them) and an outdoor bar to keep your mind at ease. It does get crowded pretty much any day the weather is nice. And for some reason a random mosh pit/ dance party mix up has developed every time I have visited the patio... Not a complaint, just an observation. Cathy has always been at the patio bar when I have visited and always does a killer job. Food is standard bar fair. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but def a good place to drink and relax... or dance if you feel so inclined. Only downside are the bathrooms.

The atmosphere here is amazing. You have a bar inside with tv's, a foosball table, and a pool table.  During the week it begins to feel like cheers where the bartenders remember your name and your drink.  The bartenders actually are pretty cool down to earth people here. The outside section is where this bar shines.  There is plenty of seating with fire pits and another bar outside. They have a net enclosed ping pong area which is always fun trashed, cornhole, and the akward game where you have to get the ring on the hook. This mix of people here is great.  From locals, to hipsters, to college kids, and anyone else in between.  



For me if you don't want to go to a club Thomas Street is always an amazing place to go.  There is so much fun things to do outside and the people watching is great.  The bar prices are not expensive at all and there are many other bars to hop to close by.  The food here is acceptable, but I would probably eat somewhere else if I could.

I met a few friends here for food and drinks on a weekday night recently.  The food was good, not great - standard bar fare.  I recommend the onion rings.  



The ambiance on this weeknight was a bit dull and drab as I stated.  Its not that anything was WRONG, there was just something missing.  I soon remembered that every previous time I'd been to Thomas Street was during the spring or summer time.  I feel like the cold, weather def has a negative affect on TST.  This is probably because so much about this bar is predicated on its extensive outdoor patio set-up.

They have a decent beer selection and daily specials, and the food is pretty good, too. They do sandwiches, burgers, wings, and appetizers. Everything is fresh (food and beer), and service is consistent.

I'll hold a paddle and slam backhands all night long, regardless of where it is, with a grin from ear to ear. Heck, if there were a pingpong table at my wife's nail salon I'd go every time. 



Thomas Street is a great dive-y bar to meet up with some friends for some sub-par grub and plenty of foamy brews. I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed a good greaser or hoagie. Hey Oh, heartburn! It's always worth it, though, isn't it? 



Best part about this joint is the back patio. Not much to shake a stick at in the winter time or if the sun isn't shining on a Saturday afternoon, but when it's right, this place is the crown jewel of hangouts on Thomas Ave. Cornhole, plenty of bench seats, tables, draughts outside, and many a lively 20-something enjoying it all the same. Again, ping pong tables? Count me in. Note: it can be rather difficult to nudge your way in line to grab a game. Kindly ask bro-ho du jour for next game and you should be good.

ts41,2/21/2014,revtest3407,4,"Thomas Street Tavern has become my go-to Plaza Midwood bar -- great patio space, cheap drinks, outdoor games, interesting clientele, and solid bar food.  I didn't know they served food until last night, but man, what a pleasant surprise!  I was expecting the worst because---let's call a spade a spade---Thomas Street is a dive.



The menu is as random as the clientele, but mostly consists of sandwiches.  I had the chili nachos, cheese fries, and BLT with fries (take your judgment elsewhere, it was my cheat meal).  It was all really delicious in the greasy bar food kind of way.  And it was all really cheap.  That being said, the service was kind of shitty.  There was one waitress for the entire patio and she was just so over it... or possibly on drugs.



Like I said before, the clientele is interesting, which is both a good and bad thing.  Sometimes interesting means funny and cool; sometimes interesting means super hillbilly and creepy.  I find that you can generally avoid the latter type of interesting by staying in the patio/fire pit area, as they tend to congregate around the pool tables and outside bar.



Also great for nights when you just don't feel like wearing big girl/boy pants.  Nobody here will think less of you for wearing sweatpants and flip flops.",positive

They have ping pong and corn hole as well as fire pits patio seating and a bar out back. Tons of TVs an they keep this back area pretty heated in the colder months  



Overall this is a really cool bar. Locals are often found here as it is situation just outside of downtown. The area has tons of restaurants but Thomas street offers a full menu as well.  a must go if you live in Charlotte.",positive
ts41,3/16/2014,revtest3409,5,"Oh Thomas street. How I love thee. My favorite bar, and for one reason and one reason only. The staff. They make regulars and strangers feel comfortable. Its my version of ""cheers."" Everybody knows your name. Pretty much my second home.",positive
ts41,5/2/2014,revtest3410,5,"I have been going here for a solid 10 years. That makes me feel old. It also makes me feel like I am finally a real Charlottean to be able to say that. 



The Good:

This is a true neighborhood bar. This isn't hipster. It will never be hipster. Thomas St is simply T St. It never changes much- even with the neighborhood changing. You can easily go there and see people from all different walks of life, ethnicity, age and income. 



The outdoor area really is the best in Charlotte. I dare you to find one that is more comfortable, welcoming, not pretentious and with a lot of plants (seriously Charlotte- so many outdoor areas here are not landscaped).  There are games galore and plenty of seating. Lots of heaters and fire pits. 



This is one of the best spots in the city to watch TV outside. One of my favorite days was watching a game outside under the patio while there was a storm. 

The Nachos can be really good (not always), the chicken fingers are highly recommended (especially the honey mustard), the king veggie burrito is a favorite with the vegetarians and the commonwealth roast beef is for the meat eaters.



You can bring your dog!!! (do not walk him through the restaurant- there is usually a gate open in the back. Ask someone to open it if it isn't)



They still have the same crappy Christmas decorations, there are always people willing to play pool (it is very communal- you don't own the table with your BFF- at Thomas St you share), the TV's are usually on mute because this isn't really sports bar. It is more like a neighborhood hang out.





The Bad:

T St is not consistent. You might go there and have really good food. The next time you go- meh. 



This used to be a fun place on a Saturday night. Now it is a during the week type of a place or during the day. The Friday and Saturday night crowd is really annoying. Think: part busses from University. It turns into a really awkward meat market. Avoid late night on weekend.



The service can be bad. We accept this about T St. In fact, I'm sort of happy that it hasn't changed. Don't get me wrong- there are some really good servers who have been there for years. But there is also a ""I don't care"" attitude that happens. Don't take it personally. It is part of Thomas Street's charm and irritation. 



I personally love this place, but it isn't for everyone, nor should it be.",positive
ts41,5/4/2014,revtest3411,5,"One of my absolute favorite bars/hangout spots of all time.  Love going to Thomas Street for the awesome atmosphere, good (cheap drinks) and the spacious entertaining back area.

Definitely one of the more upscale places in plaza midwood.",positive

ts41,7/21/2014,revtest3415,4,"This place was one of the most interesting bars I've been to! Went here on a Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon to provide you with an honest opinion... This place is hard to find.. If you are not a local or don't know one, you probably wouldn't know about this place since it is out of the tourist area.



Food experience wise.. Saturday evening gets crowded and busy with a small selection of craft beer.  Ordered some chicken tenders tossed in buffalo with a side order of cheese tots!  The chicken tenders were definitely something I was looking for.. They give you a generous portion and do not over bread the chicken before they fry it.  The chicken was tender with every bite.  The cheese totz were good on Saturday night because they were crispy with enough sharp cheddar cheese.  Sunday afternoon the chicken tenders were just as satisfying as Saturday but the cheese totz were soggy and soft.. There was no crunch to it.. And the serving experience on Sunday was terrible.. I had to go find my waitress to order and find her to pay for my bill... Saturday night this gentleman provided my party and I with amazing service and was prompt.



OK... Now what makes this bar so different.. In the back patio there are two tables of ping pong for guests to play, two ""sink and hook"" games, and 2 sets of corn hole games! Saturday night gets really busy so its hard to play corn hole or ping pong and on Sunday there was only one corn hole game out since there wasn't a high amount of requests for it.



Overall, very chill and relaxing bar. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to drink and play games with friends...",positive
ts41,9/7/2014,revtest3416,4,"I went to the Tavern on a Friday night. They had a cover charge of $5 because of the band that was playing. There was a mixed crowd which is always a good thing. Everyone seemed friendly. The band was amazing! My friend and I had such a great time dancing. I had a couple beers, 4 shots of tequila, and an appetizer for about 36 bucks.  Our waiter was so hot and friendly. In the back, We had a couple good convos with our fellow smokers. Heard the have reggae night on Thursdays I will definitely be checking that out! The only thing that needed attention was the bathroom situation.",positive

ts41,10/14/2014,revtest3418,4,"I love this place. It's my go-to watering hole. I think ever major life decision was made in the back of Thomas Street Tavern while sitting around one of the fire pits. Such a local feel, with neighborhood kids of all ages (drinking age of course) and their dogs! Everyone is super friendly and there is normally a corn hole or ping pong game to jump in on. And that fun game with the sting and hook - what is that game??? I don't know but its hours of fun and conveniently located next to one of Thomas Streets two bars in the back area. 



You gotta love a bar that takes their live music seriously too - its always good. Its also a pretty rad lace for Sunday football. There aren't enough TVs to watch every game at once outside from one seat but I can't lie to you ... its kind of nice. It causes more banter and chat with soon to be close friends and lets be real - this whole NFL ticket thing is great but slow down! Remember our parents didn't have this luxury. Plus that ESPN app is pretty killer. BUT if you must see all 5 to 7 games from your seat go inside. That big ass screen and all the TVs lining the walls will suit your fancy just fine.",positive

There is absolutely nothing to dislike about this place. Walk in and you get that old bar feel, with friendly bartenders to greet you on the right and a pool table on your left. Be sure to order an extremely affordable beer ($4.50 draught everyday!) for yourself. The taps rotate, but yesterday included the Triple-C IPA, Highland Gaelic Ale, Guiness Stout, Noda Midnight Madness, and more. 



After you choose a delicious craft brew, keep walking out back and you'll find another bar entirely, TWO Ping Pong tables, and a Cornhole set ready to rock. I spent the better part of last night holding down a table, which is exactly the confidence boost a struggling doctorate student needs every once in a while. 



All in all, terrific bar and I find myself coming back at least once whenever I visit home. I've never tried the food, though it always smells like fried heaven. Stay exactly the same, Thomas St Tavern!",positive

Fantastic, thin-crust pizza at very affordable prices. 9"" pies (which are truthfully more like 11"") start at $7.50 for plain cheese with additional toppings at half a buck each. Salads are cheap-ish and the house dressing (a unique creamy Italian) is subtle and satisfying. I've always had awesome service here as well-- and the pizza dude (owner?) slinging dough as you enter is a sweetheart.



There's also some interesting wines on their short list, ranging up to $60 a bottle.",positive

 A pasta dish runs about $11 and is a sizable portion.  The bruchetta was good, the tomatoes were a little boring (not enough garlic or spices) but the bread was perfect, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  



The pink sauce is absolutely freakin' fantastic.  it comes with peas and crunchy prosciutto. It is rich, creamy and has a perfect bite from the parmesan sprinkled on top.  I kept having to smack my boyfriends fork away after I gave him a taste, he kept trying to sneak more, he even kept trying to dunk bread into the sauce!  I am totally hooked on it.  



The pizza prices are very reasonable, I plan on checking their pizza out next.",positive
ts42,12/29/2010,revtest3432,5,"Took my parents to this location Christmas Eve for lunch.  Personally I'm a big lunch person because you pay less for almost the same amount of food as dinner time.  That aside, I've been a long time fan of Portofino's (SouthPark, Ayrsley & Eastway locations). There are days I literally CRAVE their pasta Mediterraneo (I always order mine with capellini).  For $7, you can't beat this.  Chopped seafood (definitely has calamari in it) with mussels and all stirred up in a creamy pink sauce... this is my FAV pasta choice.  And yes, I almost always order this dish, which is soooo against my normal rule of trying new things.



Don't forget their bread, which is baked freshly... and a little tip: dip it in their house salad dressing!  OMG... it's awesome! (NOTE: if you are allergic to garlic, or don't like garlic, or don't want to smell like garlic, don't attempt this... but then why on earth are you in an italian restaurant?!)



Their other dishes are good too.  Pizza is huge, and was told to be very authentic NY style.  At my old work we used to order them for lunch, and the cheese would slide all over the place by the time I got it back to work because it's so fresh and hot (hence I'm not a pizza delivery person)



This location isn't as ""fancy"" looking, but it's close to my home.  For more romantic outings... you may want to drive a little further to the Park Road or Ayrsley location.",positive

Sure, the parking lot always said ""MUG ME"", but after my dinner tonight at Portofino's on Eastway, I'll never look at this shopping center the same.



Came in around 6:30 on Saturday and this place was jumpin! Lots of couples, and a few families, we were seated immediately and started off with the Capri - buff.mozz, tomatoes, basil, mushrooms, roasted red peppers and oil/vin/spices. Everything was great, the portion was definitely big enough to split between 4 (there were only 2 of us), and the homemade bread that came out with it.... ohhhh madre, it was excellent. Everything was fresh and well seasoned. 



I chose to go with the Mediterrano (w/ the pink sauce and Capelinni) due to the other reviews about it and whoa - 5 stars! Light, flavorful and multi-leveled, the pink sauce was just as good as my Nana's and I've never been able to compare her to anyone! My date went with the Scilian pizza with sausage and onions. $14.00 for the biggest pizza I have seen in recent memory. He loved it, and we've got the left overs so I'm excited to try it tomorrow (I was too busy making ""MMMM"" sounds to my pasta to try his pizza).



The grand finale left me speechless: THE CANOLI. We ordered 1 each and I swear I could have eaten 15. Filled completely through, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cocao, this canoli was a gift from the gods. I can't remember the last time I had a canoli this good was, and it makes me want to never try anywhere else's canolis because this was just the tip top of the mountain and nothing else is going to ever compare. I'm serious. I'M SERIOUS FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY - this canoli was just amazing.



Service was great, speedy and kind. Parking is easy, abeit a little rough looking. Portofino's, I love you and I love you even more since you're a few blocks from my home. If I ever sell, I will be sure to note you in my ads as a ""plus"" to homeownership around here! :)",positive

I was alone, so I did something kind of shameful...I set out to find the Olive Garden that was tucked away off of Independence Blvd. I found it, but much to my salad-craving chagrin, it was closed. Closed, gone the way of other Independence Blvd. businesses. So no unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks for me. 



I started thinking of where I might find some affordable, but good Italian food, and I remembered Portofino's. It's not in the nicest shopping center ever, but the food is really good, and the prices are very reasonable. For $13 or so, I got stuffed shells, a soda, crusty bread, and a delicious, delightful salad. I was pleased.



The servers were friendly, and the service was quick. There was no line to wait, either, even on a busy Saturday night...so it's a far better option than some of the ""fancier"" Italian restaurants. Yes, this shopping center is kind of creepy, but Portofino's is worth it.",positive

Very friendly and attentive service, just what you'd hope for in a truly neighborhood place. Food was very good, two adults had pasta - linguine was high quality and cooked to al dente greatness, sauces were yummy, portions were (overly) plentiful. only suggestion for the Brasciola sauce was more peas!

I hadn't tried their other dishes until yesterday though, and if the pasta puttanesca and pasta with garlic and broccoli are any indication I need to start working my way through their menu pants size by pants size.



This location may not be in the most inviting shopping center but it is close to my home and my office and I generally pick up my food to go so really I'm not worried (besides, the police are a few doors down in the same strip mall).

Attentive service.

Huge portions ( like 2 meals worth of leftovers huge)

Delicious specials



Although the pasta dishes looked fantastic, I opted for the Seafood Pescatore special. Risotto with a touch of marinara and laden with fruits from the sea - including a half filet of salmon on top.



It was divine as was the Ahi Tuna special served with a side of polenta with a creamy pepper sauce.

For me, the food is much better here and so is the service. The first time I went here, I was picking up some pizzas to take back to the office.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a couple of Italian-Americans whipping up some crazy good pizzas.  The smell of the place told me that I was gonna love the pizza, and I did! 



So, my next visit was for a lunch meeting. We had a great waitress who kept our glasses filled and brought plenty of bread while we were waiting for our entrees.  



On my first dine-in visit, I had one of their specials -  it was chicken lasagne with a white sauce.  Man, was it good!  The portion was huge, so I  had a nice second meal!

This is the ORIGINAL location in Charlotte, and far less crowded than the Park Rd. location.  And personally, I think the food is better.  



We began with an appetizer of roasted red peppers and sliced mozzarella.  There was lots of it, and it really hit the spot. All entrees come with a house salad.  I am in love with their house dressing.  It reminds me more of a creamy French meets Italian dressing.  For my entree, I ordered the the clams in a white sauce over linguine.  This is my go-to Italian dish.  It is overflowing with clam meat (or clam flesh? ew) and in a scrumptious white wine and butter sauce.  WAY too much for me to eat in one sitting.

It was a Friday and I could not eat meat because of Lent. The waiter suggested the ""Mediteraneo,"" which is mixed seafood pasta in a creamy pink sauce. There is a selection of pasta types to choose from including Cappellini, Linguini, Fettuccini, Penne, or Spaghetti Noddles. I chose penne. This was HANDS DOWN, the most amazing pasta dish I have ever had! I am so sorry if you are not a seafood fan, but I'm sure this dish could sway you. I COULD NOT STOP EATING!! The waiter consistently asked how I liked my dish (since he recommended it), which was incredibly sweet. Overall: great food, great setting and great service!

So when my partner suggested we try out the Portofino's on Eastway for lunch one day, I was very skeptical.  ""The rundown plaza in the sketchy part of town where even Walmart moved out of?"" was my response.  We went for lunch and I was literally blown away.  While the location and plaza it's in is suspect, walking into Portofino's, I felt much more assured.  It offered a nice, quaint atmosphere, much better than the one on Park Rd, I think.   We were immediately greeted by several smiling staff members and the dining room was already starting to fill up with people on their lunch breaks.  



Although Portofino's has a large authentic Italian menu with very reasonable prices already, we both opted for one of their equally reasonably priced lunch specials.  My partner had the mushroom ravioli with a reddish cream sauce.  I tried the sauce (I'm not a fan of fungi) and it was delicious and very flavorful.  I ordered the gnocchi special with tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic, and basil.  It, too, had a sauce that was oh-so-flavorable.  It wasn't exactly creamy, but close to it.  I absolutely loved it.  



We also ordered small Caesar salads to start (for not much more) and our server brought us some delicious warm bread that we finished up by sopping up our leftover sauces.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience and our server was super-efficient and very friendly.  I have a newfound respect for Portofino's on Eastway.  I can't say I'd go there at nighttime, but during daylight hours, I'd be happy to any day of the week.",positive
ts42,11/15/2012,revtest3457,4,"I was a little hesitant about this place based on its location in a generally depressing part of town, however I've eaten here twice now and have been taught a lesson about judging a restaurant by its strip mall. 



The owners and managers are an authentic Italian family, and it shows. I like to hear them talk from the kitchen but the noise level in the restaurant is comfortable and makes for easy conversation. I'm a sucker for pasta so the first time I went I ordered the manicotti--it was great but not too exciting (though how exciting can manicotti be, really?), but I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. The next time I had the tortellini alfredo and it was HEAVENLY--the sauce was perfectly creamy, the ham and onions fresh, and the pasta cooked perfectly. And the portion was HUGE! My partner got a large calzone and said it was also great but there was way too much of it, which is always a great complaint about a restaurant, if you ask me. Their dishes are fairly priced and possibly even a little underpriced considering the portions...bring your appetite!



The restaurant itself is small and a little dim, but seems clean enough. The service on my first visit was great, our server was very helpful and patient even though they were about a half hour from closing time. On my second visit we had a different server whom I suspect may have been new to the job, he was a little over-attendant and could never hear what we were saying, even though the restaurant was near-empty and quiet. He was nice, though, and they are very accommodating if you want to change something on the menu or have a specific request. 



I would definitely recommend Portofino's to anyone looking for authentic Italian cuisine, and I'm always looking forward to going back myself.



PS: Every time I visit, I feel like I'm in an episode of The Sopranos. And that is a compliment.",positive
ts42,1/4/2013,revtest3458,4,"My wife and I (along with two of our closest friends in Charlotte) went to Portofinos on Christmas Eve, for the very first time. We were craving Italian food, but didn't want a chain restaurant vibe and found ourselves here. 



The dining area was nice and seemed inviting. Similar to the more authentic Italian places in the Washington, D.C. Area (where I'm from) the servers were a bit older, which was cool. Our server and food runners were very helpful an attentive, and gave excellent entree recommendations. The dining crowd that night consisted of mostly families and it was a lively bunch. 



The meal came with salad and bread. Both of which were fine. My entree (chicken Portofino) first of all was pretty huge and excellent!  I usually finish my entrees in restaurants, but I had to take it home. It was delicious that night and pretty darn delicious for lunch the next day too. The rest of our party enjoyed their meals as well. 



We also found the meal to be very reasonable. Not pricey at all. So oversll, the food was great, the service was great, and the price was great. I cannot wait to take my parents there when they visit. In fact, I can't wait that long, I'll be back there very soon! :)",positive

They feature soft, plentiful steak, onions, peppers, and mushrooms, topped by a generous amount of melted provolone. Even the bread is perfect, soft on the inside with a great crust. The sandwich is HUGE. This is still the best cheesesteak that I've eaten in the Queen City, and maybe anywhere.



Portofino's has great pasta and I love their multiple veal dishes. 



Their house salad is loaded with green olives, strong on the vinegar, and definitely an acquired taste. I will admit that I have grown to love their salads, even though they're simplistic. 



Professional service by waiters who are serious about their job. Every time that I've eaten here the service has been simply first class in all respects. 



The desserts are beautifully made and delicious.

ts42,2/10/2013,revtest3461,5,"My wife and I both grew up in Charlotte, but she had never tried Portofino's as her world revolved around south Charlotte before we got married while I first discovered Portofino's while commuting to UNCC and later moving to the UNCC area.



I told my wife for 2 years she needed to try out Portofino's and once I got her to go...she suggested we go back again within a week saying some of the best Italian food she's ever had.  I think perhaps the best eggplant parm in town.



Portofino's is really a hidden gem where every friend I've taken turns into an instant fan.  The food is every bit as good as Maggiano's over at South Park and better than the lesser competition like Carrabba's or Olive Garden.",positive

I have a tendency to carry out, but every time we have eaten in over the years, we havethoroughly enjoyed the service, and have had some very tasty pasta dishes as well.  



As noted elsewhere, this is not a fancy or pretentious place, just great food served by people who work hard to make the best italian meal you can find for the price in Charlotte.",positive
ts42,4/24/2013,revtest3463,5,"First off, this whole review is based off To-Go, so I just wanted to note this.....



I grew up in New York and just moved to Charlotte from just outside New York City....basically Italian Central!  I have ate a ton of great Italian food and am Italian myself.



When I walked into Portofino, I felt like I was back in Westchester!  Slices on the counter, garlic knots....all of the good stuff.



I have not had the pizza, but have tried a few dinners.  The stuffed shells were awesome, and included a huge portion!  The chicken Parm was great, and again huge portion.  All meals are served with a salad (delicous homemade ""house"" dressing and a full small loaf of freshly baked bread.



This place is in a somewhat sketch plaza on Eastway.....it's kinda weird that it's there, but that doesn't really matter!  It is my new ""Go to"" Italian spot when I want a taste of home.",positive
ts42,5/15/2013,revtest3464,5,"I have had take out and dine in here and I just love this place. It is a quaint little Italian place where the atmosphere make you feel like you are in Italy. So far I have had most all types of pizza here, chicken parmigiana, lasagna, salads, pretty much almost the whole menu. Take out is great too, even they way they pack your food. I can call it in on my way home from work and its always ready. I am fortunate to live a mile away from here. 



If you get the chance visit this place or order take out. It is great food at a great price, and customer service is always great!",positive
ts42,6/16/2013,revtest3465,5,"Finally we've found Italian that we like in this city!!  We live close to Portifino's, but have been putting off going there.  We had a pretty bad experience with Dolce, and had been told that good Italian is an impossibility in Charlotte.  I had a good feeling about this place when I walked in the door.  It smelled amazing, and had that perfect non pretentious atmosphere that a good Italian place should have.  I ended up ordering the Tortellini Alfredo, and my special lady friend had the Chicken Sorrento.  Both were amazing.  It made the other Italian I've had in Charlotte look like Chef Boyardee.  It was difficult, but somehow we managed to reign back and save a little room for dessert.  We had the Cannoli, and the Tiramisu.  The filling in the Cannoli almost brought a tear to my eye.  The Tiramisu was a huge portion, and was some of the best I've ever had.  All in all I plan on this place being our go to Italian, and I can't wait to go back and try their pizza!",positive
ts42,6/18/2013,revtest3466,4,"I admit, I have lived reasonably close to Portofino's for almost 2 years and never once even seriously considered driving here.  Why, you may ask?  I have been told by many a person that you can't get decent, reasonably-priced Italian food here.  However, I can't imagine that the people who told me this had ever sat foot inside this little slice of paradise.



This place is flippin' awesome!  I rarely ever order or eat marinara sauce at restaurants; however, Portofino's has some of the best marinara I've ever eaten in my life.  It is such a perfect balance of flavors paired with high quality ingredients, without the need of complicated flavors to mask low-quality ingredients.  It's not too sweet, not too salty, and has a great tomato flavor.  On the first trip, I ordered the Chicken Sorrento, which included a large chicken breast.  Not only did the food taste fresh and flavorful, the portions were definitely big enough for dinner and plenty of leftovers for the next day.  My partner ordered the Tortellini Alfredo, which was very rich and satisfying.  For dessert, we ordered the cannoli and the tiramisu.  The filling in the cannoli was very rich and sweet, yet the shell was still crisp and not soggy.  The tiramisu was magical - the best I've ever had.  The marscapone was very smooth-tasting and the coffee flavor was not overpowering.  On the second visit, we ordered a pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.  Again, I loved the sauce, but the crust was a little too thin in places to hold up to the toppings.  I will definitely say they do NOT skimp on the toppings and cheese, which was super.  The sauce and crust were wonderful otherwise, and this is a pretty solid place to get pizza.  We also ordered the garlic knots, which were drizzled with buttery-oil mixture and garlic.  They were a little too small to adequately absorb all the flavors, but they were decent.



As for service and decor, this place is amazing.  Our waitress was so helpful and sweet to us, I just adored her.  While the plaza that houses this restaurant looks slightly (or moderately) questionable, this place is very open and nice-looking on the inside.  I loved the decor, with comfortable tables and an open look inside.  



I am sad I did not try this place sooner, but now that I know it's there, I have a bad feeling I'll be going there too often.  I may possibly dream of their marinara sauce tonight.",positive
ts42,7/1/2013,revtest3467,4,"I've been wanting to try out a new pizza place, but it makes it hard when I have Villa Francesca and Hawthorne's close by.  My friend told me about Portofino's, telling me it was his favorite spot for a NY style pie.  I gave them a call last Saturday night when we felt like staying in for the night.



Don't be disturbed by the shopping center it's located in.  It's one grungy, depressing area.  I already knew that ahead of time, so it didn't bother me.  There were a few guys behind the counter, but the bald guy with the heavy Italian accent was funny as hell.  He asked me about my day and if I had any plans for the 4th of July holiday.  I told him about my plans and he wished me well and to be safe.  I didn't really expect such a nice, warm greeting.  That's customer service!



The pizza was great too.  A perfect NY style pie.  I was just in NYC last month, so I've got street cred!  There's a reason this place has 4.5 stars.  I think this might be my favorite pizza in CLT now, but I need to try it out a few more times before I go that far.  I'm pretty sure I'll be bumping it up to 5 stars in the not too distant future.",positive

Food: Really reasonable prices for the huge portions of food. The quality of the pasta, tastiness of the sauces, ceasar salad fixings, and homemade bread were all amazing. Shrimp Parmesan gets two thumbs up. Split an appetizer, salad, bread, and entree and took home a full meal for leftovers. 



Wine: Selection was okay. Mostly 6/glass and 24/bottle, all Italian. The reds we got were tasty.

ts42,11/4/2013,revtest3472,5,"Stopped in for an early dinner on Saturday evening.  I had missed lunch and was starving.  I rarely get over to this part of town and it had been well over a year since I had visited.  So even though it was only 4:45 PM, I figured I would visit again.  So glad I did.



Even though it was so early, there were already a few tables filled and the carryout pizza was flying out the door.  By the time I left a little after 6:00, the place was pretty full.



I was promptly greeted and seated, and quickly attended to by my server Todd.  Great guy.  Very friendly.  His service was stellar.



I started with the appetizer special of a large Portobello mushroom cap stuffed with a crab filling and topped with a balsamic reduction and served over a bed of sautéed spinach.  Delicious. I followed with a entre special of Osso Bucco (did I spell that right?) with a side of Gnocchi.  Again, simply delicious.  



All in all, a terrific experience.  Great food and service, with a comfortable and quaint atmosphere.  I'll need to try harder to get over that way more often......",positive
ts42,11/8/2013,revtest3473,3,"Why is Italian food kind of hard to find in Charlotte? Plenty of Mexican places. After yelping some Italian joints I saw Portofino's come up with rave reviews. This place is right next to the Atlantic Farmer's Market. I've always assumed the whole strip mall stunk due to how it smells in Atlantic Farmer's Market, which is awful in case you were wondering. Portofino's is nice inside and doesn't really fit the area it is in but maybe that is what makes it special. We got salads to go with our carbs and asked for Italian dressing. Our server told us the house was their Italian but it was creamy and had egg yolks in it. Okay, game on. The dressing was pretty bland but with some salt and pepper I know it's got potential.



My date got the fettuccine primavera and I got the fettuccine casalinga. The caslinga is marinara, peas, and veal. I asked if I could opt out of the marinara for pink sauce since I've had an aversion to restaurant marinaras all my life. Our server allowed me to make the switch which was cool. I thought it was good on first bite but then began to realize how much cheese/cream/salt was in it. It was sickening by the third bite. The veal on it was tender and very good. My date wanted to switch plates but then realized how rich my dish was as well. His primavera was quite good and the broccoli in it seemed fresh. Both of our pastas were al dente. The primavera with my dish's veal would have made for some Optimus Prime level shit. I boxed the fettuccine caslinga up and added a half cup of water to it on the stove top the next day, it came out perfect. 



We also got garlic bread, and it was a lot (portion wise) for what we paid for but I kind of felt like I was eating carpet dust. No IN YOUR FACE garlic factor either. I wanted to order the clams casino but I was still weary of the fact that we were in a seedy strip mall. How good could seedy strip mall clams casino really be?



Honestly, give this place a shot. One of our pastas (primavera) was excellent and the other one would have been if the salt/cream was toned down a bit. Portofino's is kind of like the underdog kickball team, which makes them likable, but not the best. They just need a little more practice.",negative

Now I tend to order off the menu (garlic and broccoli with penne all day!!!) and eat on the leftover for at least two more meals.



I largely wanted to write this review in response to previously mentioned safety concerns for the area. I may be a bit biased because I grew up in this neighborhood and still visit it frequently, but I'm not sure where the fear comes from...I mean, this parking lot is shared with a police station... 

I'm a petite female in my twenties and I have never once felt unsafe or threatened here or across the street where the Ross is and I have visited that Food Lion on more than one occasion late at night. 

Please do not let your suspicions about the safety of the neighborhood keep you from this gem! I am always afraid that I will lose my favorite Italian Restaurant because they can't stay afloat on that side of town.

Most places that claim they have the best have garbage in my opinion.

If not, you may find yourself waiting for refills and such for longer than desired.  The pizza is about what you'd expect; typical ""New York Style"" pizza but quite greasy.  The bread served at the table is AMAZING and is even better if you ask for a side of their house dressing for dipping!  Trust me on this one!  I've tried a few other menu items beyond the pizza.  Some good, some not so good.  It all depends on your taste and familiarity.  Most dishes that I didn't like were the result of me branching out to try a little something new.  All in all, it's decent Italian food.  I was a little put off during my last trip by the servers attempt to ""charge"" for a refill of the bread basket for the table.

Our server was the nicest man!  He said, "" you look like a wine drinker,"" and offered me a sample of an Italian red that wasn't on the menu.  So good, and it was only $6.00!

My friend got the pasta fagoli soup, and a pasta dish featuring salmon.  I ordered the Gorgonzola tortellini minus the grilled chicken strips.  Our meals came with bread and salads, featuring some if the tastiest blue cheese dressing.  My plentiful dish was so good that I could have drunk the sauce if my manners were subpar.

Go sometime for the other dishes- everything is good. Don't get sucked into thinking it is just pizza.



The owners/staff are warm, hilarious, hospitable and genuinely get to know you. We have had a good/ongoing rapport with most of the staff for years now. They treat us very well. If you become a regular- they will treat you like family.

The only two things that I would say are negatives is that the place tends to get very loud with a lot of background noise from neighboring tables. And the coffee refills aren't free.



Great bagel flavors, including several that they don't have at Panera. I like the Pumpernickel and the Jalapeno. Both are excellent. These are ""real"" bagels, unlike the stuff you might pick up a supermarket. They're made the right way, even if they aren't as good as New York. (Ha ha.)

The bagels are nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Mmmm carb heaven.

This place is only open for breakfast and lunch. I've gotten the smoked salmon bagel for lunch and it comes with my choice of veggies, all fresh and crunchy!

The bagels were fresh & they make sandwiches to order even though there are any great selections.

What an excellent selection of bagels and varieties at this location! I stopped in for lunch and to catch up on some work and was more than pleasantly surprised with my visit.



I walked up to the counter and everyone was smiling and singing to the music, very happy to help and that is what will keep me coming back as a customer! I ordered the trio, by far the best deal on the menu...you get any bagel sandwich, soup or chips and a drink for $6.99. 



I chose the turkey chipotle (turkey and peppered bacon) on a rosemary and olive oil bagel with lettuce, jalapeños, onions and chipotle mayo. Toasted, of course with chips as my side. I asked that they make the bacon extra crispy and they were more than happy to oblige :) 



The sandwich was absolutely delish! Loved the rosemary and olive oil bagel and they piled on the toppings! The chips are all kettle cooked, my absolute favorite so I was clearly a fan!



Best thing about this place outside of that customer service and yummy food was the abundance of outlet plugs and booths for everyone to enjoy the free Wi-Fi!!! Everywhere I looked there was a chair or booth and outlet which was wonderful! And I don't know if it a regular thing but the tunes today were amazing...nothing but old school classics...I could help but bop my head and jam on....

Two of the times we've been, we sat outside and enjoyed the breeze while we sipped margaritas. 



There's about a billion vegetarian options, which always works for me. I see Kelly C. didn't like her chile relieno, but I've always liked mine. I have a friend who lived in Texas for a while, so now she is kind of ruined for NC Mexican food...I've not gotten my taste buds retrained, however, so I am still a fan.

It's in a strip mall.  I decided to try it and once I got in there, I was amazed.  They've decorated and themed the inside of this strip mall restaurant very nicely to resemble a Mexican restaurant.  It's also divided into separate areas, making each a little more private.  I was impressed.



They bring you chips and salsa to start like any good Mexican restaurant.  They're nothing out of the ordinary, but they always taste so good to whet your appetite.  The salsa comes in a little decanter which you can then pour into your salsa bowl(s).  It's unnecessary, but the presentation of it is very nice.  



The food choices are your basic Mexican menu items.  I usually get one of the lunch combos.  For about $6, you can't go wrong.  It comes with a couple of choices, rice, and a side item.  My favorite is the combo with the soft chicken taco and chile relleno (which isn't really a stuffed chile, it's more of a pile of mush of cheese and very finely chopped chile, but oh-so-good), with a ""salad"" on the side consisting of shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and guacamole.  Yum.  



Like I said, the items are only about $6 a person and they really fill you up.  For a sit-down lunch restaurant, it's an awesome and delicious deal.",positive

ts44,6/7/2010,revtest3509,5,"I will begin this review by saying I bought my first condo based on it's close proximity to this particular Monterrey's.  I'm not sure if that's sad or a good move on my part.  The old school Charlotteans will remember this as the former site of the famous (in my heart at least) Rainbow Deli.  Monterrey has done a great job over the last seven or so years making this reborn location a fun hangout with unbeatable service and food that I constantly crave.



It's not often I take my little ""Mini-Me"" out in the evenings- At the end of the day, I'm not mentally prepared for toddler-sized meltdowns before the food arrives.  Monterrey is always the exception to this rule.  Our plates come out so darn quickly, and in the meantime, there are several waiters to come by and make funny faces at her to pass the time!  Although I haven't lived in the area for several years, they still know me by name and I'm treated like family as soon as I walk in.  I used to think I was just special, but I've heard several people with the same experience.



I've had almost everything on the menu, but the Cheese Steak Burrito is my ""Old Faithful.""  Their Sangria is pretty remarkable and the margaritas are decent.  The best part:  The Dos Equis drafts are so cold, the ice particles form on the outside of the glass- Delightful.  My absolute favorite is meeting friends on their substantial, covered deck with some cheese dip and cold beers.  I've had birthday parties here, bridal showers, etc. and they are completely hospitable to everything.

Maybe a little below average. I'd probably give it a 2 or 2.5 for what I had. My server was very attentive and the food came out fast though. The main reason I have no reasons giving the place a solid 3 is because I think it could be better than my experience. They have plenty of authentic Mexican dishes which you don't normally see outside of Cali. Normally, I would have gotten one of these but was feeling like Fajitas.

We started out with the queso that came out so quickly and was very good! I had the the Arroz Con Camerones the shrimp had good flavor as did the guacamole it came with, it was just missing something. My boyfriend had the Ribeye which came with rice and beans and grilled onions and peppers with fried potatoes and he seemed to like it.

Luckily for them I've eaten here many times so I will return! The food is good, and all at a very reasonable cost. Queso dip is always a great way to start, along with the margaritas. Both always tasty and delightful! Strawberry frozen is my recommendation :) The food has usually been good for me and the waitstaff is always pretty quick with service.

Has great lunch specials and it is super fast (so you can enjoy your lunch without having to watch the clock too much).  Chips and salsa were kept on the table - The salsa has a medium kick to it (just right) and I can pretty much down a whole basket of chips myself (SAD, but true).

As has been mentioned by other reviewers, this spot is a bit funky.  While you can see it from Harris, it is almost always in a ""oh, there is Monterrey"" discussion, so that you are passing by going one way or the other and it is nearly always too late to figure out just how to get into the parking lot.



Should you happen to figure it out, then the food is not bad, and pretty similar to the other location in Matthews - fairly standard, perhaps skewing to the high end, Americanized Mexican fare.

ts44,9/12/2011,revtest3520,4,"I eat here quite often.  It isn't great Mexican food, but it is pretty good and the best in the neighborhood.



One plate I would like to recommend is El combo.  It comes with a LOT of food.  I usually only eat half and save the other half for lunch the next day.  It all comes with beef but you can sub chicken for any item at a cost of $0.25.  The hard taco and the Chalupa are best eaten that night.  The chili rellano could have more pepper in it.  



The margaritas are hit or miss.  Sometimes they will be strong and sometimes they will be a little weak.  On Mondays medium margaritas are $5.50 and they are pretty good sized.  I think on Thursdays they have beer on special.  



If it is your birthday, they let you wear a sombrero and give you a fried flour tortilla with a whip cream smiley face on it.  It may come with some syrup and a cherry too.  You do not get to keep the hat like I thought, they will chase you down and ask for it back.",positive

Their queso dip and margs are pretty tasty. The menu is quite extensive- usually I just grab a taco or burrito, but they have many other options.

Sitting outside in the nice cool breeze, drinking a refreshingly large Margarita out of one of their fishbowl-sized glasses, is usually the setting for my visits to this Mexican eatery. Rarely do I go for the festive ""Mexi-Charlotte nightlife"". I decided to try out their dinner-time demeanor. Granted it was during Cinco de Mayo (which ponders a question....Do yo think Mexico celebrates Fourth of July with fireworks and Jack & Cokes or Vodka & Redbulls?....Anyways...) so I kept that in mind when formulating my review here.

     I believe the food at Monterrey to be some of the best bang for your buck when it comes to Mexican food. I have eaten similar items prepared IN Mexico and it is quite comparable. They started us out with chips and salsa (probably one of my favorites) and drinks (for Cinco de Drinko, I went with a house Margarita out of a red Solo cup). Atmosphere was enjoyable and festive with a live DJ for this auspicious Mexican occasion, everyone seemed to be having a good time. That is, until the food came.

     Luckily for this Ginger getting his Mexican on, his order was accurate. The same can't be said about other folks in the group. Some getting guacamole when they opted out, others glaring at the ones who got it in envy. Then when asked for refills on chips and salsa, our table watched in horror as they picked up a mini-carafe and bowl of chips from a table that had just cleared. We politely, but sternly, declined the gently used basket of chips and salsa. What was going on?

     I generally rate Monterrey 4-5 stars in my books, albeit Cinco de Mayo, some qualities you just don't sacrifice. It seemed the service and quality was sacrificed that night a bit amidst the festivities. I will go back there, but I believe it will be for my Enchiladas and Fishbowl Margaritas from here on out.",negative

ts45,12/20/2008,revtest3540,4,"Villa Antonio is one of those places that can go in a number of directions, so you may have to cross your fingers when you go through the door.  I've been at least three times, and each time has been completely different.



To the credit of the restaurant, the last time was the best - so it is possible that you could say that they are getting better.  It's also possible that you could say that they are just hit-and-miss.  I'll leave that call up to you.



The first time I went, we arrived when they were busy, and the only seat that they had was next to the kitchen.  The place was packed, and we had not reservations, so it was good that we had a seat at all.  As you might expect, however, sitting next to the kitchen wasn't a good idea.  Also, being there when they were busy also wasn't good.  It was a bit of a zoo in there.



On the second visit, we went at lunch to the buffet, which wasn't impressive at all.  While service was better and the overall experience was improved, the food just wasn't that great.  Unlike some, I don't mind a good buffet, but this one wasn't.



Most recently we went just before the dinner rush - and we weren't even dressed appropriately - and had our pick of seats.  It's also worth mentioning that this was after they remodeled the place.  Service had improved quite a bit, we weren't sitting next to the kitchen and everything was much, much better.  By the time we were done it was even well into what we would expect to be a dinner rush, and the place was still nearly empty.  So I wonder if perhaps something has changed.  We might have to drop in again to see.



I don't know if they somehow managed to figure out that I wrote this - though I can't imagine how they would do that - but they sent me a gift card (just $5, but a gift card is a gift card).  I don't recall signing up for anything, but maybe I did at some point.  Who knows?",positive
ts45,6/15/2009,revtest3541,4,"Found this place while driving outside the airport before I had to catch a flight. Was tired of eating at the usual places in the airport, so ventured out and found a good meal.  I got there ~5:30 on a Friday, so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too stuffy, and the staff courteous and attentive.



I perused the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, ribeye w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, complimentary tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the entree. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some parts and tiramisu was good  though espresso was faint if there at all.



Overall, I thought this was a very good deal for the food, service and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well worth it.",positive

ts45,5/1/2010,revtest3543,5,"Been to this place a few times.  From the beginning of this year, every last Tuesday of the month, a salsa dance use the bar area to hold a free class at 7:30pm then social party till 11:00 pm.  During such time, wine is half price abt $3.50 - $4 or $5.-  They have good collections of wine and they use classic wide wine class with a generous portion.  I love that.

Then their appetizers are also half price.  Really great.  Beer is abt $2.00 or $2.50.  Whisky is a little more.  Still affordable.

They have good food and the atmosphere is above average.  Better dress up a little before you go.

They recently have many features and special.  Check that out if you are interested for a nice dinner in couple or party.  Love this place too.",positive
ts45,6/18/2010,revtest3544,4,"I have always passed my this place and had never stopped in until and ex was wanted to try them and boy was i glad we did. As you walk in you are taken away from the hustle and bustle of being on South Blvd, and is kinda taken to a different place. The decor is very nice and upscale. I must admit they were a little pricey but in my opinion they were will worth it, The portions are huge and they are enough to feed two people. The staff is amazing and are willing to go the extra mile to make sure your happy and that everything is going great. The night we went the owner was there and offered free drinks and I'm down for a free drink anytime.. lol but over all i would rate this a 4 out of 5",positive
ts45,9/29/2010,revtest3545,4,"This place was recommended to us by a neighbor after our disastrous meal at Mama Ricotta's. We had driven by many times and, from it's exterior, gave it a pass because of it's Olive Garden-like vibe.



Actually, inside, it's a nice old-school Italian feel to it. There is a bar with live music and tables on one side and a dining room on the other. We showed up on a Friday night without reservations and got a table easy.



My husband and I always judge a new Italian restaurant by it's Chicken Parmesan, a classic entree.  It's like a turkey club sandwich -- if you somehow eff it up, I am not interested in your more complicated dishes. There parm was very good: not too much cheesy gunk and nicely cooked and spiced. I had a veal chop that was out of this world. 3 days later when I ate the microwaved leftovers it was still delicious!



They have a dessert cart that they roll table-side. Out server tried to steer us away from a couple of options, which I appreciate. The desserts we tried were fine, but not stellar -- an ordinary bread pudding and cheesecake.



At the end of the meal one of the staff handed me a hand-written coupon for $20 off our next meal, which was a nice touch.



It's a bit spendy, but the overall experience was worth it and we will probably take my parents here when they visit next month.",positive
ts45,10/1/2010,revtest3546,4,"The hubby and I had a restaurant.com coupon that brought us to Villa Antonio.  I didn't read any reviews for this place before we went and based on the location I assumed the restaurant wouldn't be too upscale.  To my surprise this place was pretty fancy.  When we first walked in the host was a bit of a jokester.  He made a few comments about taking care of the pretty lady as he kissed my hand (creepy??) and left Mr. P to take care of himself. 



 Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful, almost to the point of being bothersome when we were in the middle of a conversation.  He would end up standing at our table talking to us about the food for what sometimes seemed like an excessive amount of time.  At least he was thorough. 



The food was pretty good.  I had angel hair pesto with shrimp and a side of asparagus and portobello mushrooms.  The hubby had the lobster ravioli with shrimp.  I didn't enjoy my pasta as much as I enjoyed the lobster ravioli, but that's just personal preference.  However, the asparagus and mushrooms were delicious!  The asparagus was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of seasoning and the mushrooms melted in my mouth.  We followed everything up with a strawberry shortcake dessert that was delightful.  



I don't know if the food is worth the money, but what you're really paying for is the whole dining experience.  The servers are on top of everything and they like to make the whole evening a show.  They will describe all of the daily specials and give recommendations for wine pairings.  When they bring out your entree plate it has a silver dome cover on top that they rattle around on the plate for dramatic effect before revealing the contents inside.  The whole evening was quite entertaining.  I believe this is the first time I've ever had the waiter shake my hand at the end of the meal.  It's definitely a great place to go on a first date.  



We'll be back to try out some other entrees since I was slightly disappointed in my pasta.",positive
ts45,10/1/2010,revtest3547,4,"Service was outstanding. From the moment we walked in, we were immediately greeted and escorted to our table, It was as if someone had called them and told them we were coming and we would most likely be writing a review (or two) on our experience. Or you know how when the bigwigs of your company are going to stop by and everyone has to pretend to love their job and work a little harder? That's what it felt like, which was a good thing. 



As always at any restaurant, i am a big fan of complementary food without ordering (like all Mexican restaurants chips and salsa). Bruschetta was served when we were seated and even though it wasn't really my favorite thing, i was much obliged. Also served was some awesome i-can't-remember-the-name bread. Yes we will have another round of free yet delicious bread please.  

 

i don't do wine, but the list looked extensive. Had it been a beer list, i would've been giddy.  



i was really craving some good old fashion lasagna, but couldn't resist the lobster ravioli served with some mushrooms and 3 obese shrimp. Turned out to be a delicious choice. As a side we ordered the portobello mushrooms and asparagus. The shrooms were perfect and the asparagus were good. Will definitely get that side again. 

For dessert, i ventured outside of my chocolaty coated, chocolate filled comfort zone and tried the strawberry shortcake. Another excellent choice. Either i happened to select every delicious thing on their menu or this place may be pretty solid across the menu. 



i have to mention that in the midst of this fancy Italian meal, the lights go out and out they come with an anniversary cake singing Happy Anniversary (to the tune of Happy Birthday) to a couple there celebrating their anniversary. It was very TGI Fridays like. i'm still not sure if i approve or not. i suppose it made me feel better about being in jeans, although when placing our drink orders we felt like we were almost frowned upon when we didn't order any wine.   



Even with the $25 restaurant.com certificate, we still spent a pretty penny and in the end, i value my cash more than i need royal treatment, so i'd be content with the Olive Garden unless i need to impress. It makes me doubt my math skills when the tip alone approaches the cost of most of our meals out.",positive
ts45,10/31/2010,revtest3548,4,Stumbled in here during a storm. The food was excellent but prepare for a calorie splurge.  Would have liked to try the desert but had no room.  The service was old fashioned and first class.,positive

This is a must visit while in Charlotte!",positive
ts45,7/21/2011,revtest3551,4,"My husband and I really enjoyed this place.  It is more expensive than most places, and yes, you probably could find the same dish elsewhere for ten bucks less.  But you know how much the food costs before you go there. 



My husband's father owned a couple over restaurants and was born and raised in Sicily.  So needless to say, he knows Italian food.  That being said, we were not disappointed.  I thought the food was great and the portions were big.   I got the Osso Bucco.  The veal was fall off the bone good.  And they left the bone marrow, which most restaurants don't do.  



I also really liked the atmosphere.  Its felt like something more classic, traditional.  And it was intimate.  The wait staff was also great.  



If you are going for a special event and expect to pay more, I don't think you will be disappointed.",positive

From the greeting at the door from Anthony, Fidel or Walter...to the great service provided throughout the dinner...to the great multi-course meals....Villa Antonio always hits the mark!  The wife and I had a great dinner before going to a local jazz concert.  Fresh focaccia with balsamic EVOO dip....and the fresh bruschetta....all so very good.  The lemon sorbet with extra dry brut provided the best palate cleanser!!  And the wine selection is always amazing!!  We had a great pairing of delicious red wine....(Yes RED goes well with everything) and our waiter never asked our preference!!  Why....because that is how good they are with pairing!  Dinner was great...the dishes are always well prepared and so so so full of flavor.  And the portions are so great...you have to think a minute before you decide on the tiramasu or other wonderful dessert ...or do I just get a box and take some home!  So...on this particular evening....we passed on dessert.!!! And passed on the boxes...and cleaned our plates!",positive
ts45,9/15/2011,revtest3553,4,"Villa Antonio is kind of like a tamale; corny on the outside, delicious on the inside. When I first spotted this restaurant upon moving to Charlotte, I couldn't help but notice the out of place exterior on South Boulevard. The sign is a little dorky and it looks like some crazy Italian villa...next to a Walgreens. The interior, however, has a very romantic italian feel with low lighting and candles on the tables. From the moment we arrived, and before we even walked through the door, the service was incredible. We were promptly greeted by the owner (who kissed my hand, yes, really) and one of the managers who opened the doors. We were seated immediately and didn't have to wait long for our server to take our drink order. The wine selection is immense and takes a while to get through, but our server was good about checking back with us without being a pest. After we finally decided, we were presented with one of the best bruschettas I've ever had. It was seriously good and seriously gratis. I love little touches like that at restaurants, they really set the place apart. We thought that was great and didn't even expect bread, but after ordering our food, we got more delicious treats in the form of warm foccacia with yummy ""italian butter"" (balsamic and EVOO). 



We couldn't decide what to order because everything looked so good, but we finally went with the beef wellington and this ""purse pasta"" (sacchietta maybe??) that was filled with cheese and proscuttio in a delish sauce. We let the server know we wanted to share them, so maybe needed a small plate. He said he would let the chef know and see what he could do. The beef wellington takes a while to prepare (menu says 30 minutes) and while we were waiting the service continued to be stellar. The owner, the manager and our server took turns refilling our wine glasses and water and making sure we were still doing well.



After about 30 minutes, our food was presented under silver domes (so fancy!). The server pulled off the lids to reveal that the chef had already split the entrees between the two plates and even prepared TWO smaller beef wellingtons! I couldn't believe the trouble the went to to prepare two separate entrees for us. Even after being divided, the portions were still HUGE! The only reason I can't give this review 5 stars is because the beef was a fair amount over, but I will note that beef wellington is very hard to not overcook. And it was delicious anyway...



Overall, this is a really great place. The prices are a bit high for the food, but the ambiance is good and the service is outstanding. Definitely a great spot for a night out with your special guy or gal.",positive
ts45,9/22/2011,revtest3554,4,"I have been to the Villa ANtonio restaurant in Ballantyne many times.  I typically get the Chicken Parmesan, always delicious.  I have gotten the fired calamari every time I have been in there, it's always delicious.  The fried calamari is the real deal, barely any rings (if at all).  As for the South Boulevard location.  Today was my first trip there for lunch.  They had the lunch buffet.  The lunch buffet was excellent.  Good variety, including a salad bar, 3-4 types of pasta (Penne Carbanara, cheese ravioli, ziti w/spinach andd sausage, and a pasta with seafood) , chicken marsala, meatloaf, and minestrone soup.  Other reviewers have said the buffet items change.  Service was also excellent.  The cost was also very reasonable, only $9.99.  I plan to eat here weekly now.",positive

ts45,1/12/2012,revtest3557,4,"MMMMM GOOD Italian food!  I have only been here for lunch, but dammmnnn!   9.95 for their lunch buffet is a steal.  There are tons of options and its a buffet. So ladies line your purse with tin foil or ziplock bags.    I usualy take clients here for lunch because its a steal and they really enjoy the food.  The ambience of this place is perfect for business and it seems like it would be a good date spot as well.  The only negative I had was that I deviated from the buffet once and tried the Villa Sinatra.  Which is a filet mignon sandwich on ciabatta.  It was really friggin good, but it didnt seem like super tender filet that I am used to.  Other than that, this will be my go to place for lunch meetings or when I am feeling like being a fatty.",positive

Good, friendly service and welcoming  atmosphere. I'm sure my reviews will get more snarky with time, but for a 6 dollar buffet lunch (9.95 without a coupon?) this couldn't be beat.",positive
ts45,3/12/2012,revtest3559,3,"Villa Antonio is a nice place to take a date but for heavens sake take advantage of a check in deal or living social deal as it is a bit overpriced in my opinion. 



You get several nice additions at no-charge including a lemon sorbet with Veuve champagne pallet cleanser and a small piece of bruschetta. The former was delicious the latter a pale comparison of their actual bread which is served warm and has a beautiful light rosemary flavor. 



We were heavily up-sold on everything we ordered. We wanted two glasses of Malbec...not a bottle... yes were absolutely-positively sure. My boyfriend wanted the chicken Parmesan but was told no and told to get something else (the server literally took the menu from his hand and picked out another meal).  My bf appreciated his pushiness ...I did not and felt a bit uncomfortable explaining that he did in fact know what he would like to eat for dinner.  I will say other than that he was very attentive and overall a good server who just needed to tone it down a bit. 



Most meals are in the high 20's to 30's range. I went with the lobster ravioli which was ok but next time I would steer clear of the pasta. Let me say I am picky when it comes to pasta and I make quite a bit of it at home. I felt their Béchamel  was  flour-heavy and lacked flavor. Portions are quite big so you will not leave hungry. 



The desserts looked great but we were way too full. I definitely would give this place another shot (especially with some great half-off deals going on right now) but I would try some seafood or another protein versus the pasta.",negative
ts45,4/4/2012,revtest3560,3,"OVERPRICED. My friend and I used a coupon for $40 off and our bill was still $80 without tip. Here's a tip: When the waiter suggests a side dish for your entree, find out if the dish is a la carte, or included with the entree. Yes, the food itself was very good and the service was also very good, but we thought we were getting a good deal and we felt bamboozled in the end.

My only complaint was that it was pricey. Two people, bottle of wine, small appetizer, shared salad, two entrees, and desert-  $110. Given that was more than your average dinner, but you should expect to pay in upwards around $20-30 for most of their entrée items, before tax and gratuity. 



I will say in the grand scheme of things, you really are paying for the upscale qualities of food, service, and atmosphere here- and they can really pull this off. As for myself, I may only eat here once in a blue moon. Great for special occasions and dinners on your company's tab!",positive

ts45,12/24/2012,revtest3568,4,"As yearly tradition dictates, my boss takes all of my group out to lunch to celebrate surviving another year.  My boss's favorite type of food is ""a lot"", so he tries to force us to go to a buffet every year.  Normally, since I am the one who coordinates the outing and I am not a fan of standing in line for and then carrying my food, we do not go to a buffet.  This year, he won out and we did a lunch buffet, and that was a good thing!



I called Villa Antonio ahead of time and spoke to a very friendly young woman on the phone (Rebecca, I believe) who I made the reservation with.  She explained that we wouldn't be in our own room, but we would be sectioned off for ""semi-private"" dining.  Good enough.  I reminded all of my group ahead of time to please wear a shirt and shoes to work that day and upon inspection we could be seen in public so off we went.  



Villa Antonio is located near the intersection of South and Woodlawn (located directly across the street from the Home Depot that my group worked on, so we go to see a jobsite as well).  The parking looks like it is going to be sketchy if you look at the front of the building, but there is plenty of parking behind the building (you can also go next door to Pier 1 and walk off some of the carbs when you are done).



Our group of 17 arrived in groups of 3 or so and we were taken to a room towards the back that was cordoned off by a black curtain.  We weren't all crammed in together and all had ample room to maneuver to the buffet as well as eat. Drink orders were promptly taken and kept refilled.  Fresh, warm delicious bread was put on the table with dipping oils.  



The buffet doesn't have a huge selection, which is a good thing as that means items are turned quickly and don't sit out.  The day we went there was a small salad section, lasagna, a chicken pesto pasta, meatballs, chicken something, roasted veggies, a cheesy potato casserole type dish and some other items (I was full after my first pass so I don't recall every item).  All of the items were hot and tasted fresh.  The potato casserole was delicious, as was the lasagna and and the chicken pesto pasta.  Another large group came in behind us, so waiting in line became a bit tedious for others, but I would think during the average day any other time of year that it wouldn't be packed to the rafters will people.



A dessert tray was brought out, but most of us were stuffed and needed to get back to the office to meet a deadline, but the desserts looked good as well.



I believe the buffet, drink included, was only $10, so that is a great deal if you like quality food as well as quantity.  Great meal, service was wonderful (refilling drinks, clearing plates) and the price was right.",positive
ts45,1/28/2013,revtest3569,3,"My fiance and I went here after purchasing a Yelp deal as we had driven past the restaurant many times and never made it in!  Let me start by saying the staff were extremely attentive and accomodating (though borderline suffocating at times) but it was also a Wednesday evening before restaurant week so perhaps it was abnormally quiet.  



We weren't planning to have wine with dinner but couldn't resist when they told us it was 1/2 priced bottles night.  We had a tasty Malbec and for half price it was a great deal!



The food was good.  Is is bad I don't really know what else to say than that?  I had a pasta dish with a variety of shellfish in a vodka sauce and my fiance had the chicken parmesan .  Everything I would say was average - portions were plentiful, food was flavorful but nothing really wowed me.  Had I not had the Yelp deal I imagine I would have been a little disappointed in paying $28 for a pasta dish that was just good.  



With that being said, I will file this restaurant in the ""Wouldn't choose to return but would be fine with someone suggesting we go there"" section of my dining rolodex.  For what it's worth, I think there is much better food (particularly Italian) at other places that can offer the same dining experience at half the price.",negative

I went for the salmon which is covered with crab meat, so I was already excited upon ordering... lol The asparagus and potatoes were great and they had a champagne sauce that was absolutely awesome... I loved the salmon; it was flaky and delicious!  



I thoroughly enjoyed the Pineapple Martini... Just the right balance of tart and sweet... Phenomenal... 



I was kind of sad that I didn't have enough room left for dessert that night because they all looked like good choices, but alas... No sweets for me... 



The second time, we went through for the lunch buffet... That was some good stuff!  Salad bar with lots of fresh toppings and ample dressing selections... A soup option and eight entrée possibilities made for a great trip through the Villa Antonio catalog... I was not a fan of pesto before I tried this one... The sauce on the linguini was top notch...

It was honestly one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten, and I don't say that easily.  Velvety, rich, tender, and just freaking delicious, served over risotto.  Oh man.  We got a side of spinach to go with it, and a bottle of pinot noir.  We finished off with the mousse (not really my thing, but I was pretty full from dinner).

The atmosphere is great in a quaint sort of way- the live music on weekends, the manager who kisses your hand, the fancy covers on your plates when entrees are served, the slightly dated decor. Maybe that's not your thing, but I found it refreshingly authentic in a city dominated by trendy-chains. The only downside for me was the prices, as they are steep.

Made reservations although it was a Monday night and they were not extremely busy decided it would be a good idea.  Greeted and seated quickly in a booth and server was prompt to get drink orders and give us ""specials"".  Everyone was friendly and made you feel important. Appetizers were good and served quickly.  Entrees were large and very tasty (enough for another meal for each of us and they gladly boxed it for us).  Water glasses were kept full and server was very attentive until it came time to pay our bill and we then had to look for him to get out check .  All in all it was a nice, quiet evening with hubby and leftovers for another night!  Glad we had early reservations as the crowd was picking up as was the noise level by the time we left.

ts46,8/23/2006,revtest3586,3,"Tucked into an unassuming strip mall, you'd be quite likely to pass this place by without even a second look.  Heck - you may drive by without even realizing it's there, or - worse - stopping at the larger cafeteria on the corner of the mall or the family-style restaurant across the street.  Either would be a huge mistake.  Instead, head to the corner and find a nice surprise.



While the decor won't win any awards, and the buffet isn't large, what you will find is a well-stocked selection of tasty entrees on the steam table, surprising desserts (including hand-dipped butter pecan ice cream and pecan pie) and staff that is generally eager to please.  The only downfall is the aforementioned location which can be tough to find, the smallness of the place and that they don't generally pay much attention once you are there - so if you drink a lot (as I do), you may find your glass empty more than once.

There is a lot to be desired at this buffet: paltry vegetable options, meat that's been left sitting too long, lots of brown sauce on everything. 

The shining light is the owner, Tony Nguyen, who (I kid you not) came to my table and serenaded me and my mom completely out of the blue, and actually sat down to talk. Tony is HILARIOUS. He's friends with Queen Latifah--whipped out his cell phone to prove it--writes ballads in his spare time, cracks jokes like an Asian George Lopez, funds an orphanage in Vietnam and sings kinda like Tony Bennett.

The blueberry lemonade, which was $4, was a favorite of my friends. I tend not to like those flavors, but after three beers I enjoyed the contrast.

The location is pretty nice, but watch out for outside seating + summer days. That's going to lead to a loooooooot of mosquito bites. 



Anyways, came here with a bunch of people for restaurant week, and got their 3-course meal deal.



I got their clam chowder, surf & turf and brownie sundae.



The clam chowder was very rich and creamy, with a ton of flavor. Definitely my favorite dish.



The surf & turf was pretty good, though the waitress messed up our orders, and I ended up with medium well instead of medium rare. The steak was tough, but it was very tasty. The lobster was well seasoned and juicy, but the butter was a bit too oily for me. I also really enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes that came on the side.



I didn't try too much of the sundae, since I was extremely full by the time it came to dessert, but from the few bites I've had; it was extremely rich and sweet.  It was probably a bit too heavy for a dessert option, but oh well.



The food was good and the location was ok, so why the 3 stars? Well, our service wasn't the greatest. I realize our waitress was new, but that's no excuse for messed orders and delayed service. One of my friends didn't get her drink until 20 minutes later.

ts47,8/7/2013,revtest3598,3,"The restaurant looks like a converted lakefront house, which offers a fantastic view of the docks in the area (it would have been awesome if it wasn't pouring during half of our meal). Our group of eight sat in the outdoor seating area under the awning, and was able to enjoy the warm weather and the view until the sun set (and the mosquitos started attacking).



As part of the Restaurant Week deal, I ordered the clam chowder, the surf and turf, and the rocky road brownie sundae. 



The clam chowder was super rich and chock full of clams, but it was a little tooooo thick for my liking. Definitely felt a little like drinking gravy - as someone mentioned below. Still, I thought it was super cute that they served the chowder in a mug. Classic!



As for the steak, I ordered it medium well, which got a few weird stares from my dining companions, but I like my meat cooked! The steak did end up being a little too tough and hard to chew, but at least it wasn't bleeding all over the place. Definitely nothing spectacular about the steak here though - I'd suggest ordering some sort of seafood instead. The lobster tail was phenomenal, and totally made up for the mediocrity of the steak. It was well-seasoned and tasted fresh, which, given the restaurant's location in the Midwest, was a nice surprise.



The sundae was served super melted, which made it a lot less appetizing...It was also a little too heavy and too sweet to end the meal with. I ate a portion of the brownie, salvaged what I could of the ice cream, and sat back and waited for the check.



Service was suuperrr slow and I don't think it was because it was only our waitress' first day on the job. The other servers didn't seem particularly accommodating either, and spent a lot of their time joking and messing around with each other. Our waitress gave us each $10 coupons at the end of our meal that we could use another time. I don't know if it was some sort of promotion that they were offering everyone or if it was her way of apologizing for the lackadaisical service. Who knows.



For the $25 price tag, the starter/entree/dessert Restaurant Week combo was a great way to sample the menu. Now that I have though, I don't think I'll be back.",negative

This is not your normal buffet.  It is set up in the bar and booths around the bar.  We were seated in a small room and our server stopped and explained the Buffet and got our drink order.  I ordered a Bloody Mary (more on that later).  We went and got our plates off the booth seat (Really?)  and ordered omelets from the Omelet bar.  There were wonderful.  My wife liked these French fry things that they had.  The French Toast was good as well.  The Prime Rib was too rare for our tastes and the Peel and Eat shrimp was peppery.    Overall the food was good, but I am not sure we would go back for brunch.  Pretty expensive at $26/person.  Back to the Bloody Mary.  I think it had a tablespoon of Celery salt and too much Worcestershire Sauce.  I guess according to the server they make their own Bloody Mary mix.  They can keep it if you ask me.  I would have comped the drink as I informed the server that it was to my liking and I didn't drink that much of it, but that's just me.  I should have returned it.

There is a nice big regular dining area as well as a smaller area in the back meant for parties. In an adjoining valley sits a smattering of video games. There is plenty of variety like the claw vending machine, skee ball, and good old fashion Pac-Man. Keeping the kids entertained here is no chore (with a few spare dollars, that is).



When the pizza arrived I limply grabbed for a tasting. Holy crud, this is GREAT. I actually want another piece! For those of you in the know...it reminds me of Omaha's Godfather's Pizza. Of medium thickness and simply flowing with gooey cheese, I asked for more cheese and peperoni too.

As a Madison-born institution, it always tastes better within city-limits.  After years of living in the Milwaukee area where most of the Rocky's are in mall food courts, this place seems amazing.  A movie theater and game room?  Great place to bring the kids.



Rocky's may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this is THE Madison pizza. I don't care what any critics think.  I very well may be Rocky Rococo's biggest fan.  I fly back to Wisconsin just to eat it.

ts48,6/19/2012,revtest3603,3,"Was in a pinch for lunch today and didn't feel like eating healthy, so I swung over to Rocky's for a slice and some breadsticks.



Arrived promptly at noon, and struggled to find parking.  The lot isn't conducive to a lunch rush (or a large party).  Soda machines are placed too closely to the order/pickup/pay area, so it was crowded and confusing in that area.



Despite the line of people and the congestion, I managed to order a slice of ""Perfect"" (sausage, onion, peppers, mushrooms) with an order of stix.  I paid and had the chow in hand in less than 3 minutes.  Not bad at all.



I filled my drinking cup with some Gold Peak unsweet iced tea and found a table in the center dining area.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the area clean and welcoming.  



The slice of pizza was indeed perfect.  It had been freshly made - if it sat waiting for more than a minute, I'd be surprised.  The stix were also piping hot - another good sign.



Folks, this isn't gourmet, hand-crafted, one-off pizza.  It's cheap, fast, and if you arrive at the right time of day, good.  I had zero complaints with the pizza or stix.  The mushrooms were fresh (not canned), and the peppers and onions appeared to be of solid quality.  There wasn't any excessive grease, and the Italian sausage chunks were flavorful.



For $8, I was pleased with my lunch.  I'm not so sure I'd want to hang out here when the place is full of screaming kids, but during the work week, I'd definitely return.



They also have a small selection of tap beers - reasonably priced at $3.50/pint.

I had a green chile burrito, rice and beans. It was $4.95, it came with chips and salsa too. 



The burrito was plenty big and filled with a great flavored and cooked Green chilie, topped with green sauce and cheese. The cheese was a white type not the cheddar type. YUMMY 



The beans were one of my favorite parts, they were soooo good. Again topped with the white cheese. 



The rice was very good and had a great flavor. 



The chips and salsa we re wonderful, anytime you get free chips is good. They also serve a guacamole type dip with the chips. I do not like regular guac but this was rather tasty.

We tried asking the server how they got their beans to taste so extraordinarily smoky-good, and all she could (or would) tell us was that they used a certain kind of Mexican seasoned oil.

I was assuming when I requested chicken that both items would have chicken on them - something to keep in mind.  The taco was excellent!

The wife and I rarely get to eat out together and decided to go to Canton Dragon via 75th ave. The entire street, from Thomas to Indian School Rd. was closed due to a head on collision that killed 2 people we found out later. Turned around and went to Panda Express armed with 2 coupons for 2 extra free entrees. We were starving by 8pm so we opted to dine in. We got lucky and hit a lull and were able to order immediately. We ordered a little of everything from chow 

mein and honey shrimp ($1.25 extra) to beef and broccoli to walnut chicken. We didn't expect much flavor wise and being hungry we didn't care! The a/c thermostat must have been set on 68 degrees and after waiting to pay, finding a clean table and dodging numerous unsupervised children our food was cold. Total price for this experience was just this side of $20.00 even with coupons and no drink order. This dining experience is true testament that timing is everything! Could have been much worse!

ts53,5/27/2008,revtest3639,5,"Eureka!  I think this is it..  Finally GREAT raw fish in the Phx area. Sushi Kee is a small neighborhood sushi bar with quality fish, portions to wow and prices that make you think twice about stopping by the market on your way home from work.   Use Omega 3  fatty acids as your justification.  The first time you go you will over order if you do your usual checklist.  The slabs of fish are about 6 inches long, more than an inch wide teetering on a bit of rice,  deliciously fresh.   I folded mine like a pizza sandwich and attempted the all in one bite, not a chance.   My favorite this night was the salmon - great fat content with that butter consistency.   If salmon isn't fresh, no amount of wasabe and soy can mask it,  this was perfection.

I loved this place! You are definitely not paying for the ambiance, but I think that actually makes it a better place to go, because the focus is the food, not the location. We arrived shortly after happy hour ended, but with a few pleas and smiles, we were given happy hour rates (with a reminder that next time we would need to pay full price if we were late again). I absolutely love that kind of customer service - especially when I'm the benefactor.



We ordered the Viva Las Vegas, Rainbow, a Hawaiian special, and an other eel roll that I didn't try. We ordered 6 rolls for 4 people and we were all well fed by the end of our dinner.

I could not give Sushi Kee 5 stars because it is not the best sushi I have had. A few Cali spots I have checked out just cannot be beat in my opinion. As far as AZ sushi however, I think Sushi Kee takes the cake. All 4 of us left here completely satisfied. Prices were right. Portions were generous. Atmosphere was comfortable. Fish was fresh.

Their Red Mountain Roll is also enjoyable. It's a pretty small venue, but it's nice for it's size, and worth what you pay.

The octopus sashimi is my favorite!  It is served with paper thin slices of lemon which are the perfect compliment to the octopus.  The Hawaiian roll was amazing! It has a sweet kiwi sauce that is insanely good.  Whether you do rolls or sashimi, you can't go wrong at Sushi Kee.",positive

The food is fresh and full of flavor. Some of my favorites items here are the Baked Green Mussels, Spicy Scallops, Salmon sashimi, and Las Vegas Roll. Prices are really reasonable.

I have been there many times and it hasn't been busy enough to delay service at all. They have a good happy hour and the prices are not to bad. Their sushi is always fresh and I have never had a bad role or cut of fish. 

Their food tastes amazing, the prices are fair and the service is good. Plus the atmosphere gives you that small restaurant feel which tends to be very relaxing.",positive
ts53,12/17/2012,revtest3663,4,"I stopped in here a little after 1pm (they close at 2 and open again in the evening). It's not in the nicest part of Mesa, so I was worried how it would be inside. But it's a nice little hole in the wall. It's clean and the service was friendly.



I ordered the lunch sushi combo (which is 8 pcs sushi, 2 pc shrimp tempura, 2 pc vegetable tempura for $9) and some eel and avocado rolls. When it came out, I was shocked by the amount of fish. For me, I hate when you order sushi and its a giant lump of rice with a tiny sliver of fish on top. These sushi were a small lump of rice with a slab of fish. It's like two pieces of generously sliced sashimi, no kidding. In fact, I just moved half the fish to the rice and ate the other half as sashimi. The fish was fresh and good.



The roll was really good too. It was a little bigger/wider than I normally like. But the flavors were good, and again, lots of eel.



All of that food, plus a bowl of miso, a salad and a mug of green tea cost $18. That's a great value. So yeah, Sushi Kee may not ever win any culinary awards. They presentation isn't as good as what you might find in much more expensive Japanese restaurants. But they are good and a great value. If you want a lot of good sushi without taking out a second mortgage, check out Sushi Kee.",positive
ts53,2/26/2013,revtest3664,4,"My friend and I visited Sushi Kee for the first time last night, having driven by it a thousand times without a second thought given the neighborhood and the simple exterior.  We had seen the good reviews and, wanting something different, decided to give it a try.  At first we were prepared to be disappointed.  When we arrived there was only one waitress working and she was so distracted by a technical issue with the credit card machine that it took us nearly twenty minutes to even get our menus.  The complimentary salad had an interesting dressing but my portion, at least, was nearly 1/3 dressing and utterly overwhelmed the lettuce.  I can also honestly say that I have never had such bland miso soup in my life.  Not an auspicious start to the meal.



Despite the rough beginning, we were very happy to learn that every Sunday, Monday and Tuesday is all-day Happy Hour, for which the entire menu is discounted.  We tried three rolls and two orders of nigiri and our bill was only a little over $40.  The rest of the week, Happy Hour ends at 6:30.  



Our first roll, the name of which escapes me, we only ordered out of curiosity because we had never seen a sushi roll with cheese and this one had tempura shrimp, avocado, cream cheese and mozzarella.  While it was an interesting experience we would definitely not order it again.  It was so heavy and greasy that we really didn't feel like we were even eating sushi.



Everything after that roll, though, was excellent!  The Salmon Skin Roll was perfect and the 9-1-1 Roll was very fresh and tasty.  Unfortunately, there was only one sushi chef and he was clearly in a hurry, as the rolls were not as neat and well-formed as one would hope.  It was clear that presentation was not a priority at Sushi Kee, which detracted some from the meal.



Where the restaurant really shined, though, was the nigiri.  It's been mentioned before, but the nigiri pieces are very big, well priced and fresh.  We initially only ordered tuna and unagi but had to request another order of the unagi because it was just so delicious.  My friend commented that the rice had the best flavor that she could recall at any sushi restaurant that we've visited.  



While Sushi Kee won't score a perfect five stars from us do to the lack of polishing on the edges, we will definitely be back.  We are already planning another visit during one of the Happy Hour days, but this time we will simply stick to the nigiri.",positive

All were delicious!  Lately we have been trying to avoid rice and have been ordering sashimi and other specialties like the Tiger Eye specialty.  Yum.  The sashimi is very reasonable, especially when you order the 27 piece platter.  We did not like the octopus or surf clam (Nothing to do with the restaurant as we have tried both before and not liked it).  So, today when we ordered we asked for a substitute and they agreed, no problem.  Great place!  My husband does not like seafood, so we get him a mongolian beef and everyone is happy.  :-)",positive

I had the ""Mesa"" roll.  The Jalepeno was simply an uncooked piece sliced from a raw, whole Jalepeno.  To hot, too crisp, to wrong.  My friend had the ""Murphy Roll"" which had cream cheese, some yellow thing we could not identify (egg) avacado and crab meat.  The fish was practically non-existant and the roll (although pretty) was generally tasteless.  The shrimp tempura was undercooked.  With no alcohol and only one soft drink our lunch was 29$ which to me is far too expensive for a small restaurant in a bad part of town.  For the same money I could have lunch at RA.

We also had Las Vegas roll that was pretty good. I'm always a big fan of Las Vegas roll it don't matter what sushi place. We also got the Calamari which I think it was kinda over cooked? Texture was kinda rubbery my wife said. The portion was pretty small too compared to Ra sushi that's my opinion.

As far as the pricing it was ok. Happy hour pricing is not a big deal. You save .25-$1 maybe depending what items you're going to get.

The sushi was pretty good, but I'd dock it 1 star because all of the rolls kept falling apart when we tried to pick them up.  I've had large rolls at other places before, but none that fell apart like this.  I'm not sure if it was a sushi construction issue, or a rice quality/cooking issue, but it's a real detractor.

I'd say this place serves some decent grub but they can't make up their mind what kind of restaurant to be. The middle panel of the menu boasts middle eastern lavosh while the right panel advertises Italian and the left panel offers typical sandwiches with a quesadilla thrown in for a twist. It's definitely not a destination restaurant more the kind of place you need when it's scorching outside and you're dying of hunger and thirst...okay, it's not that bad, but why go unless you just happen to stumble into it on your way to someplace else and if that's the case, you wouldn't be reading this review.",negative

They tend to not be very good.  But, I have to say the service was great. Our waitress was so very pleasant, and the steak sandwich on garlic toast I ordered came with a great cut of steak, and a homemade garlic roll that it was served on.

Well, I mostly am inebriated and Z and Dally want to sing. The people that run the jams remind me of the house band at the Dresden in Swingers. There is always this older dude there that insists on playing the bongos along to every song. Even if it doesn't fit. 



Inevitably we sing ""Don't Stop Believin'"", ""Piano Man"", and ""Sweet Caroline"". It will be a group of us guys and it is a good time had by all. One time I worked up the courage to sing a song with my buddy Z that didn't involve everyone at the bar. We did ""Black"" by Pearl Jam. I think it went well. It felt like it did anyway. 



I always have a blast when I am here. Save the time my ex-wife and the girl I was seeing at the time came within about 5 feet of each other. It felt like my head was going to explode.

The one completely redeeming thing about The Grapevine is that the karaoke is pretty awesome. Pretty much everyone back in the pit sings along, so it really becomes like one big group voice ringing out in the night.

When I say regulars, I mean these are the folks that probably would try out for American Idol if they weren't about 30 years too old for the show. Seriously amazing voices and talent, but taking it a little TOO seriously. You know the types. I actually felt a little uncomfortable and out of place until I FINALLY got to since my first song. Our waitress was a total bitch and tried to short change my friend $10. We hadn't had THAT many drinks that we wouldn't have noticed $10 missing on a $3.00 beer. 



Fast forward to about 10:30 or 11. Many drinks have been had at this point and the regulars have thinned out. Crowd is pumped, singing along, dancing on stage and having a great time! The place is packed with people who just want to sing along, dance, and get a little crazy - not try to score a record deal! My type of crowd for sure. 



Moral of the story: If you are a super serious Karaoke starlet that feels you missed out on your record deal, go early, like 5pm and then please leave promply at 10. If you want to go and shake your ass, sing along to every song out there, and have a grand old time, hit it up after 10. Just don't expect to get a seat.",negative

There's also a nice patio for those people looking to get some fresh air or take a break from all the action. The karaoke host doesn't quite stick to the order in which your song request is submitted (some people sang twice before I got my ONE chance).

I've heard the best rendition of RESPECT I will ever hear in my lifetime at The Grapevine.  It was sung by a straight man using a feminine voice and it was so bad it was good.  



My friends sang a Spanish duet that I begged them not to sing and two people actually sang along!?  I thought that shiz was gonna bomb, but I was wrong.  



You will probably be the last to sing if you are not a regular.  That would be me and so I always get screwed.  I end up singing ""I Touch Myself"" to my friends and the only other person in the room who's name hasn't been called.  



If you do get the chance to sing at a peak time, drunk strangers will probably dance behind you on stage, some may even try to come up and sing along with you.  Someone will most certainly play the bongo drums in the corner, and that someone will most definitely not pay attention to the beat.

As I creep around the bar, I discover the backroom - packed with people of all sorts, an energetic DJ lady and various tunes blasting out of the karaoke machine that my grandmother most likely swayed her hips too. Shall I be scared or embrace it? I embrace it and feel oddly at home.



Since I don't have much of a singing voice, I opt for the other option: Liquor. I order the bloody mary, others order the margarita. Both were..meh. And pricy to be honest. The menu was huuuuge...talk about selection! The only thing missing from the menu, since it was all over the place, was Sushi. We order the chuck burger. Solid; as it should be for $7.50.

Be warned that the while the Grapevine itself is spacious with a decently sized second floor deck, the karaoke is inside and it can get very cramped. There are only a handful of tables inside and on a night and especially a weekend night, it will be very crowded and will most likely take a little bit of time to get a drink and sing.

That's what this place was all about. Karaoke. Not ambiance, not food, not drinks (see parenthetical note above) but pure, sing-your-heart-out screeching goodness.



When we arrived it was old school obscure songs by the regulars. People who had made bad decisions in their lives but were still clinging to the microphone of hope. Quite unamused by our crowd, they soon cleared out and we darn near had our own private karaoke room, save for the fellow in the Simpsons t-shirt and the ladies who were hooked on singing and may have walked the streets to find The Grapevine.

You'll be able up select from two books, one by artist & one by song title. The song selection was decent but certainly not the best I've ever seen. The crowd is on average in their 40s-50s but if you're younger it's waaay more fun if you go there with your friends.

It was surreal.

- The KJ joined several songs in accompaniment on the harmonica.

- It's a dive bar with karaoke!

- At one point the bartender was making me a drink and singing a karaoke song herself.



But, the truth is a 5 star rating might not be entirely fair. Because it is dirty and dim (as a dive bar should be). And personally I think they'd rather have their regulars in here than too many new, hipster-y folks indulging in the irony of singing a Salt-n-Pepa song while the older KJ plays along on his harmonica.

That has been the case on NUMEROUS occasions and has always been entertaining. Probably not to the best man who got kicked out of the wedding the night before at the Grapevine, but it was for the rest of us.

The Bads: The songs are rather old. Not a problem because I'm a Karaoke geek and have a flash drive with new stuff on it. They can't use a flash drive. You have to bring a CD!?!? Who carries those? The singers were a balanced mix of singers, non-singers, and drunks trying to mumble something on the mic. If you want to pop out a song or two and you don't know someone there, you may get passed up in the rotation, on occasion. The sound system was outdated and scratchy. 



The Good: You can sing starting at 5. Thats good if you want to hit it right after work. The server, Sarah (I believe), was cool. She brought us plenty of drinks. That's probably  because our party of 4 was hitting the Fireball and Crown like they were the last 2 bottles on earth. The pours were heavy, too, which is great for us, but probably hurts their bottom line. The pour may take me back of I'm in the area, so it could be good in the long run.  



All in all, I would give them a 3.5 if I could, but would label it a dive bar you can get drunk at and sing a song as an afterthought,  not the other way around.

Music selection for karaoke was okay. They didn't have quite as much as I had hoped for. Nearly no Kanye West, and sometimes, white girls just need to rap.



I did however manage to get there around 1:15am and was able to sing a song before they closed at 2.



Another downside was the other patrons. People so drunk that they couldn't handle not getting in the middle of EVERYONE ELSE'S SONGS. It's fine to sing along if you know it, but don't stand there and try to sing into my microphone while I'm doing a duet of ""Mr. Roboto"" with my soulmate. GTFO of my facespace.



A random man, very gay, also tried to get with a male friend of ours who is very straight. My hot blonde best friend eventually sat on his lap and still this gay man did not get the hint.

I guess he was concerned I wasn't a low enough handicapper to play off the blue or black tees which is silly because the course isn't tough from any tee. He also told us to speed up because we had a hole and a half ahead of us but when  we teed off we never saw a group ahead of us and people weren't waiting behind us so he did the typical ranger power trip and ended up disturbing myself and my group by making us speed up when we didn't need to.

I would imagine Tonto Verde's other offering, the Peaks course, is just as good albeit a bit pricier.  



The Ranch was in excellent shape and has matured nicely from the overseed in October.   The course is very straightforward; in fact, I cannot recall a single blind shot.  Fairways were lush and the tee boxes were impeccable.  The greens were in excellent shape and rolled fast but true.  As others have noted, the fairways are wide and very forgiving for the higher handicap golfer.  But don't be fooled:  Strategically placed bunkers can and will wreak havoc on errant shots.  At 7,000 yards from the tips, the course offers a wide variety of long and short par 4s and par 3s and plays for the most part as target golf. 



The service at Tonto Verde was very personable and attentive.  As with most resort courses, the staff does all the work, from placing your bag in the desired cart to cleaning up your clubs after the round.

From the outside there is nothing striking about Sullivan's Pier - it seems that the family took over a previous fast food restaurant?  Inside is decorated with naval/seafaring trinkets from nets, to crabbing traps, to lamps, and anchors.  The tables down the center of the restaurant are also really cool.  The clear table top has sand, shells, and assorted other beach-combing dried things underneath.  It makes for an interesting conversation piece.  The odd thing is that the tables seemed about 9-12 inches too short for the booths they were between.  Not a big deal, but it felt weird.



The Food

I ordered the fish & chips ""special"" with Alaskan White Fish, french fries, and a drink for $5.  The fish and chips were both served hot and crispy, just as they should be, but otherwise it was unremarkable.  The batter was really crunchy, which some may like, but I prefer the ""beer battered"" crispy and airy type of fried fish.  The fish was thin, in my mind too thin for proper fish & chips, if I go back I'll try the cod which should be larger chunks.  The chips were standard fries, nothing out of the ordinary.  There were plenty of sauces to dip your crispy bits in; tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, spicy ketchup, ketchup, malt vinegar, and maybe one or two more.  My daughter wasn't sure about the fried fish, so we ordered her a piece of grilled salmon.  Then she tried my fish and decided she liked it, and proceeded to eat half of it - she's learned well from her mommy.  :)  The salmon was dry and tough - overcooked for sure.  I think it's on the menu for them that don't want fried food, to which I would counter, why are you going to a chipper?



The Bottom Line

The value proposition is there, for $5 you get fish, chips, and a drink, and come away satisfied.  I'm still in search for the same quality of fish & chips I experienced in Ireland ... which I may not find here in AZ.  If you're in the mood for fish & chips, try Sullivan's Pier - it will satisfy the itch - and it's a family run operation so you can feel warm and fuzzy that you're helping keep more money in state.



(edit: I believe they may be using Panko breadcrumbs/batter to fry their fish ... just FYI that it's not a light crispy beer batter type fish)",negative

Since my wife isn't a huge fan of seafood we tend to go to all the places my wife doesn't like when we catch up.  My friend suggested sullivans pier, we used to go there years ago for fish and chips.  The restaurant seems to have moved or opened a new location on Southern Ave.  Nothing much for decor, seems to be a former burger king.  We were both drawn in by the coconut platter.  1 side, 2 HUGE coconut shrimp, and 2 big pieces of coconut whitefish for around $8. we also shared some friend mushrooms.  The shrimp were fairly fresh and tasty, the tropical sauce they server with the paltter is very good.  the fish were crispy and satisfying, and I tend to be a bit of a purist with fish and chips usually just Malt vinegar, and a lemon wedge, occasionally tartar sauce. The last time we had seafood together we went to Red Lobster and were underwhelmed with about the same amount of food except it cost around $60 for two.

There are only two options at this place that are on par with some of the best carne asada or red chicken you'll get from a carniceria. Seeing how the only options are chicken or beef (Or both! Go wild!), it's probably not the best place to bring a leaf eater. They'll be stuck munching on marinated onions, since I'm pretty sure the tortillas and pinto beans have got a lovely amount of lard in them, plus their senses will be assaulted by the delicious smell of succulent, juicy grilled meat. That smell by the way can be detected throughout the strip mall this place is located in, and without a fail gets me salivating whenever I walk by. 



Everything is prepared lightening fast and you can eat in the place or get your food to go. The combos are dirt cheap and delicious, at four bucks for a 1/4 beef or chicken, and seven bucks for the combination of the two. Each combo comes with two torillas, pinto beans, salsa and maninated onions. Half and whole chickens or piles of beef are also available for extremely reasonable prices.

Speed of service is hit or miss, I don't recommend coming here during any kind of football event but most times it is relatively quick. Just sit down and brush up on your spanish with an El Voz or read the College Times.

This is Mexican Barbeque at its purest.  You have two meat options:  chicken or beef.  There's no fancy orange-spiced, or other-spiced flavors here.  They offer two things and those two things are so good.



The chicken was greasy, but you know what?  I didn't care.  



The main attraction was the beef.  It was so good, I didn't want it to end.  It was one of those moments where I hadn't eaten all day, and when I dove it, I was silent.  I wouldn't have answered my phone.



I got the most expensive thing (I think) that they had there and it was like seven dollars.  It came with chicken, beef, onions, tortillas and beans.  The beans are, meh, so-so and the tortillas are perfunctory but the real star is the barbeque, that's what you come for.

BEST Grilled Chicken and Carne Asada EVER!!!



They only serve grilled (beyond marinated) chicken on the bone and carne asada.  Both of which you may order 1/4, 1/2 or the combo with BOTH (all come with corn or flour tortillas)!  Which explains why such greatness that is 5 stars is involved in the concentration on 2 main items.



Now on to the main points:



-Meal will set you back only $4 to $6 bones per person, cash only



-Chicken may be ordered white or dark and is the most flavorful and crispy grilled, ignore the red-dyed skin, it will be the best grilled chicken you have ever had



-Carne Asada is always cooked to perfection, not overcooked or stringy or chewy, always is Carne Asada greatness



-Not only do meals come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, they come with perfectly salted pinto beans (not refried), fresh salsa, and red onions that seems to have been soaked (not pickled) reducing their flavor to a delicious subtle onion instead of a crunchy onion.



-Salsa is a tomatoey, pureed (not over pureed), juicy salsa that screams freshness with every bite.

ts56,11/18/2009,revtest3793,4,"I ate dinner at El Pollo Supremo after reading about the place on Yelp.  I love grilled chicken and this place knows how to grill.  The chicken was lightly spiced and the skin had a red color.  At competing grilled chicken places the chicken is served luke warm, or cool.  This chicken was HOT and juicy.  The meat was tender and separated from the bone easily.  



The beans and tortillas were tasty.  Tortillas were warm and heated on a stove not a microwave.  Yum Yum!



Carne Asada stands for 'grilled meat'.  Usually a skirt steak.  Prepared by a skilled griller (I know griller is not a word but it should be)  the meat is tender, and juicy.  When prepared by an amateur it can be used for shoe leather, or cheap tires.  The griller at El Pollo Supremo is an artist.  Two folks could split a combo dinner easily.  



El Pollo Supremo is in a small strip mall.  Upon entering the restaurant you place your order at the counter and can take a look at the small kitchen where the magic happens.  The place is old.  The fixtures and tables are old.  Nothing wrong with old, it just sort of hard to keep old stuff clean.  The proprietors do a good job of keeping the place neat and clean.    



The reason for only four stars is their drink policy.  They charge for refills.  I can see charging for refills on Horchata but not Pepsi.  It's a minor thing, maybe I'm too cheap!

I've had the pleasure of trying both the steak and chicken. I've also nabbed a taste of the standard sides.



The menu is very simple chicken/beef/combo offered in 1/4 1/2 or whole. All meals come with beans, marinaded onions, house made salsa, warm corn or flour tortillas. They do offer rice and a few other al a carte sides.



The gentlemen manning the grill deserves an award for the magic he performs daily. 



Chicken:

Very Mexican influenced marinade. Heavy on the garlic, black pepper, and citrus. Pair that with the smokiness you get from charbroiling something over a real fire and its as good as your imagining it. They also add an unnatural bright red dye to it. Not sure exactly why they do this but whatever its.. umm.. festive?



Steak:

Delicious grilled carne asada just as it should be. The beef has just enough fat to keep it moist without being greasy.



Salsa:

I don't love it but only because I don't like fresh tomatoes. They puree fresh tomatoes to create the salsa. Everyone who has tried it loves it. Just not something I ever like anywhere.



Beans:

Whole pinto beans. Hard to say if they are home made or canned. I would guess they are probably canned but still good and not overly salty.



Flour Tortillas:

Warm, soft, mmmmm.



Onions:

They are pickled/marinaded which takes away some of the sharpness of the raw onion. Great addition to your hand made burritos.

The combo plate is by far your best choice, giving you the advantage of both their delicious cow and bird meat on the same plate with accoutrements of sauteed red onions, pinto beans, and a uniquely homemade salsa fresca. Your choice of flour or corn tortilla.

I ended up eating the chicken by itself and saved the soft, doughy, warm tortillas for the carne asada. It also came with a side of salsa, onions and pinto beans. The pinto beans were nothing to be shrugged off either, probably some of the best I've ever had.

Tempe Urban Legend: At one point El Pollo Supremo had a fire. The staff of East Side Records (RIP) had to evacuate as well as they shared a wall. As the firefighters arrived, one turned to the other and exclaimed, ""We have to save this place! Their chicken is awesome!"" Don't you want to eat at a place that the Fire Department is desperate to save?



As I was standing around bullshitting outside a friends shop in Tempe one day, a girl in her early twenties was hanging out as well.

SunnyD (he went to ASU so he was into the local flavor) insisted that we come here. I was a bit unsure as  everyone was throwing out suggestions like, hamburgers or italian but he stood staunch in his belief that i would love it.



So, we went solo.



Hmmm...things to note:



It's not fancy.

It's next to a smoke ""accessory"" store 

When we got there, it was a little after the lunch rush and way before dinner time.  it wasn't packed (actually, i think during the time we were there, there  was one guy who was eating, a few people who came in to pick up their to-go orders and maybe a couple or two who were coming in as we were leaving)



It's pretty low-key.

There's a menu. It states exactly what they've got (chicken or steak, i think were the only options)

you get beans, marinated onions and salsa with every order along with your choice of flour/corn tortillas.

I got the 1/4 chicken w/ flour, SunnyD got the 1/2 w/corn.



HOLY MOLY!  once the order arrived at my table, I noticed two things.

1. i don't usually like onions but i love pickled/marinated onions (and that's what they give you, the slightly vinegary yumminess takes the bite out of onions so they are just perfect without having an oniony smell!)

2. they char the skin on the chicken just perfect so there's no layer of fat and it's just all crispy skin goodness with a juicy marinated to the bone goodness when it comes to the meat.



i ate everything. i literally tried to get as much meat off the bones as I could. I like beans but hello....the chicken....was....heavenly.

i could have eaten about another 1/4 (let's be honest, another 1/2 chicken easily)



SunnyD made good on his chicken and ate the whole thing too. I think the next time, we can def. go with a whole chicken and maybe another 1/2. 



It's so good that if SunnyD were to ever ask me to drive out to Tempe from OC to just dine on that chicken again, i would gas up and hit the road.

So-- the FOOD. The chicken is marinated in baby kisses and rainbows before it is mesquite grilled, and I hear the onions are pickled in jalapeno juice and vinegar.

I usually order the combo meal but thought I'd give the all beef a shot.  I love their tortillas and their pico de gallo is just the right amount of spicy for me.  The only thing annoying about this place is that they don't take credit cards.  I have to make a special trip just to the atm before i come here.",positive

I comes out and is red but that is due to the marinade. It is very tasty and juice. I order the 2 piece chicken plate which comes with beans, salsa, 2 tortillas, chicken and marinated onion. Mmmm so good. I have had the carne asada too before but it was a little dry for me but also had great flavor

ts56,12/27/2011,revtest3825,4,"I almost hate to write this review...



But, here I go.



This place is awesome.  I get excited every time I am on my way there and this feeling has never escaped me for the last 8 years or so.  I try to only go once a month.  

I order the combo, beef and chicken grilled over some beautiful neon red coals tended by a real human being.  It must be hot as hell to stand there and grill all day.  I think that is awesome, the coals and the human.

With their dishes you get some decent beans, good salsa, (expletive) awesome pickled onions and your choice of corn or flour tortilla.  For me flour, always.



Now, I have to write this to give them the props they deserve but I want El Pollo Supremo to stay the hole in the wall it has been all these years and stay awesome.

The last thing they need is the Man vs. Food jerk in there stinkin up the place.



If you visit, live, pass by or get lost in Tempe do yourself a favor and look them up.



Oh yeah, it's cash only.  Deal with it.",positive
ts56,1/24/2012,revtest3826,5,"Beef or Chicken. Corn or Flour. Beans, Onions and home-made salsa. Nothing compares to it, and nothing beats it. The chicken is  flavorful, but, I wish I knew what they put on the steak for seasoning, because it happens to be my favorite..



Don't go around 12pm-1pm during the week, they have busy lunch crowds from Chase across the street and lots of local government workers as well.  Be prepared to wait 10 to 15 minutes for the food to be delivered to the table, as it is cooking over a wood fire in the kitchen, YES wood fired meat products!!!



If its broken, don't fix it. If you are looking for something more than what they have to offer, walk out the door, there are plenty of options in and around El Pollo Loco. I like the fact they only take cash or checks. This option does put people off, but hey, at least they aren't beholden to any credit company. 



Now if they only offered bottled Coke.. But HQ next door has them, so no worries.",positive

I ordered the combo (beef and chix) although I'm usually not a fan of beef at these places cause its usually chewy. Well, the chix was delicious. For me, just below the too salty threshold, which is perfect. The same can be said for the beef. And I was impressed with the chew on the beef, it had a nice give too it and was delicious. And the grizzle, yum. Getting back to the salt factor, it winds up being perfectly balanced when you put it into the taco with the onions and salsa. Very impressed!",positive

The carne asada is so good because once again it is grilled! Their salsa is a tomato base salsa and not really spicy but has good flavor. Their tortillas are basically homemade but are from a local tortilleria in Phoenix. The meal comes with beef, chicken, or a combo, beans and onions!

This is my favorite make your own burro type of place that I've been going to since I was little.  Don't expect chimichangas and re-fried beans cause that's not their style. They have a small but satisfying menu consisting of mainly chicken.  



Only downside to this place is that it can get pretty toasty when the fire pit is going and it's the middle of summer.",positive

Their food is simple, inexpensive, cooked traditionally, and very unique.



I almost always order 1/4 chicken and sort of developed a ritual way of eating it:

I take my fork and strip the bits of chicken from the bones.

I take my onions and spread them into the chicken pieces. 

(If the pieces are too big, I break them apart with my hands.)

**Wash your hands first before eating, its more fun to use your hands!**

Finally I take my tortillas, tear off little strips, and use them to make little bites. 

You can take your fork and top of off with some of that delicious salsa.



Each bite has all these flavors, and its really delicious.



The restaurant itself is very small and plain, and almost a tad dingy if you ask me, but not dirty. Its not a place to take someone on a first date, but its a fun and cheap place to go to on a regular basis for some food you'll always crave, and will never change!



P.S. - If you forgot cash, just go to the Circle K right across Ash, and get a drink + cash back. Easiest solution. Oh, and once you become a regular of Pollo Supremo, check out Cartel Coffee (right behind them) - the best coffee spot in Tempe. :)",positive

I had to minus a star for the carne asada because the majority of pieces were too chewy to consume and some slices had fat on the ends. So with that meat eliminated, I moved on to the chicken, which came in a red version and was the highlight of this joint. The two-piece all-white was one breast and one tiny wing, but I thought i was getting two breasts. I could have used that extra big piece of chicken too because my last of the giant three tortillas had nothing to put into it after the tasty first piece didn't last long. Best side dish was probably the marinated onions and the forementioned tortillas. Crispy skin on the chicken also, so I will return for more pollo por favor.",negative

I was expecting to have my mind blown with delicious chicken and carne asada, and while it was good, I didn't think it was as spetacular as others were raving about.



Maybe since we came in here on a Sunday and not during normal lunch hours during a busy lunch work week, maybe the food was sitting out, allowing the chicken to dry out...just perhaps that was the case...but seriously, my chicken was really dry. The carne asada was pretty good and seemed super duper fresh. The beans, tortillas, and pickled onions were all good. Again, the food was okay, but nothing to write home about.

I'm freaking hooked.

 You get two choices people, just TWO. If you can only have two options on your menu, you know it has to be freaking fantastic and it is. They have perfected the grilled bird and I am so grateful I stopped in.

I always get the flour tortillas and put the beans, rice, chicken and salsa in them to make a burrito. The taste is heavenly.

Very simple inside with some booths to sit at and a counter to order your food. Their menu offers Mesquite Grilled Chicken and some delicious Carne Asada Beef. They also have several yummy sides that you can order as well.



There are no fancy this or that items here like some other restaurants. Just very tasty food that is cooked with tender love and care. You can see it in the customer's faces as they arrive for a repeat visit.



Usually order the Combo Plate with a side of Beans and several Jalapenos to get my juices flowing. They make the Salsa in house and it combines nicely with the warm tortillas and the beef and chicken. Saw several people buying whole and half chickens and getting them to go.

However, bring some cash, I don't think they accept cards. 



I'm not a huge meat eater so I usually don't get the chicken and beef combo plate but I do get the next level up on the chicken plate (I think three instead of two pieces, or some such situation) and then I save the bones for when i make chicken stock at home - as they are perfect for it having been wood fire roasted.



The beans here can be a bit on the salty side but love the homemade salsa and the pickled red onions - I generally pull the chicken meat from the bone and wrap it up in a corn tortilla (you can get corn or flour) with the salsa and onions, and it is wonderful! You can eat at the restaurant but many people get the meals to go and take them home, which is how I tend to roll. 



Look, this is not high-class dining but it is a solid example of the beloved hole in the wall and the people behind the counter, always friendly.

ts57,1/12/2008,revtest3892,4,"I feel like I'm being extremely generous with this one.  Luckily for HOT, I had great company which made my overall rating higher than they might deserve.  3.7 stars total - based on the following...



AMBIANCE - 5 stars

In a historic house with both indoor and outdoor seating, this is an amazing atmosphere; better than most of the strip malls that the valley is known for!



SERVICE - 4 stars

The hostess went above and beyond by moving us from an inside table to an outside table by the fire when we had a change of heart and wanted some fresh air.  They also went above and beyond to help me find a parking spot as I didn't want my car to get towed from the lot next door like Patti B. yelped about previously.  Larissa was our server and she was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  There was only one thing that was a bit disappointing when it came to service:  that she came by to take our order and I told her I needed a minute and she said she'd be right back but disappeared for around 10 or 15 minutes.



FOOD - 2.5 stars

Let me explain:  I chose wrong.  Do not order the Seafood Pistou.  Larissa told me that it was a 'messy' dish, but not minding that, I ordered it anyways.  It was not messy, it was just kind of gross.  The seafood didn't taste so fresh and I think the combo of that and the creamy heavy sauce were what gave me a horrible stomach ache that evening.  However, Kristin C. chose right - she had the Ahi Tuna... it was a beautiful presentation and according to Kristin, it was fantastic!  Note to self:  order Ahi if I ever return!  Oh, and I tasted the Asian Pear Salad too - it was tasty.  So, the 2.5 star rating is an average... 



COMPANY - 5 stars!

I'm going to allow the fact that I had a really fun dining companion bring up the average a bit here...



BANG FOR YOUR BUCK- 2 stars

We had only water and perrier to drink and our bill was still kind of high for what I thought was just an ok meal... essentially 1 salad, 2 entrees, and 1 Perrier was over $80 out the door!



I admit that this review is based on just one experience... however, because of the fact that I have no clue when I'll go back, I wanted to review it anyways!  If you go to HOT, go for the ambiance and order the tuna! :)",positive
ts57,1/18/2008,revtest3893,4,"What the....? I've never yelped house of tricks? For shame! Some of the best meals I've ever had in tempe were at this mill ave. legend.

Don't be thrown by the ""mill ave."" portion of my previous statement - it's far enough back from the p.f. chang's, cue clubs and fat tuesdays to keep the college crowd from interrupting your $34 filet with shouts of ""jaegerbombers!"" plus, the price point isn't exactly student-friendly (which is why I rarely get to eat here).



That usually means I come here for special occasion meals like birthdays and promotions, which typically entails a bottle of wine, two entrees, an app and a dessert ($100 for two people, easy). But I have, on occasion, come for happy hour drinks at the outdoor, four-sided bar. The restaurant is made up of two early 20th century homes connected by a large

wooden deck and spacious patio. Most of the seating is outside, so in the hot or cold months take that into consideration. They have two fireplaces and plenty of heat lamps, but in January I still ate with my coat on. Not sure what sort of relief they have in the summer - though it is shaded by a canopy of trees and has plenty of flowers and greenery to keep you cool...ish.



I've never been disappointed in the food. My sister swears their ahi tuna is the best she's ever tasted (she orders it in any restaurant that offers it). and she must not be the only one because they always have it on the menu, which they otherwise change seasonally. I'm a steak girl myself, but the cold weather of my last visit prompted a short rib bourguignonne order, which was fantastic. Two people in our party did opt for the filet mignon served with coconut milk mashed potatoes (wha...??? Yummers!) and lovey-love-loved it.



The service can be spotty... the bar, host and wait staff was a little green for a Saturday night. bartenders were not rude, but... a tad sophomoric for a place that has $80 bottles of wine on the menu. Our hostess was nice enough to move our table closer to the firepit, but never brought the heat lamp she promised. The server seemed to be on his third night of serving ever - forgot an appetizer and was easily confused and in a hurry - probably waiting to get cut so he could head to a kegger. No one on the staff we interacted with was over the age of 20....seems odd for a fancier place like HoT. 



But, for being the only place of this caliber I can think of in all of tempe, I'll take it.",positive

Started with Cheese plate with fresh fruit and french bread

NY Strip and Salmon (2 of us)



Dined outside on the patio for my love's birthday.  Great atmosphere, great food, great service.  Great night.",positive
ts57,3/19/2008,revtest3895,4,"Great ambiance, good food, good times.



As stated, the location and ambiance was outstanding.  Second only to Elements at Sanctuary, but that's hard to top for any city.  Anyway, the outdoor dining is beautiful and well decorated providing nice, romantic ambiance.  It helped that the weather was perfect also.  Lot's of trees make you forget Mill Ave. is just 1 block away.



The wine selection was impressive, even to a n00b wine drinker (luckily our friends are pros).  My friend selected a a bottle with the very helpful and knowledgeable assistance of our waitress.



I can be a real pain in the butt at restaurants because I don't eat wheat or dairy but they were more than accommodating and allowed me to select a meat and then created a dish around my requirements.  Always a nice touch.



Now to the food.  I had the rack of lamb and thought my plate was excellent.  I am by no means a Lamb connoisseur and this was probably the 3rd time I have ever eaten it (don't know why, just always ate cow and fish) and the first time at a nice place but none the less, taste buds don't lie!  It was definitely very good, but I can't say it was fantastic, I just don't have the history to compare it to.  My better half, however, was not impressed.  She had the Ahi Tuna and said it was ""just ok"".  This is why I gave it 4 stars not 5.  Now I never order Ahi Tuna at a nice place because I feel it always tastes the same... in other words it's usually prepared the same the the fish is so pronounced the taste from spot A is never much different than spot B and I always left feeling disappointed and wishing I had ordered something else, especially if I paid a lot of $$ for it...... so I stopped ordering that dish at nice places.



Anyway, I recommend this place, but it is expensive.  For four dinners, a bottle of wine, appetizers, and 2 glasses of wine it was about $350 for 4 people.",positive
ts57,3/21/2008,revtest3896,5,"hThis is an extremely biased review. After all, I've been coming to Tricks for  more than a decade and I've gotten to the point in my life that I gauge the people I may want to spend time with on a little litmus test of my own invention.  I will not divulge what the other items on my test are, just in case you're reading this and want to be my friend.  Or enemy.  Frankly, I don't give a shit.  But if you don't like Tricks, you're out.  The wine tastings, especially the annual Wine Fiesta, are legendary in Phoenix, the bar has more ambience than Tempeans know what to do with and the menu, especially now with the newly cooked up HOT 46 happy hour items, are a gourmand's wet dream.  You can't go wrong with food at Tricks.  



Up until recently, if one was hungry on a Friday night, say around 1030, your choices were limited to Casey Moore's (another fabulous drinkery and eatery but of a different ilk than Tricks), a couple of gas inducing Mexican treats at Taco Bell or any of the other something-Berto's dotted around the valley or delivery from pizza pie people.  A few weeks ago, after lamenting this lack of eats at this time on the weekends, I nursed on my third or fifth Guinness while sitting under the trees (growing up through the bar, right overhead) of this sublime bar.  The bartender, Gavin, a bloke who during the day can also suit you up in the finest garments for any occasion from a bris to a board meeting, slid the HOT 46 menu in front of me.  Served Monday thru Saturday from 4 to 6 PM and on Friday and Saturday from 10 to midnite, this delectable and slight menu will sate the hunger roiling inside your belly.  I tried all six items and found nary a clunker in the bunch. 



Homemade Artisan Grilled Cheese with Roasted Garlic Tomato Basil Soup - much better than your drunken special made at 240 AM, post-bar with neon-yellow American cheese and penicillin-hosting white bread.  It's fine, people, hits the spot perfectly with a stout.



Flatbread Pizza with Homemade Mozzarella, Fresh Tomato Pomodoro and Basil - finally, a fucking pizza that doesn't come out of my ass the next morning in essentially the same form it went in my mouth, all burny and greasy.  A thin crust with dollops of mozzarella that will make you positively renounce your allegiance to lactose intolerance.  Tolerate it, baby, and eat this pizza.



Herb Crusted Mac & Cheese with Southern Fried Drumettes and Smoked Chili Honey - after eating this three cheese delight (gruyere, cheddar and oaxaca) and sucking the marrow from these tiny, cute little drumettes with breading I wanted to kiss, I went home, took my boxes of mac and cheese from the grocery store and summarily shot them.  Bad food needs to be executed.  Good food, like this fine Tricks take on an old standard, needs to be given a medal.



Antipasto of Cerignola Olives, Cured Meats and Artisan Cheeses - this needs no explanation because it is a standard dish, and by that I do not mean to say it isn't exceptional, but you should recognize that a lovely plate like this is simple and comforting during the draining of a nice Malbec.  I will say that the cheeses were fun, the olives divine and the salami, sliced thin, was amazingly mild, not too fatty or salty, and covered in a reduction of the sweetest sauce.  I wanted to put it on my nipples and lift my breasts to my mouth and lick it off.  Oh, wait, I don't have breasts, or prominent nipples, but I know from my time spent licking liquids from the prominent nipples of not-so-prominent women that this sauce would make even a nipple with an unnoticed, protruding stiff hair totally palatable.  Great dish.



Thai Barbecue Grilled Quail Skewers with Fire Roasted Mango and Szechuan Peppercorn - how can you go wrong eating a pheasantly bird from a stick.  This bird, known to move in short bursts, launched itself on to these long skewers just in time for my sixth Guinness and I thought I was playing matchmaker:  quail, meet beer, meet stomach.  Have fun.  Nothing about mango and quail is conceivably related but hoo-boy did this one hit the spot.  The bird melted down my esophagus.  Fuck you, chicken, I've found my poultry.  Now get back to the frozen food aisle and die again in a microwave.



Trio of Green Chile Veal Breast Tacos with Pumpkin Seed Crema, Pico de Gallo and Queso Oaxaca - fine, I ate a little innocent veal.  And it felt so good.  If you just showed a picture of this dish to the veal in his pen, he would gladly continue on his thankless path to the grocery store.  Run a loop of my face in the vealhouse eating this sublime set of tacos and the little softie would smile at how happy he is going to make his human cousins.  Pumpkin is, in my experience, becoming better every year I stomp around this terra firma.  From pumpkin beers to roasted seeds to the standard pie to this Crema - pumpkin is dick.  



So, that's it.  The nicest outside bar I've been to anywhere and my five thousand characters are about to end.  



EAT AT",positive
ts57,4/5/2008,revtest3897,4,"For my inlaws last evening here in the Valley, we went to House of Tricks in Tempe because they wanted to try it based on a recommendation of one of their friends back in Ohio.  The patio area is really pretty and we were lucky to get a table toward the back of the patio because it was a tad more secluded and we had better views of the beautiful flowers in the garden. The only bad thing about the location was there was not a light overhead like other tables on the patio so you had to hold your menu up to the candlelight to read it.



The wine list is quite extensive, but we decided to go simple and had the Columbia Valley Riesling which was crisp and smooth. For appetizers we had the cheese plate and the mushroom flan.  My inlaws loved the flan and said it had good flavor. The cheese plate was delicious...their was blue cheese, brie, and two other cheeses.  All were very nice and there was a nice amount of apples, grapes, and strawberries as well.  For dinner, I had a caesar salad and the scallop appetizer. The salad was a perfect size and the dressing was really nice and had a good garlic kick without being overpowering.  The scallops were fine...not to die for or worth ordering again, but not bad. There was a little broth on the plate that was very tasty. I could have done without the lima beans that accompanied it.



My husband had the sea bass (it comes de-boned for you) which he enjoyed; my father in law had the salmon based on their friend's recommendation which he liked a lot; and my mother in law had the duck which she liked, but she did not enjoy the blackberry vinagrette that came with it.  We tried two desserts, the apple crisp and the triple mousse tower, and both were excellent.  For two appetizers, four meals, two desserts, and 2 bottles of wine, our bill came to $195 before tip.



Our waitress was very nice but service was very slow and not up to par with what you would expect at a place with the level of prices that House of Tricks has.  My other negative about HOT is that it is loud when you sit outside. Between the mosque music, the traffic on the streets around HOT, and some other random noises from the immediate area, it is very distracting and takes away from the atmosphere and sereneness of the restaurant.",positive
ts57,4/14/2008,revtest3898,4,"$34 for five bites of lamb and some grilled taters, and I'm still giving House of Tricks four stars?  Now before you start thinking that the House of Tricks is some sort of adult entertainment and/or casino establishment and the ""services"" I received compensated for the hunger pains in my stomach, I must assure you that if the ""Tricks"" being sold involved immoral behavior my score would be even lower.  (Think negative stars.)  Then again, I don't always knock on a restaurant that endorses gluttony... (unless it's a Cheesecake Factory)



The reasoning behind my 4-star rating for my barely-over-4-bite entree is not because House of Tricks doesn't provide ample portions for its mostly young, attractive patrons, but because I am a fool.  In the spirit of being ""adventurous"" on my spontaneous trip to visit my brother in Phoenix this weekend, I decided that I was going to order a rack of lamb for the first time ever.  Nevermind that the fillet with asiago mashed taters, and hangar steak served with a scallion pancake were calling out to me like the bratty little kids I used to babysit back  in the days when I still had patience.  I wasn't going to be tempted by the assured deliciousness of my cow cut standbys -- especially when our cutie patootie waiter insisted that the rack of lamb and the duck (I'm still on the fence about quacker ingestion) were the standout entrees on the menu.  I shouldn't have trusted his sweet face.  (Later in the evening he spilled what my brothers determined was ""two gulps"" of wine on our table cloth.  Though he did compensate by not charging us for the two desserts we ordered, wasted wine is akin to sin in the Family of H.)  



As soon as our sweet, fumbling waiter placed the plate with four paltry chops o' lamb in front of me, I knew that my fork was going to be performing disappearing acts on sister-in-law's hangar steak by the end of the night.  Each small chop was covered in fat, and while my brother and brother's co-worker insisted that ""the fat makes it good!"" I am not a fat on my meat sort of gal.  I like my cuts lean and trim like my thighs, thank you!  While I did enjoy the five bites I was able to extract from the globules of the lamb's winter padding, and thought the potatoes were excellently prepared, my stomach was left bah bah bahhing in hunger protests.  Fortunately my sister-in-law is the generous, light-eater sort, and graciously offered me two sizable chunks of her delectable hangar steak.  (I might have threatened her with some tricks of the steak-knife-in-the-thigh variety.)



I kid of course.  



Even after inhaling a quarter of my sil's plate, I was still hearing a wee bit of a ""bah"" from my stomach so it was inevitable that dessert would be rearing its nasty little caloric, fat-laden head.  While I hate to be a poster-child for what is wrong with Americans, I ordered the banana white chocolate bread pudding served with pecan ice cream, and proceeded to eat the entire thing myself.  Except for the one bite my brother took of the ice cream for which I charged him one bite of the flourless chocolate cake which, for all you celiacs out there, actually DOES have flour.  House of Tricks -- what kind of tricks are you playing here??  Spilling the wine?  Performing illusions that make me think I will like fat-wrapped meat?  Sneaking flour into the flourless cake?  And still making me sort of love you?



I bet the flowers and trees on the atmospheric patio were really poisonous plants too...  or at the very least, pumping out some sort of happiness toxin that made for a rare moment where I didn't particularly care about the size of the contents in my stomach.



I kid of course. Like Diana H. would ever NOT care about the contents of her stomach! ;)",positive

I have to say it was so hard to chose what I wanted to eat...knowing that it was lunch, I decided not to go with the pasta (zzzzzzzz) and had the Quiche of the Day (Spinach and Mushroom) that came with a regular salad and a fruit salad.  (I felt so healthy...minus the ranch I habitually drown my salad in...)  I even tried Sarah G's salmon...(first time trying it...and I just had salmon tonight...thank goodness House of Tricks was my first try of salmon...)

Why this kind of restaurant/vibe hasn't been exploited ad infinitum here in the valley is pretty taxing on the brain.

The desserts Ive had are also mouthwatering, although they cost almost as much as any of the entrees I've named above. Angel food cake with berries and creme anglaise or the White Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding were both out of this world (see pics)



Service~ seems like a chore to the college pukes who work here, be lucky if you get served at all. 

Most recently I watched our waiter through the window completely ignore us the entire time while he drank wine and chatted with some slob at the bar. 

I have however been waited on properly, maybe suggesting a female server might help. Bad service has always come from the male staff.

~Bring at least $2 in coin for the parking meters

Lunch at Tricks gets five stars, easy. But Tricks has two downsides:



- Closed on Sundays, when I most want to pair my pedicure afternoon with a fancy lunch and pretend I'm a lady.

First quiche was chicken and goat cheese. Wow... That's all I could think to myself. ""Wow, Alicia, this is... wow..."" 



Second trip I had sausage, mushrooms and Gruyere quiche, which I ordered with their daily soup, a lobster squash concoction. While the soup was really, really good, I was still enamored with their quiche.

A lot of places down here in Tempe seem that way to me. For some weird reason or another I feel like I enter the Twilight Zone and the waiters dont seem to have a need for time. Maybe they teach this course at ASU or maybe everyones just stoned, IDK!?!?! 



The soup of the day was some carrot ginger thing with creme it did not taste like carrots at all whatsoever but it was super delicous and I dont even like ginger haha!! Sarah took a pic of the salad I had. I had the best salad EVER!!! Moroccan Fruit and Chicken Shawarma Salad with Mango, Melon, Strawberries, Oranges, Toasted Pine Nuts, Citrus Cous Cous and Baby Field Greens with Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette. I substituted the chicken for some Tombo Ahi it was a few dollars more but OH SOOO WORTH IT!! Abso-fucking-lutely YUM-GASMIC!! The chef here is a fucking genius and I will never have enough of this place.....EVER! Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him to light a fire under your server's ass to get the tables turned around quicker?? 



I will surely bring all out of towner's here for dinner and do more special occasions here in the future. Wine tasting is on Tuesdays I better move closer!! So when are we going?!?!?",positive

ts57,8/29/2008,revtest3916,4,"Being a student, I have to be cheap. But damnit, when you can splurge, it just feels nice. I also uploaded pictures of our entrees.



Boyfriend took me here for my birthday and even though I read it wasn't good, I ordered the Seafood Pistou because it just had a ton of seafood that sounded good (salmon, mussels, clams, tuna, something else I can't remember). You know what this dish needs. SOME CHEAP PASTA. Sounds contradictory for a pricey restaurant with high quality meats, I know, but there was so much garlic pesto in the ""shallow broth"" that I really wanted some pasta to help soak some of that up. It was good, though.



Boyfriend wanted to ""try something new"" and rather than taking a small step from meat and potatoes, he ordered the seared tuna. WTF. I ended up eating the tuna because he didn't like the texture (I thought, duh), but he liked the sesame noodles it came with. He ate them while he drooled over the filet on mashed potatoes at the table next to us. NEVER AGAIN, I told him. :)



The salmon cakes were good and I enjoyed the salad they were served on.

ts57,10/29/2008,revtest3917,4,"House of Tricks is a great place for dinner if you're looking to go out for a special occasion. It's not somewhere I'd go on any given night, seeing as how the bill is about $100 for a dinner for two. 



I appreciated the menu having a good deal of seafood on it, as I don't eat any red meat. We had the scallops as an app. - while the serving was small (as expected), the scallops were the prettiest ones I have ever seen! For dinner I had the ahi tuna - it was WAY bigger than I expected, I couldn't even finish it - but my date didn't hesitate to finish it for me. 



We sat outside as the sun was setting. The atmosphere was pretty much perfect except for one thing. We were seating next to the concrete wall separating the restaurant from the street. If you're sitting at the tables next to the wall, I'd say it comes up to your elbows. Anyway, there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy. 



Our server was a young guy who could have washed his shirt a few times before wearing it again. Otherwise, he was pretty cool - sort of a 'no sense of urgency' kind of server - but we weren't in too much of a hurry anyway.",positive

ts57,1/20/2009,revtest3920,4,"How do I love thee House of Tricks?  Let me count the ways:



1.  The cozy cottage and gorgeous bar area complete with twinkle lights make me forget I am right off of Mill Ave which is a definite plus.



2.  There are plenty of delicious options at lunch and dinner for my non-meat eating friends.



3.  One of the most underrated wine lists in the Valley at a far lower markup than other restaurants of its caliber in the area.  Example, several years ago before Turley blew up and became a trendy wine, I used to enjoy bottles there for $45!!!  Crazy, I know...



4.  Their food is fresh and divine.  Their dinner menu changes seasonally and their creative chef always offers very inventive specials that you wish would be put permanently on the menu.  Some of my favorites are the Ahi tuna and the oh so tender Petite Filet Mignon.



5.  They recently added a Happy Hour!!!!  (Multiple exclamation points because we all know I like the sauce : )  )



6.  House of Tricks became the first restaurant in all of Arizona that my food snob of a mother insists I take her to every time she comes in town to visit.



I have to take one star away (well, really only a half a star if I had my way) because their lunch prices are a bit steep and it upsets me that my wallet prohibits me from eating there as often as I'd like.



If you've never been there, run don't walk.  It is truly a gem in one of the dullest dining parts of the Valley.",positive
ts57,1/22/2009,revtest3921,5,Great spot for outdoor business meal.  Limited vegetarian options.,positive
ts57,2/18/2009,revtest3922,5,"I live in San Diego, but was in Arizona for Valentine's weekend. Through local recommendations, I chose House of Tricks to take a friend for Valentine's lunch...and before I go any further, let me just say that I am SO happy we came here! 



Location--kinda random. Next to the university, and directly next to a mosque and Muslim market. (Turns out market has the world's best hazelnut baklava--go get some!) Once you get closer you can see the cute outdoor tables in the little garden area that conjure up thoughts of a Parisian outdoor cafe. Nice! 



I'll admit, one of the reasons I chose this place was for it's wine menu (glug glug.) They had a special wine of the day, which was great, and pretty reasonable at $6 per glass. 



The food is where this place really shines though...the menu is so interesting, and everything sounds amazing and incredibly fresh. We decided on a goat cheese cake appetizer, served with tapenade, basil, roasted red peppers, and crispy slices of bread--YUM! For an entree I had the grilled slightly spicy calamari, shrimp, and tuna with Israeli cous cous and spinach, and my friend had the phyllo dough wrapped orange roughy with coconut milk and veggies. Both of our dishes were delicious, and we loved the uniqueness of the flavor combinations. For dessert we ordered a bread pudding dish and a tirimisu, with two cappucinos. Our bill was about $80 but we each had 2 glasses of wine, shared an appetizer, each got an entree, and followed it with two desserts and two cappucinos. Not bad for all of that food, if we had just gotten lunch entrees I would consider it a great deal at around $12 per entree.



Service was great, and it was the perfect location for a romantic, lazy lunch on a beautiful day.  My friend was only half-joking when he suggested going back on Sunday....",positive
ts57,2/19/2009,revtest3923,5,"What can I say about HOT that hasn't already been said (in a good way that is)?



This place is amazing.  For those familiar with the east valley, this may help get my point across: This restaurant belongs in Scottsdale as the quality and service are far above anything else you'll find in Tempe.  That said though, I'm glad its' not in Scottsdale.  I appreciate the fact that it's 'hidden' and it's pretty easy to get a table no matter what time of day.



The food is delicious.  HOT is a 5 Star dining establishment.  For their dinners, you'll pay for the quality.  My Girlfriend and I went for her birthday last August, and managed to drop about $100 on just the two of us (without any alcoholic beverages no less).  But it was worth every penny.  I believe I had the Seared/Crusted Ahi, which tasted great (though I learned that I do not like the texture of raw fish).  She had a seafood pasta dish, which I tried, and that was delicious.



If you're interested in trying HOT, I'd recommend going in for lunch.  Their prices are perfectly reasonable (if not down right cheap for what you're getting) and the service and quality is no different than their dinner dining.  If I recall correctly, I had a (filet?) burger that was fantastic; cooked to perfection and seasoned well.  Everyone seems to enjoy their iced tea with the fresh berries (though I could not get into it; I don't like 'stuff' in my drinks).



I've determined that service is a deal-breaker for me wherever I go.  Perhaps that is why I enjoy HOT so much.  We're talking gourmet dining with service to match.  The atmosphere is great on the patio (I have yet to dine indoors there as it's usually gorgeous outside, so why pass up the chance to enjoy the weather).  As much as I don't want to use the words, rustic and quaint come to mind, but the place manages to maintain a certain amount of class and modern-ness, which I enjoy the latter more than the prior.



I have yet to have any beverages from the bar, but I'm sure that based on the quality of their food, the drinks are amazing as well.  They did have a well stocked outdoor bar that I usually see at least a few people sitting at each time I'm there.



If I were a person who ate out more, House of Tricks would definitely be on my 'Visit Often' list as they have a small, but variety-packed menu that constantly changes, fantastic service and a great atmosphere, especially for a warm summer night or a nice spring afternoon.  If you live in the area and haven't been there, you're doing yourself a disservice.  If you're visiting (either from the surrounding area or out of town) I would put this place on your 'must' list to check out.",positive
ts57,3/2/2009,revtest3924,3,"My girlfriend and I went here for a late Valentine's Day dinner (exams and finals interfering with the ""proper"" day).  I'm certainly glad I called ahead because the place was jam-packed when we got there.  We were given the options of being seated inside now, or outside shortly.  We opted for the latter to enjoy the beautiful night air.  The restaurant bar that we waited at was surprisingly crowded too.  I don't know if they were short-staffed that night, but, the fact that it took almost ten minutes to get the bartenders attention was just and indication of the way the night was going to go.  While the drinks (my manhattan and her mojito) were quite good, they were also quite pricey.  Far more than I thought they were worth.  Whatever, right?  It's for Valentines Day.



Well, that just kind of kept going.  My ribeye was.....fine.  Pretty tasty but....well, maybe I'm just not a fan of ribeye.  The soup, a cauliflower-chorizo blend, was good.  Again, just not worth what we ended up paying for it.  Happily, my girlfriend really enjoyed her foie gras stuffed chicken, at least.



All in all, good, but as a dining event, not worth the $100-ish dollars.  The service is pretty good and the location and ambiance can't be beat.  I'll give it another try, but there is quite a queue of places for me to check first before I rush back.",negative

Their outside patio is gorgeous and complete with heaters and a fire pit when the weather is a bit on the chilly side. But the indoors is just as great-cozy little house with a fire place.  



Just yesterday, we had the Mediterranean Platter as a starter (delicious!) and I had the fruit and chicken shwarma salad (so good!) with a lovely glass of pinot noir.

I used to live about 2 miles north and now the only thing I regret is not having gone there more frequently.  For lunch, try their iced tea...very refreshing.  Sandwiches and salads are tasty.

On another note service wasn't that great, but they were in the middle of shift change so take that as you want. 



On a better note the pecan smoked BBQ sandwich was kick-ass, I actually made some BBQ sauce the next day and steeped some pecans in it just see how it would come out since I liked the flavor so much. The potato salad was good besides being a little under seasoned, but to each there own, because you can just add salt to your liking, but I had none on my table and had to go and find some, see previous note. 



They have a good beer selection too. 



So five stars for the food and 3 for the service. 



P.S. my BBQ sauce turned out kick-ass too.",positive

In located in the middle of a desert, the sprawling grove of trees that surround the restaurant definitely make it stand out. The place looks like an eerie pre-civil war cotton plantation... but it's weirdly romantic and nostalgic. 



The food was great! My girlfriend and I attempted to try as much as we could from the menu as our budgets and stomachs would allow. We had: 



1. Perfect Peach - We started with a peach cocktail that had a gin in it. It was a very well made cocktail that definitely had the peach flavor while still reminding you that this was indeed an alcoholic drink - very refreshing in 100+ degree weather. 



2. Summer Salad with Strawberries and Spinach - This salad was great. It came with spinach, cheese, fennel, strawberries, and candied walnuts. It was tied together by a subtle vinaigrette that still allowed the individual components of the salad to shine while still adding a distinct hue to the salad that would otherwise not be there.



3. Foie Gras with Cinnamon Apple Chutney - This was the first sweet foie gras I've ever had and it was amazing. The foie gras had a nice crust without losing the near liquid creaminess in the center. The chutney was sweet in a way that you could taste the ingredients, but be careful to limit the amount eaten with the foie gras because it can easily overpower the flavor of the liver. 



4. Lychee Marinated Duck - As a kid, my only knowledge of duck came in the form of Peking Duck, and damn, this was the most gourmet duck I've ever tried. The sweet and creamy skin and fat of the duck complemented the savory and almost smokey meat so well. The rice was forgettable but the lychee nuts made for a nice dessert. 



5. Porterhouse Lamb - My girlfriend ordered medium but the meat came out medium rare. The cut of meat was far too thick to cook well or evenly and that thick of a cut of meat is hard to enjoy. The meat, however, had great flavor and definitely had a robust lamb taste that a lot of other restaurants can't seem to achieve. The lamb literally melts in your mouth - so tender. The sides were pretty good. The eggplant was excellent - the flesh was soft while the skin provided a chewy texture to complement. 



Overall, great food and it's a pretty intimate setting. The food was great and the portions were the right size and allowed for more than sufficient enjoyment of each dish without being overkill (definitely a nice break from the huge portions typical of restaurants nowadays). The service was excellent, and for a restaurant of this caliber, the food definitely met all of our expectations but didn't exceed them. 



I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area looking for a romantic spot to take a loved one to.",positive

This last time was good.  The wines by the glass are good and the app selection had decent variety.  The short rib app is really good and has a nice kick.  The shrimp/fish cake was dry and marginal so he took it off the bill.  The atmosphere is nice because you can sit outside at the bar, misters, fairly quiet, cool place.  We were there somewhat late and so it seemed that all of the employees were drinking and smoking at the bar.  That was a little annoying.  I get that they are off and want a drink, that's cool.

It is the favored location for entertaining visiting faculty and VIP's from ASU. It is a very popular spot for graduation celebrations so make your reservations well in advance. Parking behind the restaurant will spare you the unpleasant surprise of a parking ticket for those who linger beyond the parking meters 1 hour limit. The serving portions are generous.

ts57,10/10/2009,revtest3937,5,"The Chicken Ballontine is the absolute best chicken meal I have ever had in my entire life.



About a year ago, I first visited Tricks. I was debating between the Chicken Ballontine and the Airplane Chicken. I asked the waiter who replied, ""the Airplane Chicken is a nice meal; it's like a very upscale Thanksgiving dinner and quite delicious."" 



Me: ""And what about the Chicken Ballontine?""



Waiter: ""Um, well, about that. Some people have said it's the best chicken they have ever eaten in their entire lives.""



Me: ""I'll take it.""



The Chicken Ballontine is a simply amazing chicken dish. It comes as chicken stuffed with foie gras and brioche stuffing, coated in a cognac demi glaze, with a light layer of seared caul fat surrounding the chicken to give it a crisp, served over greens (kale, I think) over butternut squash.



The dish is absolutely incredible as the flavors blend together. Everything is in perfect balance in this meal and you will find yourself cursing the gods that chicken has been ruined for you in all other forms. Even at $26, it's that good.



I know ""best chicken you've ever had"" sounded hyperbolic and I thought it was strange for someone to speak *so* highly about a dish. Usually, a waiter will taper their response to make sure they don't look a fool if you dislike it.



This was of no concern to him for good reason.



The chicken was incredible. And then, three weeks later, they switched to their Spring menu, and it was gone. 



Distraught, I emailed them asking if it may come back. They mentioned that it was a possibility, but that chef Kelly Fletcher had been forwarded the email.



He responded saying that while he never brings a dish back in rotation, he would make an exception because of the response he had received to it.



When we visited last night, I made a point of mentioning that I had petitioned for the dish's return. The waitress (who was wonderful in all regards) sent chef Kelly Fletcher out to greet us personally. He came out with a grin and asked how we liked it. I explained that I would likely be doing serious damage to my heart several times over for the next few weeks as he had gotten it just right again.



The dish is very complex--he explained that the demi glace is of course homemade and requires ten+ veal bones, the caul fat is a process in its own right, and getting your hands on enough foie gras to use it in a dish like this can be a challenge, but it's absolutely worth it. 



It really is the best chicken I have ever had.



(And the goat cheese-cinammon-apple-chutney-with-lime-basil-syrup tart was amazing too, and the perfect end to our evening last night.)",positive

Living nearby has given me good opportunities to visit Tricks for lunch and dinner, I've never been disappointed. Lunch is nice for something a bit classier that won't break the bank, their salads are fresh and crisp, the sandwiches are just enough to fill but not weigh you down (at least for me).



For those considering taking their family out for a nice quiet lunch, Tricks is a no worry choice. I've taken my family here on two separate occasions and even the picky Grandfather of the family had something he liked. (He's super hard to please) I would only steer clear on the hottest AZ summer days as the misters can only do so much. Or you could sit inside for some A/C action.



I'll agree that Tricks is a great date destination. It's the first mention when someone asks me where to go in Tempe for a nice date (with Caffe Boa just behind it). The wine list is comprehensive without being daunting and the dinner selections are borderline amazing. I've had several and again, not been disappointed. My favorite has been the Ahi Tuna Wellington, prepared perfectly and with served with nice presentation.

I was craving wine and a cheese plate and a friend said House of Tricks has the best cheese plate she has ever had.  We had a little bit of difficulty finding the place.  I don't know how many times I have been down to Mill Ave in the 12 years I have lived in Arizona (100?) and never knew this great restaurant was tucked on a side street not far away.   The atmosphere at the restaurant is one of my favorite ever.  I love the outdoor seating with the grass, trees and fire pits.  I love the patio bar that is built around the trees growing through it.  I love the year round Christmas lights decorating the bar area.  My husband and I showed up without a reservation on a Friday night.  We were lucky to get the last table in the bar area to sit at.  The cheese plate lived up to my expectations- it was the most beautiful and best tasting cheese plate I have ever had.  The wine menu has an amazing selection of wines in every different price range.  We shared a bottle of Shiraz that ran us $29, I think.  We enjoyed the wine and cheese over a two hour period of conversation and relaxation.  I enjoyed it very much.  Now my husband laughed when the bill came and $50 later he was still starving.

ts57,1/4/2010,revtest3946,4,"I was waiting in the check out line at Basha's and the latest edition of Phoenix Magazine caught my eye with the headline ""21 Best Sandwiches"". Being a huge sandwich lover, I flipped to the article immediately and found that House of Tricks was written up as the best maker of a Reuben (one of my personal favorites). The decision was made then and there that a lunch at this restaurant was necessary. 



When I heard that it was near ASU and called House of Tricks, I assumed this was some casual sandwich shop or divey type of bar; I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was elegant and almost soothing to have a meal there. We sat down for a late Saturday lunch in the courtyard which was surrounded by trees, flowers, brick patio, and a fountain. The menu had something for everyone, but my mind was made up before I walked into the restaurant. 



When my Reuben was placed in front of me I did not waste one moment and quickly began eating. I figured the review was going to be hyped up too much, but I was relieved to find it extremely delicious. Every component of the sandwich was yummy: bread, cheese, sauerkraut, dressing and best of all the corned beef. The potato salad they gave as a side was also great, not too creamy with a good punch of garlic. 



I also tried some of the ham sandwich but I was underwhelmed. After eating half of the Reuben I had high hopes, and the ham sandwich did not live up to my expectations. However, it is close to being fantastic. I personally think it was too sweet, not enough mustard, and too much brie.

I took away major points for the short ribs which were not warm enough, overly fatty and just not very tasty.  Our group also had a beautiful dessert tray with mini eclairs, petit fours, and tarts.  Desserts were good but looked better than they tasted.  Still I would try it again.  Perhaps the ribs are just not their specialty.",negative

HOT is a great afternoon spot.",positive

The rabbit, which was highly recommended by the waitress was just ok.  Atmosphere outside was pleasant and inside was grandma-ish.  Overall a good meal but not sure if I would return.",positive
ts57,2/27/2010,revtest3950,4,"I am putting 4 stars because my lunch was absolutely delicious! I went to lunch yesterday february 26th with a good family friend and I had the roasted chicken sandwich with the pasta salad and he had the Reuben, I think. Sandwich was amazing and I feel the other fellow yelpers were right this place is very tasty :)    However, our service was not up to par AT ALL. He was tall, slender with a dark beard with hints of grey in it..hmm well I was waiting for my guest and ordered a cup of coffee.. so far so good. When my guest finally arrived we waited about 15 minutes until he approached us. He asked what my guest wanted to drink and the minute he said ill just have water and was about to say we are ready to order or waiter was gone. He rushed away, dropped off water and left again! So confused... then when we finally flagged him down he un-enthusiastically recommended some entrees(since we bother have not been there) and that was about it. Not personal at all. No fun! 



Great food, will come back for that but hopefully next time we will have quality service to go along with their quality food!",positive
ts57,2/28/2010,revtest3951,4,"I loved the setting. HOT is located on a fairly busy street, but you would never know it sitting on the patio surrounded by trees. Free parking is available at the meters after 6 pm Monday through Saturday. 



They have a lot of outdoor seating, I actually didn't take a peek inside other than to wash my hands before dinner. The space on the wooden patio outside is cozy (that means that some of tables are pretty close together). We sat right next to the fireplace, but they also have plenty of heat lamps to keep you warm on a chilly night. And the tables are pretty small to keep everything on them (2 water glasses, 2 wine glasses, candle, 2 bread plates, 2 dinner plates, utensils, salt and pepper, flower vase, bread basket, butter). We had to move some stuff to the top edge of the fireplace. 



We were still pretty stuffed from our heavy lunch so we passed on starters and decided to munch on bread and order dinner. The bread was pretty good, but the lemon poppy butter (it changes every night) was amazing. It was so light, sweet and tangy. We expected to get more of it when we asked for more bread and butter, but they just brought out plain butter. Our waitress said they had only make so much because it changes every night, so you have to ask specifically for it their special butter of the night if you want more. Weird that they were already out since it was maybe 7:30 pm. 



For dinner I had the ballotine of chicken stuffed with brioche foie gras stuffing (you get 3 pieces), cognac demi glace, sautéed spinach and butternut squash puree. It was heaven. And all went together perfectly. Mike had the beef tenderloin on horseradish whipped potatoes, sautéed spinach, bacon onion jam and red wine demi glace. Although he ordered it medium it came out almost well done. It was kind of hard to immediately tell the donenss when he cut into the steak (other than the texture) because it is pretty dark outside. The wait staff really should have a small flashlight and wait for you to cut into it so you can tell.  However, they quickly apologized for the mistake and promptly brought out a new plate. Mike said the meat wasn't very flavorful. 



This place can be pretty pricey. For just 2 dinners and 2 glasses of wine, plus tax and tip our bill came out to be just over $90. The atmosphere was nice and the food was good, but I thought it was just a bit overpriced. Heard that lunch is a better deal so I'll have to come back for that.",positive
ts57,3/1/2010,revtest3952,5,"I never think of this place as a last-minute lunch time location but recently when a friend came in from out-of-town, I suggested we dine at House of Tricks. Despite the January afternoon, we sat on their beautiful patio next to the fountain. We were easily accommodated without a reservation during the lunch hour. We enjoyed a lengthy two-hour lunch with an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Needless to say, this review will throw more icing on their cake but the experience was magnificent. From the friendly, nice-looking wait staff and hostess to the interesting food combinations, House of Tricks gives you an intimate dining experience in the heart of Tempe. 



I do wish parking was easier and that the college students with mobile phones growing out of their ears passed by less often. Oh well, it does not matter! I just turned my chair toward the picturesque little house, watched the koi swim passively in the fountain, while feeling the cool breeze through the trees, as though I was casually dining in the French countryside.",positive

It reminded us a bit of our favorite places in California, but unlike Cali, they had nothing in place to deter the many pests flying around. The service was good, our waiter was very knowledgeable about the wine and beer offerings. The food, however, was disappointing. Michael had the albacore tuna, which was sub-par and he ended up dining on half my meal, the chicken sandwich on homemade ciabatta bread. The chicken was flavorful and moist, but the bread tasted like plain straight flour....inedible. The saving grace was dessert. We ordered the espresso bread pudding and it was delicious.

We shared: Fried Fromage Dauphinoise with Homemade Strawberry Preserves, Arugula and Grilled Ciabatta (intimidating name, right?). Think chewy bread with warm brie and strawberry jam. Yeah. Good.



She had: Vegetarian Fall Harvest Lasagna with Four Cheeses, San Marzano Tomatoes and Sage Béchamel. I just had a couple bites (and the mushroom), but her lasagna was fantastic; not mushy-eggplanty like a lot of veggie lasagnes.



I had: Roasted Baby Beets with Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, Toasted Almond Pesto and Verjus Vinaigrette. It was fantastic and filling, with a large portion of cheese. Beets are so trendy right now and it'd hard to prepare them poorly, but these were exceptional. 



We shared: Flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel something. Tasted exactly like it sounds. Rich and tasty and sweet and salty and good with coffee.",positive

A crispy skin that oozes juices as it is pierced with your knife. The stuffing made with brioche and all presented on a puree of fresh butternut squash. OMG! The raspberry iced tea is delightful, as is their wine selection. Sometimes it's nice to find a place in the middle of the city that makes you feel as if you are on vacation.

ts57,4/23/2010,revtest3957,5,"Freakin' awesome. Best apology dinner ever!....just kidding. 

We started with something called ""tombo"" which was seared tuna encrusted with black sesame seeds and black pepper. I am a little squeamish about eating things that have mushy/gushy/floppy textures so I was scared before trying it but it was INCREDIBLE. We engulfed that immediately and only waited briefly before getting our meals. 

Not only were the meals beautifully plated but they blew both of our minds. I believe my boyfriend got the beef tenderloin with horseradish whipped potatoes, sautéed spinach, and bacon onion jam. The jam sounds...terrifying but apparently it was good. I ordered the Tagliatelle pasta with sausage, tomatoes, and goat cheese. Not being a big goat cheese fan unless I'm in Paris, the giant glob of cheese was a little intimidating but easily defeated. I looooove basil so it was a phenomenal recipe. 

I am so impressed with this place. Expensive yes, but you get what you pay for. Not to mention the patio and seating area is gorgeous. As I read in a previous entry--its the type of environment that could be perfect for a proposal or just having drinks with friends.",positive

ts57,5/1/2010,revtest3959,4,"Wow.  ONLY thing that holds me back from giving it five stars was one of the hostesses.  I did not have a reservation, and asked if there would be any availability for a table for one.  Here is the wrong thing to say, which is exactly what she said:  ""Oh, you can just sit at the bar.  Same menu and everything.  It's heated.""  I tried to be kind, which is hard when I'm talking to a dismissive little blond college chick, but I explained that it was the courtyard atmosphere that I wanted - so no, I would not be sitting at the bar, and if no tables were available, I completely understood.  ""We've got a lot of groups tonight... I mean, it would be a long time before a table opened... like twenty minutes.""  I told her that was fine, and that she could find me at the bar when my table was ready.  I hadn't even sipped my wine before she came and got me.



So frustrating that was the start to the experience, because everything else was five-star all the way.  My server was one of the best I've ever experienced:  he was attentive but not in the way, gracious beyond measure - seriously perfect.  The courtyard was beautiful, lit by candles and surrounded by trees so as to be hidden in a patch of Eden.  The cats roaming around were quirky and lent a warmth that such an upscale experience can lack.  From the time I was seated until I left, it was perfect.",positive
ts57,5/2/2010,revtest3960,4,"I've been here twice - once for happy hour and once for dinner.



Happy Hour Review: One of the best happy hour offerings I have seen in the valley, but not a huge $$ value. Great food choices that aren't offered on the standard menu. The hours are very limiting, and you can only sit in the extremely small bar area, so you have to be there early to get in on the HH menu. The artichoke dip and the bruschetta were wonderful!!! 



Dinner Review:

We chose outdoor seating under the beautiful trees near the fireplace. It is such a romantic place for an evening out with the one you love! Our server was fantastic and had great suggestions! The mussels were some of the BEST I ever had - they were served in a wonderfully creamy chorizo sauce w/ yummy toasted bread for dipping. For entrees, we had the ahi wellington and the rabbit. The ahi was a little underwhelming - the presentation was gorgeous, but slightly bland. The wasabi mash fondue was just mashed potatoes with an extremely small smidge of wasabi - nothing really fondue or wasabi about it. The rabbit is one of their house specialties - it was absolutely delish! The only downside to the bunny is that it wasn't cooked until it was falling off the bone, which just isn't acceptable for a place like this. For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake - it was dense and not very ooh or ahh inspiring - I've had better.



My take is that this place is great for ambiance and almost there for food, but something's missing. I expected every plate to be amazing, and was a little let down with the final delivery. I will probably go back again, but it's not my top pick for the money shelled out. I would much rather go back to Chelsae's Kitchen or Cafe Monarch.",positive
ts57,5/2/2010,revtest3961,4,"I just had happy hour here with Ada G. and our friend P before Jesus Christ Superstar and happy hour is great!  The bruschetta is the best thing on the menu!  Rustic bread toasted and covered in goat cheese and heirloom tomatoes.  Yummy!  We also ordered onion dip and homemade potato chips and an artichoke dip-both were also good.  I think there might have even been a fourth dish.  I think wine was $2 off a glass for happy hour.



I was here for dinner a few years ago and unlike Ada G, everything was perfect.  I had the loup de mer that night.  I don't remember what my husband or his coworker had but everything was perfect.  I do remember that for the appetizer we had ahi three way and that was really good too.  



The best part about House of Tricks is their beautiful outdoor dining.  There aren't many places around with such a nice garden area.  It's a nice treat to be able to eat outside under the trees with the little white lights overhead.",positive
ts57,6/12/2010,revtest3962,5,"I absolutely love this place! It's like fine dining without such a stuffy feeling.  I can go here dressed up in heels for a date or in flip flops and jeans for a lunch with friends. I've gotten something different every time and I have yet to be disappointed. I recommend trying whatever the special might be at the time because I've had fantastic luck with them. I've never sat inside but I'm not sure why you would want to because the patio is beautiful! A big tree, fireplace, flowers, and even a little koi pond really make a lovely dining setting. I've heard there are sometimes stray cats around? I haven't ever encountered them yet but I wouldn't mind. Kitties are cute! One of my favorite restaurants ever. If you haven't tried it you really must!",positive

Oh House of Tricks, you are a sneaky devil aren't you? 

Did you know I was coming? Is that why you pulled out all the stops for my visit? Did you know you were flirting with someone who doesn't give 5 stars freely? Is this always how you are, or are you only charming when good company is around? Well if you keep it up, you're going to get hit with 5 stars! 



I have visited House of Tricks three times. The first time I was on a hot date with a couple and a dog (yeah, that's how I roll). We sat out on the bar patio and decided to order a few dishes to share with each other. We started with a cheese plate that was very good and did not lack variety. For the entree I chose the beef tenderloin rare. The other entree that was picked was the vegetarian lasagna. Now, with me being a well known carnivore I will say that I was nervous about a vegetarian dish. We were served a bread basket with butter. Here's one of my pet peeves: Cold bread with cold butter. Never the twain shall meld. One must be warm! Give me a softened butter on cold bread or warm bread with cold butter. Get it? Moving on. 

Our dishes arrived after a short wait. Ah and how beautiful it was! The tenderloin was on a bed of mashed potatoes and greens and tasted wonderful! The meat was perfectly cooked! Now to try the lasagna! Omigosh! What a surprise! The lasagna was so delicious that I almost pushed aside my steak to eat the lasagna...almost. I sat back full and astonished at the great meal I just had! 



The second visit I had was lunch with a coworker. I chose the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak. It came with Asadero cheese stuffed tortillas with roasted Ancho sauce, avocado puree and cilantro rice. Perfection! Absolute perfection! Everything was delicious, flavorful and well executed! I'm not a fan of cilantro and I even enjoyed the rice! The visit was certainly a 5 star visit. 



My third visit was for a dear friend's birthday dinner. I was so excited to go! For an appetizer I chose the foie gras and fig appetizer. It was so decadent. The mixture of savory/salty foie gras with a sweet fig mixture was heavenly! For my main dish I went with the tenderloin on top of a greens mixture and mashed potatoes. Everything was great until I started tasting WAY TOO MUCH salt. I am a salt lover and it turned out that the potatoes were oversalted. I called our servers attention to it and and she brought another dish out with just sauteed greens. It was perfect! 



I adore House of Tricks. Their menu changes with the seasons and there is always something new I want to try on the menu. If it weren't for a couple VERY SMALL issues, I would give them 5 stars in a heart beat! I look forward to visiting the restaurant again VERY soon!",positive
ts57,6/28/2010,revtest3965,5,"My boyfriend and I were visiting Phoenix/Scottsdale for the weekend and I'd read some reviews about House of Tricks so we decided to give it a try! BOY are we ever glad we did! First of all, when you walk up to House of Tricks you just cant get over how cute it is! The courtyard with the twinkling lights, the outdoor bar area, etc. We arrived early to have a drink at the bar and I had the usual glass of wine and my boyfriend tried one of their newer drinks on the menu the Blackberry Gin Lemonade. It was quite tasty, they added Ginger Ale to it, but it was a tad flat, other than that it was a great bar drink. 



We then were seated outside in a quaint little area to ourselves. The only complaint I may have about sitting outside is that it there wasn't much lighting so it was kinda hard to read the menu and see the food. BUT, the FOOD, oh the FOOD it was sooo delicious. We ordered two appetizers the Mussels, which were absolutely to die for. The sauce they were in, the bread for the dipping, the chorizo...oh my! We were in love. We also ordered the Shrimp and Salmon cakes and those were quite tasty as well, but seemed to be over shadowed by the delicious mussels. 



We were pretty full by that point so we decided to split an entree and we ordered the Ling Cod. The waitress was actually excellent and split up the entree for us, so we each received our own plate. Once again we were blown away by the flavor profile. The fish was cook to perfection and the reduction with the fingerling potatoes were sooo delicious. We were ABSOLUTELY stuffed by the end of the meal.



My only complaint I may have about the restaurant is that when we booked the reservation we mentioned that it was a birthday celebration for my boyfriend. Besides the hostess wishing him a happy birthday, nothing else was done for it, so I was a little disappointed and I think he was too in that regard. Other than that, if I lived in the Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe area I would be going there every weekend! I was surprised to see how dead it was on a Friday night though? Maybe because ASU is out for the summer? I'm not sure, but all in all I would recommend anyone visiting or wanting a really great meal to try House of Tricks. We talked about it for the rest of the weekend!",positive

I might suggest changing the name to House of Treats which is exactly what happened to my palette with each bite I took. 



The flavors and combinations were unique and delicious. Everything that everyone in our party ordered was devoured and thoroughly enjoyed. A fine dining experience. I have never had the opportunity to try ricotta black peppercorn grits ~ YUMMY. 



I would love to return on a night when outdoor seating might be more completely enjoyed.

Well, one time I had a piece of a leftover while I was drunk out of my gourd, but that just wasn't the same as actually being there and experiencing the beautiful ambience, having the plate brought to you and getting to pet the fat kitty that lives on the premises.



Right now they're got restaurant week going on and for $30 bucks you can get a gnarly three course meal.  I got:  Coconut curry shrimp, Asian meatballs served over a bed of goat cheese and a dulce de leche cheesecake brownie for dessert with a cup of decaf coffee.



Unfuckingbelievable.



Sometimes when you eat food that is that good, something that soars into that level of greatness, it makes every dish you made that you were oh, so proud of look like a piece of shit.  Did you ever bust your ass and cook something that took all day?  Did you ever make your own turkey stock for gumbo you made and the whole affair took all Sunday and you never even went outside?  I'm sorry, but you're going to be a little depressed after you eat here because it was incredible to an absurd degree.

Got da curry chicken marsala, and it was a good choice.  Good sized portions of nan and rice with the meal. Makes you plump and weak in da knees afterward. The environment is a little too quiet, has a library feel to it, and you feel like the staff is listening to your every word and judging you upon it.

My choice picks were hot carrot chutney (VERY salty and greasy, and I can't recommend it to ANYONE), and palak mutter paneer (spinach, peas, and cheese cubes in a coconut curry sauce).



*(Tamarind is a sweet and sour ingredient used in flavoring Asian entrees and can also be made into a popular candy with many versions- three versions I know of are salty/sour, salty/sweet/sour, and sweet/spicy!).



I don't think I'll be ordering thali dinners here anymore, since the raita and sambar are made with ingredients I'm allergic to.  I would recommend the palak mutter paneer entree, except the serving is pretty small, even for me.  (I like serving sizes that allow me to splurge and still have enough left over for a meal-- I'd say three Goldilocks-portioned servings- you know, not-too-big, not-too-small, just right.)  Another strike against ordering a thali dinner here... dessert consists of ONE piece of gulab jamun!  What a tease!

Over in the serving area I found 3 kinds of soup.  I'm a soup lover, so Pasand was off to a good start.  I had some of two of them, which were both excellent.  Then, though, there was salad dressing but no lettuce.  What's up with that?  There was some fruit, though.



The hot dishes & little snacky things were all good, while the Chicken Makhani & Chicken Tandoori were both exceptional.  In fact, if you're all about Chicken Tandoori, add a Star!  It was warm, moist, tender, & really tasty!



The food here is on the spicy side, & my server, a fellow even older than I am (Can you imagine?) was friendly & attentive.

There are four to choose from, and they are all $4.99.  No joke.  I ordered the chicken curry special (you can choose from all different kinds of chicken curry, so i went with saag), which comes with rice and also your choice of naan or bhatura.  It had a little kick to it, but it was still good.  Even without the specials, the prices are awesome.  My friend got the first-timer special, which comes with a little bit of everything, and it was only $12.  



My friend and I also both ordered samosas, and though they weren't the best I've had, they were still pretty good and definitely filling.  Also, per usual when I go to an Indian restaurant, I ordered the mango lassi, and that was delicious.  Not as creamy as I once preferred it, but I think I might enjoy the not-so-creamy version now.  



The only downer was that the waitstaff never came around to asking how we were doing or refilling our glasses or coming around with a check.  They seemed not so enthused that we were there, so there was a slight feeling of unwelcome-ness, but neither my friend nor I was all THAT concerned.  I thought it was also interesting that there were some boys (possibly owner's children?) playing with a ball and running around on the other side of the restaurant.  I mean, I'm aware that Indian culture is all about the family, so part of me was like, Whatever.  Then again, there was another part of me that was like, Oh that's distracting.  



Regardless, I'll probably go back again when I'm low on cash and need an Indian food quick-fix.



PS: This place also serves some North Indian food.  Yum...",negative
ts58,6/9/2010,revtest3982,4,"Wow, it's been almost a year since I visited Pasand...  better get back over there & see how they're doing.



The first remarkable thing here is that there are at least THREE buffet restaurants right in this center!  ...Peter Piper Pizza (pretty bad), China Town Buffet (a little banged up but good food!  4-Stars), & Pasand here.  Most landlords wouldn't allow more than one buffet-serving tenant at a time.



So let's see how well Pasand holds it's own here, & competes with it's Indian rivals in the area:



Ok, first, the bad...  there's no salad, & barely any dessert!  Fine, so it's 1-Star & we're out of here, right?  Well, just before that let's see if they have any soup.



""Aha!!"", as they say in India(?).  There's Sambar, with pureed lentils, carrot slices, & more, & uh-oh, it's delicious!  Then there's the Rasam, which is tamarind soup, of all things.  It's unusual, it's spicy, & it's good.  Lastly, today anyway, there was Dahl Soup.  This has lentils, spinach, tomato pieces & more, & it was really good, so never mind the salad!



For solid food, you've got your Basmati Rice.  They make it really good here...  buttery with lots of little things in it.  Then today there was Potato Pakora, which is little fried potato pancakes.  Delicious!  Same for the little curly-q Cabbage Pakora goodies.  Their Tandoori Chicken is excellent too, & they keep it moist with a foil cover.  Their Chicken Makhani is very good too.



Lunch Buffet $8.33 including beverage.  They open at 11:30 AM, & they're closed Monday. but whatever other day you're hungry for some delicious Indian food, hop on your elephant (or in your Mahindra) & get over here!



NOTES:



*  Since the food is spicy here, you're kids might have trouble with it.



*  They don't have the full bar you ""always"" see at Indian restaurants, but if you ask, they can whip out some beer & wine!



*  I had this place at 3 Stars, but I find myself craving it & coming back here all the time, so I guess I'm a serious ""fan""!",positive

they are a pretty stand up joint

just your average mom and pop indian restaurant

i honestly cant complain about Pasand, the owners are friendly enough, the food is usually good- if not the freshest its still tasty.

i'd advise going during their lunch hours in order to catch the buffett; earlier the better as the food is at its peak earlier in the day

It wasn't very busy when we arrived, so we were seated right away, and it really has the feel of a ""Mom and Pop"" restaurant. Very nice couple, and a comfortable laid back atmosphere. I'm glad I was with my sister because she knew more about the food than I do (but I'm learning!), and I decided on the curried shrimp, which came with rice and 4 different soups on the side. Sis gave me a bite of her Chicken Biryani, and that was pretty yummy too. SO MUCH FOOD! And it was all delish. I wanted to keep eating even though I was ready to burst.

They have salad dressings on the buffet but no salad , they say its for the naan bread. For dessert they only had the monkey balls and some cubes of watermelon , mind you the monkey balls were good.

Some of the lower-starred reviews below are not at all reflective of this place. The staff are very welcoming a friendly. The food is excellently prepared. The Tandoori Chicken (any anything else from the Tandoor for that matter) is way better than the competition. I'm also a huge fan of their house-made paneer (cheese) curries.

Everything was spicy. I would consider most of it mild, but my poor spouse couldn't eat any of the mains. She was stuck eating Naan dipped in Raita.

The drink was really tasty and my mom loved it! The chicken was good, but it wasn't as good as I have had it other places and it wasn't that spicy. The sauces that came with it were all pretty good. For dessert it came with a little fried donut thing that was sorta chemically tasting...not my fave.

When I ate there, I sat next to the waterfall with the strong man holding the world on his shoulders, it was pretty to look at.  The service was fast and friendly.

It's food that you might find at a typical American cuisine restaurant, so it's nothing to rave about. We had the blue crab dip for an appetizer, which was surprisingly great.

And the lion out front was a cartoony looking lion head with emerald eyes.  Not the grand gold lion that sits on a platform today.  Wow, has it really been that long?

It's hard to mess up anything deep fried and or full of butter....so my food was quite tasty and I did get it rather quickly. After that service pretty much disappeared for me.

ts59,2/22/2010,revtest4029,4,"I'm kind of a sucker for theme restaurants and this place was impressive.  The animatronic critters scattered throughout were pretty cool, but I really enjoyed the storm.  Also, there were fish tanks all over the place and a nice waterfall-type thing with Atlas standing in the middle of it.  Overall, the ambiance of the place was spectacular.

I had clam chowder in a sourdough bowl which was pretty good.  My friend got a burger and fries, which looked good.  The fries were tasty, at least.

The service was decent.  I've had better, but it was at a much more expensive restaurant.  There was a guy wandering around doing magic tricks for the kids, which was neat.

I'd recommend checking this place out, (whether in Vegas or one of their other locations), at least once.  It's just plain fun.",positive
ts59,3/27/2010,revtest4030,3,"We went to Rainforest Cafe because we were in a pinch, time-wise.  We were looking for the least expensive restaurant in the MGM Grand, and this was it!  The food was pretty good, but still pricier than restaurants not located on the Strip.  



My husband and I had a reservation for 8:15 and we got there at 8:17 and they still didn't have a table for us.  We had to wait 10 minutes to get seated (leaving us with only 50 minutes before we had to be seated for Cirque de Soleil).  We ordered right away, and to their credit, the food was brought relatively quickly.  I got the check as SOON as our food arrived to ensure that we could just bolt when we were done eating.  



I had the Avocado Burger, and it was ENORMOUS!  It had avocado, a huge onion ring AND bacon piled on top.  Wow!  I could barely get my mouth around it, and I was only able to eat half of it.  Same went for my husband, who ordered the Blue Mountain burger.  The burgers were very tasty, even if it's impossible to eat the whole thing!  (I really don't want to know the calorie count on THOSE burgers!)  The fries were very good, thin and crispy.  We also shared a chicken quesadilla, which came on pita bread instead of the traditional tortilla - a nice twist but BOY that's a lotta carbs!



If we hadn't been in such a rush, we could have relaxed and enjoyed ourselves more, but we did get to see 2 rainstorms, which are always cool.  The lights go dim, the fake sky glows and thunders, the animatronic animals roar and move around, and water pours from the ceiling into planters that catch the ""rain.""  



Overall, I would say that it is a perfectly fine choice for a tasty dinner and a fun atmosphere.  It is a little too gimmicky for my taste, and the food is a little over-priced for the basic fare it is, but it IS on the Strip, so you will pay a little more for everything.  They do have healthy options such as salads and veggie burgers, so it is possible to eat healthier than we did.  It's a bit noisy, so it's not a romantic, intimate option.  Good for families and parties.  Make a reservation, as it is VERY busy, and service may be a little slow at peak hours.",negative
ts59,3/31/2010,revtest4031,3,"Atmosphere: family and children's place. Nosy and dark. Lots of rainforest decorations. Cool fishes and fake animal decorations.



Food:

guacamole burger- hecka thick meat that i had to take most of it off. I wished there was more guac. The side of coleslaw tasted light and not as flavorful.

regular burger- same as guac burger except no guac.

chicken alfredo- my friend seemed to like it a lot b/c she ate most of it.



Drinks- we ordered 3 drinks, but they are weak as hell. Not worth it if you are looking to be buzzed. My drink even had Bacardi 151,but still nothing. I just felt relaxed and sleepy.

Price was a bit expensive.",negative
ts59,5/2/2010,revtest4032,5,Never had been there before and it was good. we had a nice server and I had a Burger and the burger was HUGE and super yummy. My son enjoyed the atmosphere.,positive
ts59,6/28/2010,revtest4033,3,"I was completely set on giving this place 4 stars until the final few minutes of my experience.  Why?  The only thing truly ""wild"" here is the pricing.



I like the Rainforest Cafe, and have for over 10 years.  But then, I like theme restaurants (I miss thee, Star Trek) because it's goofy and fun to have some crazy atmosphere you normally wouldn't experience in a vast majority of regular dining experiences.  That, and I'm a sucker for their ""Mojo Bones"" (ribs), and their pun name filled alcoholic beverages.



I liked the atmosphere (always love the fish and the rainstorms), the service was polite and friendly and very casual.  Good job all around for our waitress.  The food was good.  Their tomato basil soup is excellent, and I had a pleasant dining experience by their waterfall.  I even had some of my food to go, because it was a respectable (and large) selection of an appetizer, soup, a drink, and my main entree.  For two.



And then the meal came to an end.



This is admittedly where I get ""cheap"".  Rainforest Cafe used to be reasonably priced, and while I noticed the prices were slowly climbing (but still reasonable), the prices were actually uncomfortable this time, so my lady and I tried to be careful in what we ordered.  By the time we got out plus tip, it was over $100+.  For two people.  In a chain restaurant designed primarily for families and children.  We didn't even get dessert.  Thank God, as I may have had to take out a loan.



I honestly don't mind paying that amount of money for one of the exclusive restaurants on the Strip, but those are always intended as ""special occasion"" restaurants that are pre-planned for birthdays or some big event.  I wasn't expecting Rainforest Cafe to gouge me (especially in this economy), and it left a bad taste in my mouth in what was an otherwise good dining experience.



I always enjoyed going to the Rainforest Cafe, and now I'm going to have to second guess doing it anymore.  I'd rather spend the $100+ on a quality steak or sushi from some featured chef in a fancy dining experience where I can dress up and impress the heck out of my lady for being so ""romantic"", than a restaurant you can find in most states around the country, and the standard dress is shorts and flip flops.



When we walked in, I noticed the restaurant was surprisingly empty, and we had zero wait time to get a table.  I thought we had good luck in picking a quiet time.  I'm starting to think that's not the case for our quick seating anymore.  I'd hate to be a family of four.



Unless the restaurant is trying to sabotage itself into a close-down in the near future, it seriously needs to reconsider its pricing structure.",negative
ts59,7/15/2010,revtest4034,4,"I had an absolutely fantastic meal here.  Rasta Pasta was the name and it was awesome.  Only reasons this isn't getting five stars are the not so huge portions, and the smallish booze menu.  Cool atmosphere.",positive
ts59,7/26/2010,revtest4035,3,"I'm a sucker for Rainforest Cafe. This one, especially, because it gave me a chance to escape the tobacco smoke cloud that is Las Vegas.

Yes, it is a bit expensive, but prices are clearly marked on the menu... so I don't understand the shock that people are writing about when they see their bill. 



I like the Rasta Pasta ($17.99) which is grilled chicken, penne, walnut pesto, broccoli, red peppers and spinach tossed in a garlic Alfredo sauce. I usually get the spinach artichoke dip ($7.99) to start, and a one of their brightly colored drinks in a light up cup because I'm secretly 12 years old.",negative

ts59,11/6/2010,revtest4040,3,"Starting with the good .. I was craving the coconut shrimp, so I made a trek down the strip to visit this place. The shrimp was exactly as I remembered. Crisp, tasty, and with the sweet dipping sauce...??...DELICIOUS. But even better than the shrimp was the Tomato Bisque soup. OMG. If I could have licked that bowl, I would have. The soup is quite filling, so I wish I had ordered just the shrimp a la carte instead of the entree, but I can't hate on two really delicious items.



The bad? Look, I know it's Vegas. I know that I shouldn't be surprised when three totally drunk chicks show up to sit at the bar. And I shouldn't be surprised when one of them is wearing a bra for a top and a skirt so short I can not only see her ass cheeks, but the color of her thong up her crack. What I *was* surprised at was that male employees of this establishment weren't even subtle about suddenly needing to be in the general vicinity of the bar to get a look.



Really? Have you never seen a chick's ass before? One waiter actually SAT DOWN at a table of male customers and they all proceeded to stare at the train wreck of drunken, ass-hanging, Snookie-lookalike. That's right. Total double-bagger, butter face.



Oh, and the Magician who was 'working' the restaurant? Yeah. Giving the other male customers high-fives and fist bumps every time she showed her ass? Very professional.

You walk in and the first thing you see is a huge fish tank filled with tropical fish, right above your head...and in a tube that goes around the room.  Then you see anima-tron elephants, apes and other creatures that must be fun for kids, because it's fun for me, and I was 23 at the time in 2003. I may always tell everyone I'm older, but I'm just a kid who never had that childhood and never saw  things in life like this- while growing up.  Late bloomer if you will. 

Garden burger is great here.",positive
ts59,1/7/2011,revtest4043,3,"This place is definitely for people with children. I wasnt quite aware of that when I went. We had seen this place 2x before in CA. (snooty orange county to be exact) but I never really wanted to eat there.. more like I just wanted a mixed drink.  but the place just seemed so tropical and secluded...like a party I wasnt invited to and I wanted to see what the fuss was all about.



To be honest I wasnt impressed. The ambiance is all you're really paying for but they get an extra star for impressing me for about 5 minutes and an extra star for service but 2stars deducted for overpriced food that wasnt that great.  I ordered the Jungle chopped salad, decent, definitely not the worst and not the best salad I ever had. the toppings were adequate but not abundant. My bf ordered a cheeseburger - standard fare (bbq bacon) He said he enjoyed it but wouldnt necessarily come back to order it again. 



If I had it to do over again I'd have gone to another place there in MGM...a place more suited for adults. If I had a child I'd be down to go again. Simple as that.



Note: I did enjoy the lightning show/thunder they had. I did feel like a 5 yr old though gawking at the ceiling..but dont we all when we come to Las Vegas for the 1st time...? Now that I live here its nice every once in a blue moon to feel that way all over again.",negative

It's not BAD, either, you just have to know what you're getting into.



We were there on a recent Saturday evening.  Of all times, we thought this would be an acceptable one for being a bit drunk and a bit rowdy at the rainforest.  It was okay with the staff (kudos to them for not being uptight), but not with a couple of the patrons around us.  There was a portly couple sitting immediately adjacent to our table, and they were VERY serious about their food.  No riffraff tolerated.  Sorry, folks, I can't help that my friend is ""that guy.""  Okay, maybe I could, but I don't want to!



Anyway, I was impressed that the staff didn't bend to the pressure of said portly patrons when they complained that we were too rambunctious.  This is, after all, VEGAS, folks.  Who do you think you're going to run into at a Rainforest cafe in the middle of MGM Grand on a Saturday night?  That's right: drunkards who like animatronic animals.  Get over it.",negative

Since it was a birthday we requested the chocolate lava cake which was pretty good. Now for the bad news. For five people to eat there it was $220 including tip. And that was for only 1 adult beverage. When I say including tip, they automatically at 17% gratuity for ANY size party. Luckily the service was good albeit a little slow.

The thunder and lightning, not to mention the rain by the bar - this place makes money all year round. The appetiser platter is deelish and good enough to be dinner. Portions are not small so come hungry. Enjoy the little gift shop too. People dress casual in cargo shorts and cool t's, jeans and slippers. The steak was perfect. The staff is friendly.

ts59,5/17/2011,revtest4053,3,"Came here as a ""cheaper"" alternative than buffets and fancy schmancy restaurants on the strip without going to a food court.  It was not cheaper. 



We found a coupon in the booklet that we took from the taxi for a free appetizer, so we ordered the quesadillas.  They used pita bread instead of tortilla - great choice!  It was super tasty and a great pair with pita bread.  



We added a clam chowder for $5.99.  It was expensive, but the soup was good.



We also got a rack of ribs (Mojo Bones) that was paired with fries and cole slaw.  We swapped out the cole slaw for veggies, but the veggies tasted a little burnt since it was grilled.  The meat came off the bone easily and it was very flavorful.



We ordered a dish that came with fried shrimp, baked scallops, rice, and mango tilapia.  Do not order this.  The scallops were baked in a plate full of cheese that tasted like nacho cheese.  The texture of the scallops were okay, but definitely did not taste good with nacho cheese (the texture of the cheese was like water!).  The fish had tons of spices in it.  It was only good if you ate each bite with a piece of mango.  The rice and grilled veggies were average.  But at almost 30 bucks for this dish, I'd try something else.



We told the waitress that we had a birthday at our table.  She brought out a sundae that was half melted.  Really?  Are 2 scoops of ice cream (which they would have charged 2.50 for) that expensive to you?  Needless to say, we didn't eat the sundae and let it melt all the way down.  That was lame of them to give us melted ice cream to celebrate a birthday.

I knew he would love the ambiance...turns out I was right. If you go with that in mind then you will have a great time. 



We went on a Tuesday night and luckily we were smart enough to make a reservation (I think there was about an hour wait). We were taken right in and seated next to one of the huge aquariums. My kids were in awe of the fish and the gorilla beating his chest in the corner. Our server came around and we ordered. The service was a bit on the slow side but I observed he was quadruple sat (for those of you who aren't educated in the service industry....quadruple sat means the server was sat 4 times all at once...that's tough for even the most amazing of servers)..so it was absolutely forgivable (been there...done that).

The menu is a decent size. I had the calypso salad which was a really good salad and a huge portion. I'd absolutely order it again. The boy ordered a chicken sandwich that was juicy and flavorful. Fries were fries. Nothing special overall, but a good meal and good portions. Avoid any of their 'fancy drinks. $16.99 for a mojito is highway robbery.

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either. We split the spinach and artichoke dip, which I liked because they actually had chunks of artichoke in it, but the chips served with it were SUPER SALTY, beware!



I ordered the fish and chips, which weren't bad, but lots of batter! I also got the white peach sangria which was delish but super weak, tasted like juice and I got no buzz/asian glow from it whatsoever.



The best thing about Rainforest Cafe is the amazing decor. Tanks filled with exotic fish around the restaurant. The huge mushroom bar in the middle, with the funny stools that make you look like you have an animal butt. Then inside its like you're in an actual rainforest, trees and branches everywhere! There were animatronic animals that moved and even danced to the music. Every now and then the flights would flicker, thunder rumbles, or a meteor shower would happen. If I was 10, this would be THE most awesomest place ever, but since i'm not.. its still pretty coool.



I'd say its a fun place to experience once, or maybe for drinks, wouldn't come back due to a craving for their food...it came out to be about $31 for a drink and fish and chips, good portions.

The best part was watching some patrons get in a fight over god knows what.  C'mon people...this IS, after all, a family establishment.  *sigh*  It was funny, and the stuff quickly removed them, so it's all good.



I do recommend the appetizer that has like 5 different things on it.  I have wedding-brain, so I can't remember the name.  I liked everything except for the ""chimi-cha-chas"".  Mai Tai was delicious.  Pot roast apparently tasted like a TV dinner, according to the husband, so I wouldn't recommend that.  Frankly, who gets pot roast there anyway??  Oh, well.

This wasn't our first choice, we came here out on a limb, because the restaurant we went to needed a reservation in order for us to get a good seat.  Not willing to splurge with the no view seating, we left.  After we overextended ourselves on the strip, we had no option but this, and it was late, so we had to make this our last stop.



The food was surprisingly good, but the service was very very spotty, I got my tomato basil soup with no spoon, lol.  But the good soup saved my chagrin.  The cheese pizza was good also, too big to finish.  The chicken and beef fajita was decent too,  and the burger (with a fancy name) must be passable because it was all eaten.  In the end, the chef saved the day,  so pls give the overworked chef a raise. 



The noise in this restaurant was very high!  It's cute for the first half hour, then it got to be bothersome, and then all I wanted was to get the heck out of there.

The food is decent.  Nothing stood out taste or quality wise so I will not recommend any dish.  Hopefully, you will try something you like.

The decor has a jungle feel with moving toy animals and animal sounds going off at odd times.  It has a very playful look that I wouldn't have thought it was a legit cafe from afar.  Thinking the cafe was more about its foresty antics, I sat down with low expectations.



Service was slow but I didn't mind this time as I was with a good sized group and we enjoyed our conversation.  If I was in a rush, the slowness would've been an issue.



I ordered the chicken & ribs combo.  It arrived and looked dry.  Neither the chicken nor the ribs looked appetizing but I was hungry!  To my surprise, both passed the taste test!  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The ribs, while it looked dry, was tender and fell off the bone.  While my wallet was hurting in Vegas, my tummy was happy this night!

ts59,4/1/2013,revtest4104,4,"4.5 stars.



It's been a long while since we went to this local theme restaurant location (we went to the Downtown Disney location while on vacation this past February)- last went here when we were in the midst of wedding planning (in fact, made the top 2 on our list), in 2005, wow! And this is one of our favorite theme restaurants, which is part of the Landry's family of chain restaurants (Landry's, Claim Jumper, Bubba Gump, Chart House, McCormick & Schmicks, Morton's, Aquarium, She, Golden Nugget, etc.)- so don't forget to use your Landry's Select card to rack up the points. 



Since the walk is a bit of a stretch inside the casino from the parking garage, with construction (the observation areas for the lions were removed some time ago- that was the last time we were in the MGM), plus add the large influx of tourists for Spring Break, we wondered if the wait for lunch would be horrible. But it really wasn't- about 15 minutes. I also figured that there were so many other choices at the MGM, maybe it wouldn't be as crowded (dinner may have been a different story). (BTW, the A rating is posted behind the hostess podium.) We were seated in a quieter section of the restaurant, behind the mushroom-domed bar, and looking outward to the casino-walking traffic. There were five gorillas (animatronics?) in our little nook. And one of them kept changing position and facing my husband at times.  



The atmosphere is pretty much the appeal along with good eats, of course. The jungle theme is a lot of fun. There is a storm every so often. From top to bottom, it is a jungle, through and through. There are colorful birds throughout. There also many aquariums with a good variety and range of bright colorful fish, located in the front and throughout. The servers all wear zoo-like attire/uniform, camel colored pants and button-down collared shirts. The bathrooms are located upstairs, 2nd floor (stairs and elevators- this is where the stroller parking is next to, as well). There is a baby-changing station in the corner of the bathroom, near the handicapped stalls in the back (but not inside the stall).  



The prices are a little higher here. We ended up getting our favorite item here, the sampler appetizer ($18; chimi-cha-chas, spinach artichoke dip with tri-colored chips, cheese sticks, & chicken tenders with guacamole, marinara sauce, & coconut curry sauce- we like to share. My favorite is the chimi-cha-chas (kinda similar to the southwest eggrolls @ Benigans). Everything was delicious, but some of the chips were a bit too salty, just scrape it off, if that happens to you too. My husband especially likes the coconut curry sauce, and we were dipping the tenders into it. And since it was Easter, we did splurge by getting dessert, bananas foster, which was pretty big- but we also shared this, too. (The featured dessert, a lava cake is $14.99- this a popular one.) The bill was a little over $28.00. The wait for our food getting to our table was not bad either. I had to feed the baby, while we were waiting. 



The staff was pretty good as a whole. While in line, there was a lady taking names and party numbers on a list. That's probably why the wait wasn't as long. The hostess greeted us right away; she was giving us an intro as she was seating us but it was hard to hear because of the noise level. The server was nice, and was surprised that we are locals. Guess not many locals visit, maybe because it's inside a casino. He did check on us a few times during our visit. The manager also made his rounds and thanked us for coming down for lunch. 



Afterward, we went to the store, and browsed. I think that there is a promotion for diners, to save 10% off their purchase. Cute stuff for kids.

After a tedious 40 minute wait (make reservations to avoid that) we were seated. Eventually. The hostess was confused and we went for a tour of the restaurant. After winding our way through tables for awhile, she finally stopped and called on her headset for help. A minute later she finally got us to a table. 



I ordered a bacon cheeseburger from fake-happy-waiter. The burger was ordered medium but received well done.  It was an average burger despite being dry.

Unfortunately, we were in London together a few years back and I guess just forgot to go, but hey, there's always time!



Either way, not much to say about this particular location, other than the fact that it might be bussier than the other locations that I have been to (not a surprise, since it's Vegas).  The food is the same here as at the other locations, and I always order the same thing every time I go anyway (I get the rasta pasta, which is penne pasta with broccoli, red peppers, and grilled chicken, with a pesto and pine nut sauce on top).

Thoroughly impressed by the dish as I've had other good eggs benedicts elsewhere but with underwhelming side potatoes.



Service was friendly but food was a bit slow, which wasn't a big deal to me.



Atmosphere is very much catered to families with young kids. They have animatronic elephants and leopards, fake thunder storms (hard to carry a conversation), a well done jungle motif, and neat fish tanks. If it strikes your fancy, take a picture next to the plastic stationary gorilla sitting on the bench.

I ordered the quesadilla appetizer (because I refuse to pay $16 to $19 for pasta or a burger). It was pretty good but I would have liked the salsa or part of it to be a little spicier.

By 6:50 finally we had enough people so guy at podium said we could finally go through to the line. We sat waiting for about 20minutes. I was furious.

The spinach artichoke dip was very tasty! There is also a new specialty menu that has incredible steak and lobster and chicken paillard, both of which were worth the price! The total bill for the four of us was $115 without any alcohol or desserts and two of us had salads. It's a little pricey but has a cool vibe and the food was great!",positive

I will definitely say that during the last three visits my wife and I have gone to the Rainforest we were treated fantastically.  We have never waited for a table.  The staff has been very friendly and the waiters were knowledgeable of the menu and took care of our table on a regular basis.  We love this place for the atmosphere.  The rainforest decorations, animations and sound affects are one of the reasons we like going here.  We have found the food very good and served in a timely manner.  This is NOT a high end restaurant so don't expect it to be.  It is a kid friendly place.",positive
ts59,12/31/2013,revtest4127,4,"Very pleased with our experience here. It was after a long day and the kids were tired. The store (with the animated animals) and the fish tank distracted them while we were in line. 



Once inside, all the action and noise was great for toddlers. They were occupied with pointing out animals, watching the storms, etc., that we were able to tolerate the delay in getting our food.



It did take an extra long time to get our drinks and food. (Waiter told us it was the first night with upstairs open and they were getting used to it). But overall everything tasted great. I tried a Coronarita (margarita with a mini Corona in it) which was surprisingly refreshing. I enjoyed a steak and shrimp combo and the wife had a cobb salad which she was very happy with.



Perfect dinner spot for any family with young kids. Just wish that we had gotten our food sooner, so we could get the kids home to bed.",positive

Rainforest Cafe hasn't changed in nearly 20 years since I first went.  The fake animatronic animals, rolling thunderstorms and such.  It seems to be an appropriate place for maybe Walt Disney World; however, it just wasn't really impressive to me anymore.

the wait to get seated was probably only 20 mins which wasn't too bad (it's Vegas, at the MGM Grand, on a JT Show night). our server was very friendly, quickly explained the different specials and popular items on the menu. she started with a mai tai and i got the mojito and as far as food goes, she got the Taste of the Islands and i ordered the Tribal Salmon. dishes were great given the price!



obviously dining at the Rainforest Cafe that night wasn't a major part of our night, and i'm glad that per the convenient location inside the same hotel as the show, the relatively short wait time (we tried looking around at other places like Wolfgang Puck's or Gordon Ramsey's, but the wait there was in the 40mins - 1hour), the tasty food and drink, it was a great way to start a fun night in Vegas.



*we were even able order one more drink for the road (served in a 'to go' cup) which i was pleased to find out we were allowed to bring with us into the arena past security! that much alcohol would definitely have cost us about $20 each if we were to buy it at the venue (the little 12oz cups w/ generous pours of jameson + gingerale or hennessy + sprite i ordered were about $12 each).

Our server that night was very funny, kinda pushy on the appetizers and booze but I think that's all eateries. We ate here with our 4yo and she loved it. Definitely not worth the price but we did it for the experience for her, being her first time in Vegas and wanting to do kid friendly things.

There was a bit of a wait when we got there - as there was only one person seating people. But the person (or tour guide) seating people, Patty, was very nice and informs you of everything that goes on and everything around you as she walks you to your table.

Our server, Joey, came to our table almost immediately. We had a coupon for a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree. There were four appetizers to choose from, and we decided on the mozzarella sticks. Yum! We ordered (and split) a chicken sandwich as our entree, and I got a strawberry lemonade. The food was surprisingly really good, as I read all the bad reviews during our meal. The service was excellent! Joey was fantastic and friendly, and I would completely recommend him.

I ordered the Volcanic Cobb Salad, and I was just shocked by the size. On the right and left sides of the bowl it was sliced egg, and the salad had a very nice balsamic vinaigrette. My mom had clam chowder (delicious), and my aunt ordered an appetizer for all of us, which had chicken, something with beans which I believe was an egg roll, spinach dip, guacamole, BBQ sauce, ranch, and marinara sauce.

 The environment is very wild and fun, noisy with loud lightning and wildlife sound effects as well as animatronic gorillas and waterfalls.  My favorite part of the decor was the giant mushroom that housed the bar in the middle of the restaurant with the animal barstools and bubble walls.

We had to wait a bit before being seated and the staff seemed cold and short when greeted and seated. Our waitress seemed to warm up and became more friendly when she caught me checking into yelp.  My wife and I both ordered the eggs benedict and a mimosa as usual. The food came out quickly and was hot.  The potatoes that came with the eggs benedict were amazing. However we ordered two mimosas and only one was brought out. My wife also ordered an ice tea and I ordered a tomato juice. We had to ask for straws and my tomato juice had ice in it. I hate that. It waters it down and it tastes like crap. Any good restaurant knows to serve chilled tomato juice in a chilled glass. No ice!   At check out they screwed up the billing and I had to talk to the manager to get it squared away.  Overall we had a good time and my wife loves the atmosphere.

But the fish tank towards the entrance is even bigger than the waterfall - and the fish are beautiful and colorful !!! 

The first experience eating there kinda sucked because of the slow service - but then again, I came on Memorial Day Weekend. Recently, I came to Vegas during the week and I must say the service was perfect! I ordered their eggs Benedict and their freshly blended fruit smoothie- forgive me , I completely forget their names on the menu.

Hubby got a steak that he said was good and cooked to his liking. He seconds my opinion about the sides. Got a Mai tai in a souvenir glass for $16 and $6 refills.

The manager came by to apologize for our refills taking so long, but we hadn't even noticed that it was taking too long. She was also real nice and stayed to chat for a while. 

The only reason this only gets 4 starts and not 5 is due to the rudeness of the girl working in the gift shop. The restaurant had run out of bags and suggested we ask the gift shop for one because we had 3 boxes off leftovers to take with us. When I approached the counter, the girl refused to look up and acknowledge me standing there. Finally I said, ""excuse me"" and asked if she had a bag showing her all my boxes. To which she snapped, ""our bags are for customers"" . I again indicated to the boxes. Her rude response was ""people who buy things in the store"". I then asked if the $100 plus dollars I spent at the restaurant didn't quality me for a bag. To which she said no again. Wow! Were the bags made from gold! ? 

I asked her name and she just pointed to her name tag and rudely went back to doing the same nothing she was doing when I in.

We ordered the blue mountain chicken burger with garlic mashed potatoes $16.99 and the spinach and artichoke dip came free.

Since it was just the two of us ladies we had a good fill for the food.

Spinich and artichoke dip was great, felt like there was a very good balance of chip to dip ratio.

The chicken burger was very flavorful that if you eat that first it makes your mashed potatoes seem bland and not as garlicy haha. 

Still the food was satisfying and of course the decor was enjoyable especially during the 'rainy' parts.

For what we paid I think the food was great and went above expectations. Yes I eat out at $$$$ restaurants, but I pay for that kind of food. For food that is average pricing, I was expecting average, but thankfully it was above that.",positive
ts59,9/22/2014,revtest4157,4,"I wanted to update my review for one reason, most of the reviews that are negative do so because of price. I want to clarify that if you are looking for a place where the food is just as valuable as the price don't come here. It is expensive.

It's a great place to bring kids or large parties. There is a thunder storm inside the restaurant every 30 minutes. The animals move and make noises when you least expect it. There are many large fish tanks with lots of cool fish. 



Overall, it's your traditional ""American"" food items that are predictable and taste good. But that's not why you would choose to eat here. It's an ""experience"" that is worth trying out.

Not only was he patient and friendly but he has tons of fun facts about Vegas and was a really stellar server. I love that he understands the value of giving good service and working for his tips with a smile! he never once made me feel like a burden even when I was being a pain because my children ordered these ICEES that kept getting jammed up in their $10 fancy cups.. if you can AVOID those cups I recommend it but my kids did love them lol.. Now on to my review  

So I am a Vegas Local of almost two years now and this is my first time trying the Rainforest Café at MGM. All my prior experiences were at the San Francisco location.  Let me just say I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth this place runs considering how busy it can get.  We decided to go here to celebrate my son's fifth birthday. This is a great restaurant for children because they have all the amazing animals and thunderstorms.    When we arrived it was a pretty decent wait so we decided to join the Landry's Select Club . Now I know what you're thinking? paying to get priority seating? well you BETCHA and it was worth every penny. Basically I paid $25 to get the rewards card that is good at various restaurants Claim Jumper and Bubba Gump Shrimp to name a few of the other Vegas locations but with that intial fee you get a $25 credit towards your next meal but if youre savvy just download the App directly to your phone and register your card and boom you can save it instantly. Which I think is amazing because this place isn't CHEAP. That is why I am only giving it four stars... As much as I would love to give it five for the quality of food it just isn't a five star joint but my kids had a blast!   That club has a lot of other perks like a credit on your birthday and discounts on merchandise so if you're a big fan of dining out it is worth looking into. Now as far as the food goes I got this shrimp Jambalaya pasta that was really spicy but pretty delicious and I tried a bit of my Mom's Chinese chicken salad. They give HUGE portions so come prepared to EAT or get a doggie bag to take home. My kids were able to get these giant Icees and yummy food they both devoured so overall it was a good time. The view is great and the fish tanks and thunderstorm are fun. If you're looking for a child friendly place to enjoy some food while in town or even celebrating a special occasion definitely check this place out! When we mentioned it was my son's bday he got a cupcake free of charge and they sang to him it was his best bday Ever...  

Another quick tip is look around for coupons in the tourist books that may help with some $",positive
ts59,12/20/2014,revtest4166,4,"The Rainforest Cafe was a fun dining experiencing.  It's set up like a rain forest and even has thunder and lighting.  There is an aquarium and many animated animals.  We were expecting a cafe sized meal, but they are actually more like a restaurant.  We went there since we had a coupon for a free appetizer and used it on some quesadillas.  They were delicious and were a pretty large portion.  We should have ordered just that and one entree to share.  Instead, my boyfriend and I had two separate entrees and didn't finish either.  He got a pasta dish and I got a shrimp salad.  The salad was yummy with mangoes and strawberries.  It still remained yummy hours later (which was pretty impressive), except for the fact that a lot of the juice dripped out and got all over the box and bag.

It is great for families with children, but other than that, your money would be better spent elsewhere in MGM Grand or on the Strip.



The food was mediocre.  For the appetizer, we had the mozzarella sticks, which were not thoroughly cooked.  Not much on the menu sounded appealing, so I got a bacon burger with mushrooms, while my friends got an avocado burger and the rasta pasta.  We all agreed that its as nothing special, especially for the price.  For dessert we had the Sparkling Volcano!  It was a really fun dish, but you definitely need at least 3 people actively eating this dessert to finish it!

They have had their ""Tuesday Taco Night"" for years but recently added to it which makes me super happy.

You can also on Thursday nights get 3 ""Grilled Chicken Tacos"" for $2.09.

I was all over that. I change it up from time to time and get it either double wrapped, or all beef no beans, maybe some extra red AND green sauce, it just depends on my mood. The macho combo burrito is filling and not intended for the weak. My wife has a hard enough time finishing a half pound burrito and usually just sticks to the value bean and cheese burrito for only .50 cents. It was Tuesday taco night so I got 6 soft tacos (3 no lettuce for the fur-baby) as well. taco night is every Tuesday from 3pm - 11pm and regular tacos are 3 for $1.09 or you can upgrade to 3 classic tacos for a $1 more. My tacos were as good as always. I also tried this new crunchtada tostada. It tastes like the tostada they already have on the menu, but you can get it with beef or chicken if you don't just want beans, cheese and sauce. The crunchtada was just ok.

Each item of your order is repeated back to you as you order, with MANY pauses in between, as well as repeated in its entirety again at the end. It is so slow that they actually sound rather incompetent. So much time is wasted placing your order, that when you drive around to the pick up window they immediatley hand you the order and ask for payment. This sounds great, but they don't even give you a chance to put your car in park, or gather your money in order to pay.

There are similarities between Taco Bell and Del Taco but I think Del Taco wins- more variety is the key. I don't like the bland tortilla chips, though- gotta give that to Taco Bell. Don't like the cheese sauce, either, so Taco Bell wins the nachos battle. 



The real winner are the tacos. I love the shrimp and fish tacos- flavorful with a mix of textures to make them interesting. Those soft corn tortillas are the bomb.

Does it match what's happening in other places I've lived in terms of innovation, atmosphere, etc.?  Hell no.  But the food is great, and the people know us and treat us very well.  You come regularly, you're never going to get turned over or feel like a ""cover"" (whatever the heck that is) - like you absolutely will at some point if you dine on the strip.  



I have to admit that it took me awhile to understand the pricing after some initial sticker shock.  It comes down to the fact that Vegas ain't cheap and there is a dearth of competition in the local dining scene.  After several years here and with Vegas treating me much better financially, I don't even think about it.  Just pay the bill and know that you're supporting one of literally just a handful of white tablecloth local establishments that's even worth visiting in this inhospitable wasteland we call ""home.""

  Staying at the Flamingo, I remebered seeing this Japanese joint right next door in Bally's (located in the back where the sportsbook/pool/monorail is).



  They have a great Bento lunch set (3 types) all around $9-12 which is a cheap lunch for Vegas that isn't McDonalds/Quiznos. Their beer prices aren't too bad compared to most restaurants in the area (around $4, compared to the $6 in other places). We had a big group so we ordered almost 1 of everything on the menu, so I got to try out a lot of what they had to offer.  The sushi, chicken teriyaki, soba, udon, tempura, and salad were not the best i've had. However, they were still of good quality, came out quick, our service was friendly, and the food was delicious...and yes we were all sober at that time...so we could make good judgement.  By the way their fried Squid which came out looking like Katsu was delicious too.  

  If you're around the area (considering I wouldn't go too out of my way to get here if I was somewhere like Mandalay or Treasure Island), and like us just not craving the typical burger fries/pizza...this excellently priced delicious Japanese food is definitely worth a stop.

On game day, this place gets very loud, so if you are looking for a quiet place to eat, make sure it is not March Madness or the Super Bowl.



The place is fairly small with counter service for about 12 and about 10 tables.  They could probably put together a group of 8 or so, but I would not recommend attempting this.



The place usually has one or two Japanese speakers if in case that is some sort of necessity here.



It is a bit pricey for the quality of food.  $15 or so for most dinners such as pike mackeral or pork cutlet.  If you want to go cheap, you can get the bowls or eat here for lunch specials.  I have never bothered with their sushi or tempura.  I don't recommend you do so unless you aren't very picky.



Anyhoo, at least they ask whether or not you want your miso soup before the meal or with it.  In case such things are important for you to know, miso soup is supposed to be served with the meal.  Personally, I don't care one way or the other, but it is a good check point for if you are an authenticity nut.

The signs and menus all had both English and Japanese.  That's usually a good sign, it means they expect to serve people from Japan who know what how Japanese food should taste.  It also usually means the staff speaks Japanese, so I can get in a bit of practice ordering in Japanese.



I decided to go with a ""bento"" box lunch special.  I like ""bento"", because it is the traditional Japanese lunch, and I get to try little tastes of different things.  In this case, the bento came with miso soup, rice, salad, vegetable and shrimp tempura, and chicken terriyaki.  All were very good.  I was impressed by the quality of the chicken meat, and how light the terriyaki sause was (instead of the usual heavy, sticky, syrupy terriyaki).  I topped it off with a cold Sapporo beer.  A very satisfying lunch.



The staff was also very nice, greeting us with the traditional ""Irrashai!"".  My wife is not very experienced with chopsticks, and the waitress provided her a set of ""chopstick helpers"" to make it easier for her to eat.  She tolerated my ordering in Japanese without any problems.  And she quickly provided my wife with an extra helping of terriyaki sauce when asked.



I only had a few minor complaints.  Our waitress was occassionally busy doing other tasks and sometimes took a while to check on us.  And the menu was a bit more limited than some places.

We basically came here because it was close by to the hotel and it was relatively cheap. There is certainly much better sushi to be had in Vegas and there is certainly much better AND more expensive sushi to be had. We wanted to keep things easy and cheap. 



They have a good selection and all the usual suspects are present. Didn't see any particularly unusual or creative things on the menu but you've got your spicy tuna, salmon skin, rainbow rolls and all the rest. The fish was pretty fresh and it was presently nicely but it just lacked a ""Wow this is so delicious"" factor. Salmon skin was a little fishy and the spicy tuna a little chewy and not as spicy as I would like. 



I do think it's an OK value if you are lazy and cheap and in the area but I wouldn't make any specific plans on coming here as it wasn't that good. Next time I would probably make the effort to go somewhere with better quality food for similar prices (even if it means not being so lazy and actually getting into a cab).",negative

We were seated and attended to quickly. Our waitress was really nice, always made sure we had what we needed. We ordered a philly roll, crunch roll, and a couple pieces of octopus. Everything was really good and made well.  Sushi came out quick, but not so quick you are wondering if its fresh. Sapporo's were nice and cold. A nice touch was they brought us a hot cup of green tea at the end of our meal.



I think they may suffer from being in such an odd area. We would definitely come back if we made it that far into Bally's again and were craving sushi.",negative

The main point I wanted to drop about Ichiban is that they have a phenomenal server named Pen. She is one of the sweetest, most genuinely kind people I've ever seen in this role. 



Friendly right from the get go. She kept coming back, answering questions, checking on things for us. She brought us a sample of a unique type of potato we had never heard of, cut fresh by the chef just because we seemed curious. I learned a few things that day, about huge rice balls and the fact that I do not like that potato.. 



Anyway, the food was solid. We had just rolled into town and needed food ""stat"" as the doctor would say. I would have said 3 stars because the meal did what it was supposed to; filled us up and didn't cost an arm and a leg, but Pen's service jumped it up another one just by being great.

For service quality(speed of meal preparation), I give 2 stars but food quality compensates (being nice here I am....) as well as staff member being apologetic for slow kitchen service (it's not their fault) so 3 stars.

The food isn't really much to brag about, just your usual Japanese Food selections, sushi, donburi, and bento boxes.  I picked up the Chicken Teriyaki on rice.  Considering that during that trip all I've had were buffets, burgers, and sweets, it was a nice change of pace and very welcoming.

This place hides in the corner of Bally's basement near the monorail entrance, and manages to achieve something like an oasis of Zen-like calm despite being in the basement of a casino. It is NOT a casino-owned restaurant, so you won't get comped - but you won't be paying prices inflated by comping, either. It isn't huge, so don't bring a huge gang of people, but a medium-size party could fit fine. There's sushi bar seating and tables. 



I've been here twice now. Each time, the place was largely full of actual Japanese people, either locals or tourists. Last time, one of the principal dancers from Bally's big show was there with some friends, and obviously liked the place (especially since she could surely get comped elsewhere). 



The food is average to good - and that's by my snobby San Francisco Japantown standards. I've had better Japanese in Vegas, for three times the price, but nothing in this range - which is why it gets four stars. Certainly way better than Todai or any of the buffet sushi!

ts65,4/17/2011,revtest4235,4,"Ichiban Sushi is a comfortable casual place in the rear of Bally's on the way to the monorail station. I found this place 5 years ago while attending a trade show. I decided to try Ichiban as I noticed that most of the patrons visiting that week were Japanese nationals away from home wanting Japanese cooking. I have dinner here at least twice for my once a year visit while I'm in Vegas for the week. Ichiban is perfect after spending a whole day on the convention floor. The atmosphere is lively but tame enough  to have a conversation should you wish to have friends join you for dinner. 



I found that I liked Ichiban because of the variety of ala-carte items, and many items that you won't find in the high priced/high end sushi places that are plentyful in Las Vegas. The appetizer list is long so you won't run out of items to try. I rate the sushi as good, but not in the high end of excellent. Don't get me wrong, the sushi is still very tasty, fresh, and delicious. 



I ordered everything ala-carte, starting with sake and a beer chaser. Meanwhile an order of sushi consisting of, mackerel, tuna, unagi, and halibut await. The sushi order took longer than expected, so don't be in a hurry if you order sushi. There are two chefs handling all of the sushi orders. As an appetizer I ordered nato tofu or hiyayako tofu. On one night I had chicken udon and the next night I had broiled black cod and some pickled vegetables. Both items came with miso soup which was excellent. The oyako domburi is also good dish to order. All dinners finished with green tea. 



I feel that many of the dishes served can be described as Japanese comfort food; overall a delicious and satisfying experience. Both waitresses Pen and Midori were very attentive, personable, and took care of my dining needs. Ichiban is open on some nights until 11:00PM which is great since I like to eat late after 9:00 PM.",positive

Their spicy scallop is mind blogging!!!it is perfection. the sauce is to die for!! not any typical sauce!!

I flew in from New York for a trade show and entered around 7:30PM--not a soul to be seen.  Was super-worried but not long after I ordered my food, the place was packed--with mostly Japanese regulars who seemed to know the employees/owners.  



I normally scarf two-roll lunch-specials with miso soup and remain hungry.  I ordered two rolls and a soup and my god--I LEFT FOOD ON THE TABLE.  The rice was fresh, pillowy and soft and the fish was fresh.  About half the clientele ordered soba or udon noodles.  They must be good here, too.",positive

i will say although i was fine with the food, i was surprised at the place itself. it is small....like 6 tables small. however...if your dinner patrons are all of the same ethnicity as the place itself, and the only language being spoken in the restaurant is that ethnicity, i feel like it might be pretty authentic. please don't judge, but based on that, i assume this place might be quite the real deal. alas, my japanese cultural experience is limited to an airport in tokyo, so forgive me.

Their seafood salad - $16.50 for about 7 pieces of fresh sashimi, imitation crab, ebi, tomatoes, avocado, cucumbers, seaweed salad and greens and a ginger miso dressing. Totally healthy and totally yummy! 



My absolute favorite: jubilee roll. Take a look at my pictures, soo much fish in that roll! It's delicious!! :) their Agedashi tofu is good too.

ts65,1/10/2014,revtest4289,5,"Probably the best (and perhaps only) ""no frills"" Japanese restaurant you can find on The Strip. By the time you're reading this they might have already moved into their renovated location (exciting!), but if not they're still temporarily in a converted conference room at the end of the corridor leading to the monorail/pool underneath Bally's. This works in your favor for now, since it keeps it less well-known, out of sight and therefore rarely busy. Great for a quiet late lunch/dinner, or take out.



I would compare the quality of the food to that of a good Japanese restaurant in the Bay Area, for those of you familiar, but with slightly higher prices (combination dinner + a roll is about $30) since it is, after all, on The Strip.



What I usually get:

- Combination lunch/dinner. Salad comes with miso dressing. Tempura is fried just right. Teriyaki chicken is crispy, not drenched in sauce. Portions are slightly smaller than what you'd expect, but everything is done well. If you order to-go they include the miso soup.

- A roll. Standard sized, a couple of dollars more than average ($13 - $17 instead of $10 - $13).



The (very friendly) staff are actually Japanese and speak Japanese to each other, if that matters. When I order for take out they bring me water or tea in a portable cup while I wait, which is a very nice touch.",positive

We were still glad they had a breakfast menu which included American and Japanese breakfast as well as handful of noodle bowl options.  



I had the Japanese breakfast and my girlfriend got the deep fried sweet tofu upon bowl. The miso soup was excellent and my breakfast was mostly really tasty. It had small portions of grilled salmon, rice, oranges, cantaloupe, soy beans, seaweed salad, and a regular salad with a light ginger dressing. Everything was delicious sans the fermented soybeans, but I'll attribute that to my own personal taste. It was also served with green tea which was great. 



The udon bowl was pretty typical, nothing fancy and the broth and noodles were good. The deep fried sweet tofu was kind of  different, but still kind of tasty.

It could just be me...but they have changed things up a bit since then and I'm just not quite as bit of a fan.



Either way, if you are looking for some good Tapas...do NOT go any further than Arpa",positive
ts66,4/29/2008,revtest4298,3,"I was a little disappointed with Arpa.  I've had tapas plenty of times in a lot of different places (including Spain), so I knew what to expect - tapas = small plates = small portions.  But at Arpa, it was just a little too easy to run up a big tab and leave hungry.



""Large"" pitchers of sangria run $20 and are heavy on fruit, but light on wine.  Baskets of bread are $3.50 each, and the create-your-own antipasto had larger servings of ""accessories"" than meats or cheeses.



All of the food was solid - the albondigas (lamb meatballs) were large and good and the bread wasn't bad - and it's cool to be able to relax outside and check the scenery.  But when you spend $40-50/person, you wouldn't expect to leave feeling like you need to hit up Taco Bell on the way home.



I'm rooting for Arpa to find its niche, but Press (just down the street) wins the Trade Street tapas/small plates game hands down.",negative
ts66,5/25/2008,revtest4299,3,"My husband and I have been to Arpa three times now, and all times I've been pleased with the selection of food we've gotten. I love tapas because of the variety you get at one meal without stuffing yourself. We've had good tapas in Spain, and found that Arpa came pretty close, though not exactly on point.  As several reviews have already stated, it can get pretty pricey if you want to leave stuffed, but to hit your comfort zone, there are a few dishes that will satisfy without emptying your pockets.



First, they do have some wine special nights, which can get you half-priced bottles, so do some research before you go. I would recommend reservations on those nights, because it can get pretty crowded.  Also, the first Wednesday of every month (I believe) they have wine and tapas tasting for $12 a person.  Pretty sweet deal.



In terms of 'good buys' on the menu, the flatbreads are pretty cheap and it's a fair amount of food. They are also very tasty.  The chick peas under the vegetarian section, are fairly cheap, and come in broth--like a soup almost--which will fill you up.  We also had a lamb-meatball dish (I don't remember the exact name), that was really tasty.  



The atmosphere is nice. We've always sat in the front bar area on the sofas/stools because we've never called for reservations. As I mentioned, it can get pretty crowded, but still easy to have a conversation, and listen in on others :)  The waitstaff is attentive, since the whole point of tapas is to keep the food coming.  Overall, we have enjoyed our visits here, and plan on returning soon.",negative
ts66,5/25/2008,revtest4300,4,"Speed week in Charlotte was a CRAZY place to be so when I came across Arpa I was curious as to what I would find.  Across the street from the Marriot in downtown Charlotte right on Trade Street this very chic restaurant turned out to be a gem.  



The bar area is very nice.  There is plenty of inside seating both in the bar area, the rear of the restaurant as well as outdoor cafe seating.  I chose the bar on both visits.  



Friday night the first big night of speed week was a complete trip.  Some little German dude who was drunk off his butt wanted to use the bathroom and pretended to speak German.  I asked the host if she spoke drunk and the short little dud hissed.  



He then headed for the bathroom where he started some trouble with a local and had his phone snapped in half and tossed out the door!



This is not indicative of a normal night at the bar.  I had a great flat bread with figs, truffle oil and Chrizo.  Yummy.  The next night I had a flat bread with Soprasatta, Han and some other Italian mean with a marmalade.  I know I am not getting it right but it was great food.



The most expensive part were the drinks.  I had the classic red sangria, 2-3 classes in a pitcher for $12.00.  Then I switched to white Russians with Sky Vodka.



I suggest the Flan (Caramel) dessert with a reduction of minced orange marmalade.  To die for.  



Look to spend 50-60 bux a person with booze but it is well worth it.  The staff is extremely friendly and then make a mean White Russian.",positive
ts66,9/16/2008,revtest4301,5,"I can't believe Arpa got such low reviews! It's a little expensive, and you sometimes have to keep ordering, but the food is fantastic. One of the best things I've ever eaten is the goat cheese with honey. Who would have thought of mixing goat cheese and honey? 



So if you're going to Arpa, be prepared to spend money and order everything you want in doubles. It's part of the fun of tapas. 



The service and presentation is definitely fine-dining, although the atmosphere is a little more casual. I think it's a great place for girls' night out...like the kind of girls' night out where you're dressing up and pretending to be the Sex in the City chics...or for date night.",positive
ts66,10/15/2008,revtest4302,3,"Arpa's OK. It's a little over-done as far as the artwork and set-up of the place; it's not the most comfortable place and can get pretty crowded and loud with banker types. But it's a big space, so it can house larger groups and parties, which is nice. I went there recently with about 12 people, and we got a nice big circular table, which worked out great. 



The food at Arpa is actually pretty good, although I can't say I was all that into the portion sizes (then again, i never am at Tapas places). You're paying a lot, it seems, for not a lot of food, but like I said, that might not be specific to Arpa. 



Arpa does have a great selection of wines (all types) and some good drinks, too, and it definitely seemed like a hotspot as far as post-work drinks/early evening partying. 



I ordered a special tasting menu, which was pretty good. Four different wines paired with 4 small dishes, so you really get, well, a taste for what the restaurant offers. I plan on going back in the future to check it more in-depth.",positive

It looked so mellow and a great place for conversation over a glass of wine.  I finally took some out-of-town guests to Arpa, mainly because a couple of other places we tried to go were too crowded on a weekend night.  We were seated right away and ordered some wine. 



I had heard from a couple of different sources that the lamb meatballs were delicious, so they had to be one of our tapas choices.  We followed that choice with the three-dip combo, a cheesy flatbread, calamari, chicken croquettas, and a salad for the three of us.  Yes, it sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are small (they're tapas, silly!).  Every item we ordered was delicious and the sizes were enough to feed our hunger, but it's more of a ""light meal"" type of place.   It's good if you're planning to go out someplace afterwards and don't want that really ""full"" feeling.  Plus, once you start ordering tapas after tapas, the bills sure adds up!  



I definitely enjoyed my experience at Arpa, but it's not a place I'd go to often.  It's more of a special occasion restaurant when you have a small group of friends that you want to catch up with.",positive
ts66,3/23/2009,revtest4305,3,"Spend lots of money, eat fresh, well-crafted food and leave hungrier than when you arrived.  



That pretty much sums it up.  I've eaten at tapas restaurants that charge less and offer a larger selection of dishes at more cost-related portions.  



I know tapas are supposed to be small, and that for a person to derive a complete meal, you have to buy 2 or 3 a piece.  But when each dish averages a price that's equal to or greater than a full meal at equally enjoyable restaurants, it's simply not worth it.

Now if you've been reading my reviews, I never judge a restaurant solely on experience, cause it's all about the food. I didn't mind the small size because it reminded me a family-style, close knit style of eating with friends and family.  



The food was decent but not the best I've had. I ordered the spicy pork and got some tofu soup on the side.  When the food came out, the portion size was not as big as other restaurants like Ari-rang or Bwon and did not have much flavor to it. It was kinda bland and not as spicy as I would've like it. Now I remembered one of my friends telling me you could get umlimited soup, so I went to the little station they had set up and it was seaweed soup. The problem with it was that it tasted like water and no flavor at all, so besides it being unlimited, one bowl was enough for me. Everything else was pretty good, the ban chan was good and I enjoyed the free refills on everything, and tofu soup portions were actually of good size.

The counter staff has always been very polite and helpful.  My favorite dish by far is the BBQ fresh bacon (I recommend this HIGHLY), but all of the dishes I've had from Woori Jib have been delicious.  The stir fried dishes come in large portions and have a nice mix of vegetables along with the meat.  The tofu stew is also very good combined with any meat, but is pretty spicy if ordered above mild, so bear this in mind.  The grilled fishes are salty and cooked just right.  The dumplings have a hand-made form and taste.  The kim chee is not as varied as at some restaurants, but also tastes ""fresh"" (as fresh as kim chee should be) and home-made.  If you do have a wait (which is common for any BBQ dishes made to order, at any restaurant), the cabbage soup is there, waiting for you.

Woori Jib clearly caters to the hungry college crowd - you place your order up front, pick up utensils, water, & free soup to the right, then snag a table & wait until your order is called out.  After you're done with your meal, you do have to bus your own table a la Ikea style. 



While Woori Jib is a little pricier than the other local Korean restaurants, it also ranks as one of the highest ones.  The meat-centric dishes will knock you back $10-$12, but you will certainly get what you paid for.  I've had the divinely tender Galbi Ribs & the charred Pork Belly, while the boyfriend is loyal to the Spicy Pork Bulgogi (the only downside is that half the dish was onions). The portion sizes are quite generous, where you can certainly split an entree to feed 2 people with the add cost of $2 for unlimited rice for both, or pack up the other half for some tasty leftovers!

ts67,6/9/2013,revtest4343,3,"Other reviewers have described Woori Jib as a ""hole in the wall."" It definitely is. The place is functional; it caters to the lunchtime campus crowd. The food isn't cheap (around $10-12 for an average lunch), but the place fills up. Most meals include a second bowl of rice for free and a side of kimchi (radish and cabbage style), which is good. The food is not elegant or fancy -- it is tasty, basic, and homestyle. To me, this is comfort food, the kind you might make yourself at home if you had the time (and tended toward Korean comforts). 



The beef bulgogi comes out sizzling, with thin sliced and seared white onions. It has been marinated in a sweet soy sauce and this sweetness caramelizes nicely upon grilling. The portion is big and filling.



The manduguk has a chicken broth base, and includes loads of mild beef dumplings. As is traditional onions, scallions, and eggs flavor the broth with a little dash of dried kelp on top.



The dolsot bibimbap is yummy. The meat was not marinated beef in strips, as I've had in the past, but ground beef (that was just okay). The mixed, steamed veggies and the chili paste with fried egg on top were delicious mixed with the crisped rice on the bottom. All that was finished just right.



Just to clarify what I've seen in other reviews, when you go in, your whole table orders at the counter together and is given a shared number. When someone from your table has an order up, your number is called. It may be called several times, at different points. If you order a dish that takes longer to prepare than others (like the manduguk) you will find other numbers higher than your own being called. These folks aren't cutting in line -- it's just part of the kitchen's process.



Once you pick up your order, you will stop by a side table near the counter to get your silverware / chopsticks, etc. When you have finished, you return to the front on the other side with your tray, which you place in a cafeteria cart. Efficient, no frills, but relatively fast even on busy days (15-20 minutes to get served something cooked up fresh to order).



BTW, I've also heard some reviewers writing in to say they feel they've been treated differently because they weren't Korean. I am a Caucasian American and have felt well treated at Woori Jib. Yes, the cashier has assumed on occasion that I and the white people in line behind me are eating together because, well, white. But that's no big deal.

There is however a sweet consolation---264 miles away from my area,there is Noodles. Surprisingly, I would find my favorite chinese food place inside a vegas hotel. But it's true, the exceptional taste of the food here brought back memories of my Hong Kong love affair with congee, dimsum, peking duck and noodles. Unlike other places I tried, their roasted duck is tasty yet not as greasy (you can even order it de-boned which makes for an even more enjoyable pigout). Their dimsum is topnotch. Basic selections like har gao, siu maai, bau and ma chang taste exceptional. My most favorite of all though is their seafood congee. Not a lot of chinese restarants serve this well, if at all, but in Noodles, they have it great. It has savory stuff like squid, scallops, mushroom, bokchoy, fish fillets in a tasty base (not watered down or too textured).I do wish they'd expand the dismsum menu and serve woo kok (mashed taro with shiitake mushrooms, shrimp, pork), and bring back the seasoned jellyfish. Other than that, I have no complaints. If you do love chinese food, and you know chinese food by heart, this place won't disappoint. And for those of you who prefer other asian cuisine, like korean, japanese, vietnamese or thai, Noodles also has tasty selections to satisfy your cravings (eg. pad thai, pho, kimchi, udon, and other favorites). Not the cheapest place, but definitely worth it. Did I mention the ambiance? It's a casual, comfortable place with minimalist beautiful decor by Tony Chi.

When we finally got seated, we were impressed with the elegance of the table - nice, laquered wood and rolls on the benches for reclining. We were immediately brought fresh tea, and they never let the teapot get anywhere close to empty. We could have ordered off the menu, but we chose dim sum. Every single piece of dim sum was amazingly delicious and very high quality. We especially liked the chef's special that day, which was a steamed dumpling with abalone and crushed peanuts. Our big complaint was that the dim sum carts did not come by often enough. Understandable given that most people in the restaurant were eating off the menu, but we were very hungry and got very frustrated waiting for the carts. The frustration factor would have lowered this rating to 3 stars, but having recently had some very boring and uninspired dim sum recently at another place back home (the food was lacking, not the company!), I was reminded of how delicious the food was here in comparison. Except for the dim sum carts, the service was attentive. The price was not as cheap as what we'd pay back home, but hey, this is Vegas, plus we were a small group, which makes the dim sum cost go up when you split it up per person.

We have tried other noodle shops around the other hotels but nothing can beat our taste buds for Noodles.



It's a bit pricey but well worth it.  Try going during the days they serve their dim sum.

When we got to the Bellagio, there was a line for the restaurant, but menus were posted so you could read while you waited. And the person in charge of the line was very efficient at seating people.



When we got our table, two of us immediately ordered ridiculous cocktails called White Tigers that might not have technically gone with the Chinese food we ordered, but were nonetheless delightful.



One of the people in our group ordered the pad thai dish people were slagging, and we both liked it. I tell you this, friends, having eaten some pad thai in my day.



My dish was a bean curd with mushrooms and bok choy which is exactly up my alley, especially since it came with white rice that I could just ignore and so had a fighting chance of finishing my food. (The people that order noodles will need to share or take some home.) 



The bean curd (like fried tofu pieces) and shiitake mushrooms were great, and they cooked the bok choy like you're supposed to, so they're still tender-crisp instead of being overcooked into little puddles of limp green sadness.



After my cocktail I ordered coffee, which might have been The Best Cups Of Coffee I've Ever Had. I wouldn't shut up about it for the rest of the day.

I have to say, I was a lil surprised to walk out of there over $50 for two for food without cocktails.  Service was good, they were really busy, and I wouldn't rule out ever going there again, but next time it should be in the middle of the night, right after I won a ton of money.",negative

So after a few minutes of my ""ultimate feet pampering"" I dont know why, but I felt the need to ask this crazy woman where was a good place to have lunch on the strip, without having her send me to a burger joint.  So she suggested Noodles @ the Bellagio.  So first thing I think.....Bellgio? Expensive? then I think......whatever, its vegas, everythings expensive.



So I head there for lunch, and upon arrival, before your server even comes to your table, you are offered a small plate of dim sum, which we accepted, and it was absolutely deelish,  we then order a large sapporo ( which I love cuz its totally share-able) we shared a noodle plate which was a great idea because it was huge,  I was overall very pleased with everything, great place for lunch in Vegas.",positive

I always order the same thing but it's a good combination and I can't seem to stray from it.  Edamame is nothing special, but at $7.50 it's probably one of the most expensive edamames out there.  Spicy Cucumber is really really good too.  It's more like a Korean kimchee style and I don't get how they get the cucumber so consistantly  crunchy, sweet, and spicy but again, it's expensive..  I think it was about $7 or $8 for a SIDE DISH..  



My favorite all-time dish here is the braised beef & tendon soup with egg noodles.  The meat is cook well and is very tender, the egg noodles are thin and delicate, a really good combination, but the broth is a little too soy saucey.

It's a place for the rest of us, the ones who forked over a hundred bucks to see Cher across the street at Caesar's Palace and didn't want to sink the rest of our savings on a meal we were too tired to enjoy anyway.



This being Vegas, it's a lot nicer and contemporary than your standard noodle joint. It has rows of jars filled with all sorts of dried noodles set against a lighted wall - lest you make a mistake that this is not a noodle joint. We were served right away at about 9:30 on a Saturday evening, and the waiter was super-attentive. Jamie and I shared an $8 basket of five Shui Mai...pretty good and in need of the mustard sauce to spice them up (see my photo). Jamie went for the $18 plate of Spicy and Sweet Noodles with Chicken - which impressed us with the heft of the poultry pieces (see my photo).



But on my own, I decided to try their Congee Chicken - a smallish bowl with iddy-biddy chicken bits and scallions (see my photo). Not the best jook I ever had but it was nice balm for my then-sore throat. I thought the price was high at $13 - but it did hit the spot at a time when I least expected to have some comfort porridge. We got out of there for a little over fifty bucks, which does seem ridiculous, but hey, this is Vegas. I should be happy I got away with my shirt intact.

Although the food here isn't amazing, it's pretty good. You'll find a lot of food here that you won't anywhere else in Vegas. This place is pretty much run by Asian people, so a lot of the diners here are actually Asian people as well. Waitresses usually speak both Mandarin and Cantonese, and of course English. So even if you come with your non-English speaking parents, you won't get into a mess with ordering. Asians have a hard time adapting to fancy food, so this place is very comfortable to eat at. The price is bit high, but it's Vegas. If you're complaining about the prices, why are you in Vegas in the first place? Walk down the street to a McDonald's or something. Most of the dishes here are pretty authentic tasting, though some do have a modern or 'American' touch to them. Don't expect their iced teas to taste like the Asian cafe type! They're still the unsweetened American restaurant version. The decor is pretty cool. Just lit up walls with shelves of different types of dry noodles in glass jars. Also very clean! Waits are usually no more than 30 minutes from my experiences, though sometimes I see some pretty long lines.



Overview:

Great Asian food, especially for Vegas.

Modern decor. Nice utensils and plating. Well-lit restaurant. Very clean!

The doors opened at 11:00 AM, and I arrived at exactly 11:00 AM (I had work at 12:00 noon).  I explained to my waitress and the women manning the fried and steamed dim sum carts that I'm green in terms of my dim sum experience and I'd like their help.  I was given 3 or 4 items from each cart (ranging from $4 - $7 each) and left to my own devices.  Unfortunately, I cannot tell you what I was given, but I can tell you that enjoyed it all immensely, especially 2 or 3 of the items.  I left at 11:45 happy and only $40 lighter in the wallet.



My friend who introduced me to dim sum told me that now that I have a taste for it he'll take me to a dim sum restaurant that will trump Noodle, easily.

The chicken just fell off the bone and I ate every last bit.



The amazing food was well complimented by the cute decor and nice staff.  I will definately go again when in Vegas!",positive

Noodles is probably one of the cheaper venues at the Bellagio, but still overpriced for what we ordered. Paying $4+ for shrimp dumplings (hao gaw) is absurd, but hey, it's Vegas. I shared a $15 bowl of beef noodle soup with my friend and it was plentiful. The noodles were...well...noodles; There was only one piece of beef chuck and the rest were tendons; And the soup had a nice kick (hits the spot after a nasty hangover). It's a good place to visit if Chinese food is your comfort food, but I wouldn't be sad if I never came here again.

here are some of my favorites

century egg appetizer

any of the vegetables

taiwanese beef noodle (the broth is soooo good and meat is really soft)

hainanese chicken

thai noodle

Ok so the place is in the Bellagio but it's really not that expensive.  I didn't cry when I got the bill.  Sure it's an Asian place in a hotel.

It's a really busy restaurant but it's not huge so the serving staff will help each other out if you need something. What won this place over for me was the dessert. It was awesome to find an authentic Asian dessert right on the strip. Maybe I was just in the mood for it but the mango sticky rice dessert was delicious! They score half of a mango, just like my mom did for me when I was a kid. I don't know where they could possibly get such sweet fruit on the strip but I was scraping the peel with my lower teeth after I ate all the squares.

It took a while to be seated but it was worth the wait. My boyfriend, friend and I got some dimsum. We didnt get to try as much as we would have liked and it was almost over, but what we did get to try was fantastic!! Way better than expected.



The food was okay. We ordered veggie spring rolls which were good but i've had better. We also got the mongolian beef and some chicken friend rice. All yummy but by no means the best.

ts38,7/31/2014,revtest4427,1,"Terrible. Really, that is the only word you need - don't bother reading more because ""terrible"" really sums up the dining experience at Szechuan Express.



We ordered via grubhub's app. I ordered General Tso Shrimp, shrimp fried rice and a small extra white rice. The app offered a coupon so with 2 sodas I met the minimum to add on a free Young Chow fried rice.  Yea! Here comes dinner!



Delivery took a reasonable amount of time. The bag arrived and everything is packaged in Styrofoam. Two things here: 1. Who uses Styrofoam anymore?? it is terrible for the environment and 2. Styrofoam makes everything inside soggy. Yuck. And the sodas arrived warm. I guess they thought we'd like them for later or they are just too lazy to make the cokes cold.



At this point I notice that there are not only zero fortune cookies but zero packets of condiments. My kid was super bummed about the no-cookie bit (me too). Now for the food.



General Tso Shrimp. The shrimp are fried in a heavy batter, like a thick, cheap tempura. Since the batter takes longer to cook it does not take a genius to figure out that the shrimp is so over cooked that if you are lucky it is only just rubbery. Half of them were bone-dry and hard. Yes, they were that over cooked. I included a photo - the shrimp is a the bottom and is so shriveled that it looks just like the gummy tempura batter. Disgusting.  (psst - try this at How Lee - AMAZING)



Shrimp Fried rice. Wow. This was even worse. How they managed to hit both salty and bland is beyond me. The after taste was weird and off. It coated inside your mouth like dirty grease. One bite and the rest in the garbage.



Young Chow Fried Rice. I have had this before from a different place and that place was awesome. This one... and I am not exaggerating... made my daughter cry when I told her that was her dinner. Yes, full tears. I took a closer look and totally got it. I included a photo of it. The pork looks like jerky. I think there was chicken in it, who knows. It looked like vomit. I am not sure I would feed this to a dog it looked so unappetizing. The shrimp looked ok comparatively. No one ate this.



The white rice... yes, the ONE thing EVERY Chinese food place should be able to get right was even dry. Scraped up dry bits from the side and bottom. 



It's been just over an hour - and yeah, I ate some, like an idiot. I was starving. Now I feel sick, that bloaty, nauseous feeling with a slight headache bad food feeling...



Terrible. Just terrible.



edit: 9/3/2014 - the business and I had a colorful back and forth about my review over the weekend and the manager indicated that in order to have a satisfying meal that the diner should only eat in or pick up - that the delivery changes the quality of the meal. 



While I have my own opinions about this it appears that he likely also complained to YELP about my photos (and likely my review) of the meal I was served by his restaurant. these images, most notably, showed a shrimp so completely over cooked that it had shrunk to about 1/3 of its normal size and was swimming inside of the breading. the other image showed dry, unappetizing fried rice. 



What struck me the most about our emails was what I perceived as a complete lack of professionalism and inability to listen to feedback from a customer. Further, if he feels delivery is the issue when why offer it?  To be honest, the delivery was the only thing that met expectation - it arrived within 45 minutes. I have ordered take out from a wide variety of places and have had great meals with it taking even longer to get to me. 



so, bottom line for me? the kid who is managing this restaurant pretty much reinforced my opinion of his business. there are a LOT of options out there in this category and i will happily spend my money at any of those before I spend another penny with this place.",negative

Most locations, either in Pittsburgh or in New York, will just mix Srichacha and BBQ sauce, as requested. The location in 600 Grant St. every time gives me a hard time and berates me for doing so. This is not a difficult or complex request; instead of the Thai Peanut Sauce, just add the BBQ & srichacha sauce. Upon asking for this, I was told ""No."" When I asked why, I was told ""We don't do that."" Upon further inquiry, your staff did not have an adequate response and repeated, ""We don't do that. Other locations SHOULDN'T, and we don't."" This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. If you want to charge me extra for the mixture of sauces, fine.

ts248,11/17/2014,revtest4441,4,"After living in the area for so long and never trying Chan An, I decided to give it a go a few weeks back. Glad I did, because I'm now a fan.



It's definitely better than Phong May House (see my review if you want to compare). I think my initial reservations about going here revolved around what it looked like from the outside, and to some degree what it looks like on the inside as well. It's in the Crafton Ingram Shopping Center and it looks like a dive. But it's a great dive. There are tables for dine-in eating, but I'd say more than 90% of Chan An's business is take out. They don't do delivery.



But that's no big deal, as the food is always ready in about ten minutes, unless they're really busy, in which case it'll be twenty. So what's good here? 



Well, for starters, I love the wonton soup. Chan An uses a dark broth that is actually packed with flavor, unlike all the other Chinese eateries in the area which stick to a chicken-based broth, which is always flavorless for the most part. I don't get how that happens. Someone please explain it to me. The lack of flavor, not the base, that is.



I'm a fan of the sweet and sour pork here, as well as the cashew chicken. I've noticed Chan An likes to use lightly battered dark meat pieces of chicken with a darker sauce when it comes to some of their dishes such as the cashew chicken. It can sometimes be a little salty, but most days it's right on the money. Plus they also throw in water chestnuts, which I love and wish more Chinese restaurants would do. 



The egg rolls are really good. Not greasy, not overdone, but just right. The fried wontons are good and the beef on the stick is amazing. It's not your usual beef on a stick. Well, it is, but then they wind up deep frying the beef before skewering it, and I've never had it like that, but it's really tasty. It bring out the sweetness of the beef really well.



The people who run the place are super friendly and they'll do their best to accommodate your tastes if you want something made a little differently. The prices are good and in line with other affordable Chinese restaurants. So don't let the look of the place fool you. Chan An does a lot of business and I'd say that's mostly down to the quality of their food. Convenience is nice, too, but that doesn't always make for tasty eats.

Prices are ok.  You will be just under $10 for a combo with fried rice, egg roll, and drink. 



The General Tsos here is actually a little different than most.  The sauce is not as red and sweet as some. It's more brown and spicy.  It was different than expected but good. 



The service was very good.  The lady that took my order was polite and attentive.  After arriving I decided to eat in just to save time and she immediately brought my drink and egg roll over to my table. It was crisp and not greasy.  But good. 



The rest was served in the tiny silver takeout tray.  At first I was surprised, but when I realized I wasn't going to finish my meal, it made sense to serve it this way. When she noticed I wasn't eating anymore she brought over a lid and a bag to take home.

UPDATE: 12/22/2014



I'm upping my review of Chan An's to five stars (from four). It's become my regular go-to stop for quick and tasty Chinese food. The whole place is like one big happy family between the employees and the clientele. Everyone who goes is pretty much a regular.



A couple nights ago, I went and after I came in and placed my order, a small army arrived behind me. It got rather crowded quickly with everyone standing around waiting to get their takeout. At one point, the cashier was trying to tell one of the customers where the various sauce packets were and saw that there was one packet of soy sauce left in the bin. I offered to help him restock, and he directed me to where they kept all the packets. I was soon refilling the bins as fast as I could. It was amusing. It's that kind of place.



I returned again last night and te same guy and I talked a bit while I was waiting for my order. He had gone to the Strip District earlier in the day and bought some cheese. So we started discussing our mutual love for cheese, and I directed him to Wheel and Wedge and their great cheeses. He sliced off a piece of his Strip District cheese and handed it to me to share. It was tasty. I know this has nothing to do with Chan An's food, but it's this sort of laidback and enjoyable experience that keeps me coming back as much as the vittles.",positive

They make their burgers from fresh hamburger.  Sit at the bar and you can watch yours being made.  I opted for a cheeseburger all the way with chili.  All the way includes cole slaw, onion, mustard, and probably some other things which I'm forgetting.  The burger was juicy and tasty.  The fries are frozen, but they were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside which is exactly how I like them.  My burger, large fries, and two beers came to $13, you can't beat that.

In this case, however, maybe not so much.



First, finding your way into Hinson's isn't easy. It's not difficult, but it's not as simple as it could be. Then, as with the infamous Asian Corner Mall, you may need to check your alignment afterwards.



Second, the hours are not exactly regular, and the signage doesn't help. Typically you see a building with lit neon and you think ""open"". Not always the case here. They are supposedly open at 11am most days (they are not open Monday). At least one day, however, we came by and they weren't open when they ""should have been"". No explanation - just no one there. It wasn't even the typical July 4 week that some small companies take off. Just nobody around.



If you do happen to get by when they are there, the inside isn't much to look at (there is an inside, in comparison to say Brooks). Staff is friendly, if not overly welcoming. Food is decent, but not exceptional.



Now what makes them a ""drive in""? Nothing, really. Apparently they used to be a drive-in (think South 21 on Independence near Uptown), but since Independence/Highway 74 grew, they don't do that these days. Frankly, this cinder block building doesn't look much like it could have ever supported a drive-in. But that's neither here nor there, just a tidbit of information I found interesting.",negative
ts249,10/3/2014,revtest4452,5,"I recently have moved to Charlotte and i'm always looking for a new hole in the wall/dive/greasy spoon restaurant. I've drove by this place prolly 20 times and always wondered about it so i decided to check out the reviews and found were very good so i took the wife tonight and we order Turkey Burger with bacon {wife} she really liked it and very juicy and lots of flavor. I was debating on the Fire Burger and the pulled pork sandwich. I ordered the Fire Burger {double} medium rare and was cooked to perfection and one of the better greasy spoon burgers i've had in a long time. I like that all the burgers are not frozen and fresh made to order. We also had the tater tots, Onion rings and Corn nuggets. Wife said the tater tots were good and i loved the onion rings. The corn nuggets were decent. The regulars were pretty friendly and the owner manning the grills was also very friendly. We were delighted to find this gem. I see this being a regular place to have lunch. Looking forward to coming back next week.  Pulled pork sandwich look out!!!

PS. To get into this place is a bit confusing just ask my wife, But you drive down about 2 blocks past hinson's and turn right before the shell gas station. If you are at the shell station you have gone to far. Also once you take the right you go down prolly 200 feet and take immediate right and go down what you would call a frontage road i guess and park out back. Don't let the outside fool ya it's worth the stop. We ordered 2 sandwiches and 3 apps and order was right at $20 pretty tough to beat that.",positive

Average price is $6-$8 for a grinder of calzone. The girl who took our order was incredibly friendly. Our food was brought within 8 minutes and I was impressed with the taste of my Turkey Reuben Grinder. The calzones were also quite tasty, and massive. Good place for lunch or casual dinner.",positive

Their salads are atypically good for an establishment like this: there's actually more to them than iceberg lettuce and ranch.  However, I am only giving Rudino's two stars because they are pricey (which, admittedly, is fairly typical for that part of town) and the service is on the slow side.",negative

I ordered a salad, paid for it, and then was told they were out of lettuce.  I then switched to the pizza buffet.  There was one pizza out for the entire restaurant, and we were told it would be fifteen minutes before more were provided.  It just seems odd that a restaurant that caters primarily to people on their lunch breaks would be so unprepared for lunch.",negative

So i went a few doors down to Bobbie O's BBQ and had their as usual great pulled pork sandwich. 



I had to walk past this place on the way back to my car 20 minutes later. Looked in the window. Still no buffet.

What they call a buffet is a joke.  Two half eaten pizzas and about 3 pieces of garlic bread.  The pizza was hot and very cheesey which s good, but otherwise nothing worth mentioning.  Also, for an all you can eat buffet, you're going to draw eat in customers.  Very little seating in there.  But the place is very small and I don't know how they would fit any more tables in there.  Kind of a mismatch of menu and space really.  



Plenty of better lunch spots in the area.  I won't be back.  Go two doors down to Bobee O's and have some BBQ.

ts41,9/23/2007,revtest4461,4,"My favorite bar in Charlotte, because of the atmosphere and the ping-pong tables outside.  Perfect for cool summer nights and really any season in Charlotte except for when its raining.  Decent beer selection, but nothing spectacular...like I said its the atmosphere of Thomas Street that makes it so cool, everyone is just there to chill, drink, meet up and have a good time.  The stadium seating near the ping-pong table adds to the unique attitude of this bar and when the competition heats up you can feel it throughput the lower part of the outdoor bar.  When the temperatures dip south they have fire pits in some of the outdoor tables as well as the traditional stand alone outdoor heaters. So come outside, drink a beer and gaze at the stars, and feel the vibe of Thomas Street; my favorite bar in Charlotte, it's unpretentious and straight -up chill so come kick it, if it isn't already ridiculously crowded...if it is... head up the street to P-Stone.",positive
ts41,12/2/2007,revtest4462,5,"This place is a quick walk across the street from Penguin In. I went with friends and we sat in the back. I was more impressed with this place than I thought I would be. I'm not sure what it would be like full - we went on a Tuesday night - but it looks like it could be fun. 



My friends and I all ordered Blue Moon beer. The newly pregnant one ordered a Shirley Temple and got a hint of an eye roll from the server. Even so, we loved our server - he was attentive and friendly, checking back often to see if we were doing alright. 



It was cold that night, so I couldn't talk the group into going outside to enjoy the fire on the patio. However, if and when I go back, I will certainly check it out. I love the stadium seating out there. 



 think the layout of this place was the most impressive to me. They have a front patio where dogs can hang out too, then you walk into a long bar where I'm sure the regulars sit, then a seating area on the ground level leads to the back where more tables are available on a raised platform. Couple this with the back patio and its ping pong action, and you've got yourself a really friendly neighborhood bar worth coming home to.",positive
ts41,12/27/2007,revtest4463,5,"This is one of my favorite bars in Charlotte. It's super laid back, and actually reminds me a lot of a San Francisco bar (where I live now).

Cheap beer and out back they've even got a series of ping pong tables, complete with stadium seating so that you can watch game after game.",positive
ts41,3/18/2008,revtest4464,4,"I'm a big fan of Thomas Street Tavern, in part because it's a great atmosphere, and also because it's right across the street from the Penguin.  Can you get any better?  Fried pickles at the Penguin and then beers and ping pong at Thomas Street?  No, didn't think so.



Relatively cheap prices on their beers and a big selection is one of the main reasons we keep coming back here.  The last couple times they've been out of this beer or that, have to wonder if they have problems keeping their bar stocked or if they just have that much of a crowd. 



Wait staff has always been good and friendly; quick with the beers or a recommendation.

It's a great place to hang out to meet new people, or go with a group of people.  It seems to be a very ""chill"" place and completely non-hostile.  They offer a nice variety of beers on tap at a fair price.  I would recommend to others.",positive

The bartenders are attentive and friendly.  And for an added bonus they have a pretty good Scotch selection.  



Thomas Street Tavern reminds me of gringo bars in Mexico that are a little bit out of the way but if you ask the right people or poke around enough, you'll inevitably wind up here.  Slightly eclectic crowd, cabin fever locals, musicians who are off the clock, road worn travelers.  And everyone there just wants to get away from the fray, not too loud, be casual, mingle and leave everything else behind...



The juke box could use some more choices, but all in all a decent Friday night bar where you could spend a good long time decompressing.  Don't dress up and don't eat here.",positive

However, I went on a crowded Saturday night.  If I went again I would go on a weeknight, so I could participate in some of the games outside.  There is a cute little cabanaesque bar outside on the patio, I would recommend going outside because it is much less congested.  Not only that, the guys who hang out around the pool table are kind of pushy and not really people friendly.  I did get a chance to meet the owner towards the nights end and he was very approachable, and seemed to care about his guests.  Overall, my experience was decent, but a little too frat-tastic for my taste.",negative
ts41,9/16/2008,revtest4468,3,"I've had the best of times and the worst of times at Thomas Street. I think it has a lot to do with the crowd..if it's a packed-in-like-sardines kind of night, I'm not likely to go in. I don't like the crowd, and the service gets pretty (understandably) sloppy when it's busy. The whole scene reminds me of college a little too much...screaming folks enamored with their own drunkenness...If you're in the mood for college antics, it's a great place to go.



On the other hand, I've had great experiences at Thomas Street during the afternoons. It's good for lunches with friends, especially in the summer with the patio. On evenings when it's not too crowded, the drama at the ping pong table can be pretty intense. (Has anyone else noticed that Charlotte has a weirdly elaborate ping pong culture?)



I like Thomas Street's food, which is solid as far as standard American bar food goes. I'm getting a little old and crochety about big crowds, but overall, it's a safe bet for a good place to go out for night life or for a good dinner.",negative
ts41,9/30/2008,revtest4469,3,"Some nights, Thomas Street is the perfect neighborhood hangout. The large back patio allows you to relax and enjoy the warm weather (or the glow of the heat lamps in the winter). But other nights, it's packed with a snobby crowd that resembles a frat party. Basically, Thomas Street has gotten too popular for its own good. 



When I go in, I head straight for the back patio, where there is a separate bar and the smoke isn't quite so thick. The food is OK for bar food, but it typically takes a long time before it arrives. Still, the Ping-Pong is free, and the drinks are cheap.",negative

What I enjoy about Thomas Street is that it's unpretentious: what you see is what you get.  Pool table, back patio, plenty of seating, decently priced beers and adequate service.  TVs that are just perfect for moving your eyes towards when your conversation lulls or when that hot guy you've been checking out catches you staring at him (just pretend you're looking past him, right?

It was chilly outside, so there were a couple of tiki torches lit.  We stepped off the porch and down to the patio by the ping pong tables, and there was an unlit torch, so I decided to go light it from the one on the patio myself.  As I was about to light it, someone grabbed the stand, and I wheeled around to see one of the staff with an angry face ask me ""What are you doing? The fire marshal told us yesterday that we couldn't have these, and now you're dripping oil all over the patio.""  Now I understand that this guy probably has to deal with lots of drunken crazies with pyro fetishes (after all there's a table at the outside bar that has a fire pit in it), and he needs to be firm to get his point across, but I did not at all appreciate that tone when there were clearly other tiki torches lit around the porch, and there was not a drop of oil on the ground under the torch that I was holding.  Ok, whatever, ""I'm so sorry, I'll just sit down"".  Three minutes pass, and the same guy walks out to light the said tiki torch.  He then pats my arm and says ""There you go, honey, your torch is now lit.""  Please don't touch me, particularly if you don't know me, and you were just reprimanding me with angry eyes.  I know you're trying to make nice, but the touching only makes it creepy.  5 minutes later, a different guy on the patio who was smoking and talking on his cell phone closes his phone forcefully while uttering a choice expletive and walks up to the tiki torch, blowing it out with wet, smoky breath.  He then proceeds to walk up to the porch and blow them all out, and recruit the original employee from my story, and they carry all the now blown-out tiki torches back to the shed where no one can mess with them.  Guess the fire marshal did call.



Whatever, I understand, just wish they'd had their story straight.  So now I'm watching ping pong, and helping retrieve the balls that fall under the net (why bother to have a net if it doesn't go all the way to the ground to catch the balls), and all of a sudden the first employee comes running out with angry eyes to yell at the girl who put her bottle on the table.  Again understandable, but she was not being drunk or belligerent, and it was the first time, for like 2 seconds.  Clearly this guy has had to deal with one too many people and just doesn't care about being hospitable any more.



All that said, I did like this place.  There could have been more heaters out back, but the ping pong, cornhole, and fire pit by bar were awesome.  I would go back.  As long as I wear heavier clothes for the cold weather, and make sure to be on my best behavior.",negative

I met her there and the place was typical of a bar/pub.  The back patio looked nice and large, which is where I've heard it's really chill to drink out back during the summer, but as this was a cooler day in Charlotte (high 30's), this was not so appealing.



The staff was helpful and friendly and pretty attentive, so this was clearly not what caused me to give them 2 stars.  It was the food.  I had a burger w/ fries and my friend had a BLT w/ fries.  It's not that it wasn't cooked properly or wasn't decent, it's just that it wasn't anything special and when it comes to bar/pub food in Charlotte, there certainly are other places that are much, much better.



All in all, it felt more like a bar/pub restaurant chain more than a neighborhood hangout and I was certainly expecting more.

During the week, you will find a less crowded more chill scene, and on the weekend it is usually packed after 10:30 (but not in a way that makes it annoying).  The outside patio has cornhole, and ping pong tables -  inside there is pool and foozball.  



The bartenders are very down to earth.  The drink prices are the best I've seen in Charlotte, and they are poured generously.  



This is NOT a club scene, top 40 kind of place.  You will find a juke box with mostly alternative and classics.  Come dressed down, and be prepared to get comfortable and have a great time.  Oh, and if you are leaving the bar solo at night, a bartender or bouncer is always happy to walk you to your car (in fact, they insist!).

Back to the food.  I have a couple favorites, one being the Chicken Tweety (I think it's called Jessica's Tweety now).  Grilled chicken breast with lettuce and tomato on a toasted hoagie roll with garlic salt butter atop the bread that really makes the sandwich great.  My other favorite is the Johnny Dollar Beach Burger.  Huge burger topped with whatever you like and sure to fill you up, no worries!  They also have an option to build your own sandwich which is great if you are looking to make a veggie sandwich with lots of fresh ingredients.

T he game we were looking for wasn't on but he was nice enough to put it on one of the many TVs.   I ordered the california club which was delicious!  And had a few irresistible $2 PBRs. But the winning quality for me was that they keep the juke box going even when the games are on, which I love, but it could have been pumped up a decibel or few.



They have chalkboard walls in the restrooms but  BYOC (bring your own chalk)  jukebox and pool table near the front.  Awesome back patio with baggo boards, table tennis, and wall hooky.  As well as a fire pit, TVs, two bars and plenty of seating.



fyi - order wings or ribs on sunday and get entered to win a trip to vegas.  We won the package trip and it's not without a catch.... the airfare is 2 for 1 at regular price and the hotel package is sunday - thursday, the $500 in vegas chips is a coupon book to vegas.... so, while it's still super cool to win anything especially an excuse to go to vegas, it's not exactly a free trip to vegas.",positive

It debited my account twice for the $100 but never dispensed my money. 1 transaction was automatically reversed, the second wasn't. The next day I called the number on the front of the ATM and was informed they no longer process the transactions. FOR 10 days I have been leaving messages (5 total) for the manager Scott, with not one call back. Twice in person and 3 times on the phone, I have explained that I am just trying to find out who owns the machine and I can take it up with them. After 10 days with no phone call back, it is obvious this establishment does not care about its customers, only the bottom line at the end of the night.

The drinks here can get a bit expensive though. My friend had 2 margaritas and the tab came out to $25!! What?! I am kind of used to $6-10 margaritas. I went with the eternally girly Malibu bay breeze and it was fairly decent on pricing.



This place is a cool place for chilling with your bros and girlfriends but I think I'd recommend pregaming at home or Common Market down the street before heading here and hitting up the games and keeping your drink orders to a minimum.",positive

I've only eaten here a couple times at lunch and the food is pretty good but I personally enjoy just hanging here for drinks. There are also other bars within walking distance so it's a great place to start a fun weekend night or get some sun on a Sunday Funday!



Special tip: There are 3 restrooms inside the restaurant and 2 of them are typically designated for the ladies so the lines are always really quick for females, which is awesome! Also, the potty rooms have huge chalkboards on the wall so patrons have fun doodling notes to their friends and other random peeps who use the facilities. Totally random but FUN!

Huge outdoor patio with Cornhole and Ping-Pong tables (if you can ever get to them) and an outdoor bar to keep your mind at ease. It does get crowded pretty much any day the weather is nice. And for some reason a random mosh pit/ dance party mix up has developed every time I have visited the patio... Not a complaint, just an observation. Cathy has always been at the patio bar when I have visited and always does a killer job. Food is standard bar fair. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but def a good place to drink and relax... or dance if you feel so inclined. Only downside are the bathrooms.

The staff is really good, and even when it's jam-packed you won't have to wait too long to get a beer. The downside to Thomas Street (and it's a HUGE one) is that it's usually packed full of young frat boy, wannabe hipster bankers. Like, people who aren't hip enough for Snug Harbor, but are too cool for the clubs Uptown. If you can get a big enough crowd to ""insulate"" yourself from these morons, it's a good time.

The atmosphere here is amazing. You have a bar inside with tv's, a foosball table, and a pool table.  During the week it begins to feel like cheers where the bartenders remember your name and your drink.  The bartenders actually are pretty cool down to earth people here. The outside section is where this bar shines.  There is plenty of seating with fire pits and another bar outside. They have a net enclosed ping pong area which is always fun trashed, cornhole, and the akward game where you have to get the ring on the hook. This mix of people here is great.  From locals, to hipsters, to college kids, and anyone else in between.  



For me if you don't want to go to a club Thomas Street is always an amazing place to go.  There is so much fun things to do outside and the people watching is great.  The bar prices are not expensive at all and there are many other bars to hop to close by.  The food here is acceptable, but I would probably eat somewhere else if I could.

I met a few friends here for food and drinks on a weekday night recently.  The food was good, not great - standard bar fare.  I recommend the onion rings.  



The ambiance on this weeknight was a bit dull and drab as I stated.  Its not that anything was WRONG, there was just something missing.  I soon remembered that every previous time I'd been to Thomas Street was during the spring or summer time.  I feel like the cold, weather def has a negative affect on TST.  This is probably because so much about this bar is predicated on its extensive outdoor patio set-up. 



I must admit, I feel somewhat bad about this review, because I have been here plenty of times on Summer nights and this place has been awesome in every way.  With that being said, its probably best to hibernate away from Thomas Street until the weather warms up a bit...",negative

Inside is fairly spacious and outside there is a large patio with ping pong and corn hole. The crowd is generally pretty mixed, younger and older.



They have a decent beer selection and daily specials, and the food is pretty good, too. They do sandwiches, burgers, wings, and appetizers. Everything is fresh (food and beer), and service is consistent.

I'd most likely pick one of Charlotte's premier breweries or even a passable taproom/pub over any bar/watering hole in town. Buuuuuut....throw in a couple of ping pong tables and I'm hooked. I'll hold a paddle and slam backhands all night long, regardless of where it is, with a grin from ear to ear. Heck, if there were a pingpong table at my wife's nail salon I'd go every time. 



Thomas Street is a great dive-y bar to meet up with some friends for some sub-par grub and plenty of foamy brews. I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed a good greaser or hoagie. Hey Oh, heartburn! It's always worth it, though, isn't it? 



Best part about this joint is the back patio. Not much to shake a stick at in the winter time or if the sun isn't shining on a Saturday afternoon, but when it's right, this place is the crown jewel of hangouts on Thomas Ave. Cornhole, plenty of bench seats, tables, draughts outside, and many a lively 20-something enjoying it all the same. Again, ping pong tables? Count me in. Note: it can be rather difficult to nudge your way in line to grab a game. Kindly ask bro-ho du jour for next game and you should be good.

Last time that I was there, my friend and I ordered the spinach artichoke dip.  So good.  Served with the right amount warm pita bread.  I have never been disappointed with their food.  The interior is just right for a neighborhood pub, and it features front door and back door outside spaces.

ts41,2/21/2014,revtest4518,4,"Thomas Street Tavern has become my go-to Plaza Midwood bar -- great patio space, cheap drinks, outdoor games, interesting clientele, and solid bar food.  I didn't know they served food until last night, but man, what a pleasant surprise!  I was expecting the worst because---let's call a spade a spade---Thomas Street is a dive.



The menu is as random as the clientele, but mostly consists of sandwiches.  I had the chili nachos, cheese fries, and BLT with fries (take your judgment elsewhere, it was my cheat meal).  It was all really delicious in the greasy bar food kind of way.  And it was all really cheap.  That being said, the service was kind of shitty.  There was one waitress for the entire patio and she was just so over it... or possibly on drugs.



Like I said before, the clientele is interesting, which is both a good and bad thing.  Sometimes interesting means funny and cool; sometimes interesting means super hillbilly and creepy.  I find that you can generally avoid the latter type of interesting by staying in the patio/fire pit area, as they tend to congregate around the pool tables and outside bar.



Also great for nights when you just don't feel like wearing big girl/boy pants.  Nobody here will think less of you for wearing sweatpants and flip flops.",positive
ts41,3/2/2014,revtest4519,5,"Awesome place for a day drinking adventure or just a good, fun night!! Walking in, this can be extremely deceiving. It's dark wood and somewhat old school.

They have ping pong and corn hole as well as fire pits patio seating and a bar out back. Tons of TVs an they keep this back area pretty heated in the colder months  



Overall this is a really cool bar. Locals are often found here as it is situation just outside of downtown. The area has tons of restaurants but Thomas street offers a full menu as well.  a must go if you live in Charlotte.",positive
ts41,3/16/2014,revtest4520,5,"Oh Thomas street. How I love thee. My favorite bar, and for one reason and one reason only. The staff. They make regulars and strangers feel comfortable. Its my version of ""cheers."" Everybody knows your name. Pretty much my second home.",positive
ts41,5/2/2014,revtest4521,5,"I have been going here for a solid 10 years. That makes me feel old. It also makes me feel like I am finally a real Charlottean to be able to say that. 



The Good:

This is a true neighborhood bar. This isn't hipster. It will never be hipster. Thomas St is simply T St. It never changes much- even with the neighborhood changing. You can easily go there and see people from all different walks of life, ethnicity, age and income. 



The outdoor area really is the best in Charlotte. I dare you to find one that is more comfortable, welcoming, not pretentious and with a lot of plants (seriously Charlotte- so many outdoor areas here are not landscaped).  There are games galore and plenty of seating. Lots of heaters and fire pits. 



This is one of the best spots in the city to watch TV outside. One of my favorite days was watching a game outside under the patio while there was a storm. 

The Nachos can be really good (not always), the chicken fingers are highly recommended (especially the honey mustard), the king veggie burrito is a favorite with the vegetarians and the commonwealth roast beef is for the meat eaters.



You can bring your dog!!! (do not walk him through the restaurant- there is usually a gate open in the back. Ask someone to open it if it isn't)



They still have the same crappy Christmas decorations, there are always people willing to play pool (it is very communal- you don't own the table with your BFF- at Thomas St you share), the TV's are usually on mute because this isn't really sports bar. It is more like a neighborhood hang out.





The Bad:

T St is not consistent. You might go there and have really good food. The next time you go- meh. 



This used to be a fun place on a Saturday night. Now it is a during the week type of a place or during the day. The Friday and Saturday night crowd is really annoying. Think: part busses from University. It turns into a really awkward meat market. Avoid late night on weekend.



The service can be bad. We accept this about T St. In fact, I'm sort of happy that it hasn't changed. Don't get me wrong- there are some really good servers who have been there for years. But there is also a ""I don't care"" attitude that happens. Don't take it personally. It is part of Thomas Street's charm and irritation. 



I personally love this place, but it isn't for everyone, nor should it be.",positive

ts41,7/21/2014,revtest4528,4,"This place was one of the most interesting bars I've been to! Went here on a Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon to provide you with an honest opinion... This place is hard to find.. If you are not a local or don't know one, you probably wouldn't know about this place since it is out of the tourist area.



Food experience wise.. Saturday evening gets crowded and busy with a small selection of craft beer.  Ordered some chicken tenders tossed in buffalo with a side order of cheese tots!  The chicken tenders were definitely something I was looking for.. They give you a generous portion and do not over bread the chicken before they fry it.  The chicken was tender with every bite.  The cheese totz were good on Saturday night because they were crispy with enough sharp cheddar cheese.  Sunday afternoon the chicken tenders were just as satisfying as Saturday but the cheese totz were soggy and soft.. There was no crunch to it.. And the serving experience on Sunday was terrible.. I had to go find my waitress to order and find her to pay for my bill... Saturday night this gentleman provided my party and I with amazing service and was prompt.



OK... Now what makes this bar so different.. In the back patio there are two tables of ping pong for guests to play, two ""sink and hook"" games, and 2 sets of corn hole games! Saturday night gets really busy so its hard to play corn hole or ping pong and on Sunday there was only one corn hole game out since there wasn't a high amount of requests for it.



Overall, very chill and relaxing bar. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to drink and play games with friends...",positive
ts41,9/7/2014,revtest4529,4,"I went to the Tavern on a Friday night. They had a cover charge of $5 because of the band that was playing. There was a mixed crowd which is always a good thing.

Such a local feel, with neighborhood kids of all ages (drinking age of course) and their dogs! Everyone is super friendly and there is normally a corn hole or ping pong game to jump in on. And that fun game with the sting and hook - what is that game??? I don't know but its hours of fun and conveniently located next to one of Thomas Streets two bars in the back area. 



You gotta love a bar that takes their live music seriously too - its always good. Its also a pretty rad lace for Sunday football. There aren't enough TVs to watch every game at once outside from one seat but I can't lie to you ... its kind of nice. It causes more banter and chat with soon to be close friends and lets be real - this whole NFL ticket thing is great but slow down! Remember our parents didn't have this luxury. Plus that ESPN app is pretty killer. BUT if you must see all 5 to 7 games from your seat go inside. That big ass screen and all the TVs lining the walls will suit your fancy just fine.",positive

There is absolutely nothing to dislike about this place. Walk in and you get that old bar feel, with friendly bartenders to greet you on the right and a pool table on your left. Be sure to order an extremely affordable beer ($4.50 draught everyday!) for yourself. The taps rotate, but yesterday included the Triple-C IPA, Highland Gaelic Ale, Guiness Stout, Noda Midnight Madness, and more. 



After you choose a delicious craft brew, keep walking out back and you'll find another bar entirely, TWO Ping Pong tables, and a Cornhole set ready to rock. I spent the better part of last night holding down a table, which is exactly the confidence boost a struggling doctorate student needs every once in a while.

 A pasta dish runs about $11 and is a sizable portion.  The bruchetta was good, the tomatoes were a little boring (not enough garlic or spices) but the bread was perfect, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  



The pink sauce is absolutely freakin' fantastic.  it comes with peas and crunchy prosciutto. It is rich, creamy and has a perfect bite from the parmesan sprinkled on top.  I kept having to smack my boyfriends fork away after I gave him a taste, he kept trying to sneak more, he even kept trying to dunk bread into the sauce!  I am totally hooked on it.  



The pizza prices are very reasonable, I plan on checking their pizza out next.",positive
ts42,12/29/2010,revtest4545,5,"Took my parents to this location Christmas Eve for lunch.  Personally I'm a big lunch person because you pay less for almost the same amount of food as dinner time.  That aside, I've been a long time fan of Portofino's (SouthPark, Ayrsley & Eastway locations). There are days I literally CRAVE their pasta Mediterraneo (I always order mine with capellini).  For $7, you can't beat this.  Chopped seafood (definitely has calamari in it) with mussels and all stirred up in a creamy pink sauce... this is my FAV pasta choice.  And yes, I almost always order this dish, which is soooo against my normal rule of trying new things.



Don't forget their bread, which is baked freshly... and a little tip: dip it in their house salad dressing!  OMG... it's awesome! (NOTE: if you are allergic to garlic, or don't like garlic, or don't want to smell like garlic, don't attempt this... but then why on earth are you in an italian restaurant?!)



Their other dishes are good too.  Pizza is huge, and was told to be very authentic NY style.  At my old work we used to order them for lunch, and the cheese would slide all over the place by the time I got it back to work because it's so fresh and hot (hence I'm not a pizza delivery person)



This location isn't as ""fancy"" looking, but it's close to my home.  For more romantic outings... you may want to drive a little further to the Park Road or Ayrsley location.",positive
ts42,1/29/2011,revtest4546,5,"Wow. WOW. WoW! wOw! w0w! WOWZERZ! woooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! Any way you say it, Wow is the first word that comes to mind with this place. Sure, the parking lot always said ""MUG ME"", but after my dinner tonight at Portofino's on Eastway, I'll never look at this shopping center the same.



Came in around 6:30 on Saturday and this place was jumpin! Lots of couples, and a few families, we were seated immediately and started off with the Capri - buff.mozz, tomatoes, basil, mushrooms, roasted red peppers and oil/vin/spices. Everything was great, the portion was definitely big enough to split between 4 (there were only 2 of us), and the homemade bread that came out with it.... ohhhh madre, it was excellent. Everything was fresh and well seasoned. 



I chose to go with the Mediterrano (w/ the pink sauce and Capelinni) due to the other reviews about it and whoa - 5 stars! Light, flavorful and multi-leveled, the pink sauce was just as good as my Nana's and I've never been able to compare her to anyone! My date went with the Scilian pizza with sausage and onions. $14.00 for the biggest pizza I have seen in recent memory. He loved it, and we've got the left overs so I'm excited to try it tomorrow (I was too busy making ""MMMM"" sounds to my pasta to try his pizza).



The grand finale left me speechless: THE CANOLI. We ordered 1 each and I swear I could have eaten 15. Filled completely through, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cocao, this canoli was a gift from the gods. I can't remember the last time I had a canoli this good was, and it makes me want to never try anywhere else's canolis because this was just the tip top of the mountain and nothing else is going to ever compare. I'm serious. I'M SERIOUS FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY - this canoli was just amazing.



Service was great, speedy and kind. Parking is easy, abeit a little rough looking. Portofino's, I love you and I love you even more since you're a few blocks from my home. If I ever sell, I will be sure to note you in my ads as a ""plus"" to homeownership around here! :)",positive

No big deal my child was in the restroom.  Problem when I asked the server to please comp the salad she was like well its included.  I said thats fine could you please comp my teas then.  I also explained the back waiter never mopped up the spilled tea that was all over one side of the table.  He just took the plate and cup and never wiped up the spilled tea.  I had to go to another table to get a chair to seat my child when he returned from the restroom because his side of the table was covered with tea.  So the waitress comes back and said she couldn't take off the teas because her boss gets really upset about that kind of thing once its already rung up. So my review is low and I will not go back.   Its a shame that I was so understanding and nothing was comp'ed.,negative
ts42,2/20/2011,revtest4548,4,"I had a huge, insurmountable craving for a salad slathered in Italian dressing last night. I was alone, so I did something kind of shameful...I set out to find the Olive Garden that was tucked away off of Independence Blvd. I found it, but much to my salad-craving chagrin, it was closed. Closed, gone the way of other Independence Blvd. businesses. So no unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks for me. 



I started thinking of where I might find some affordable, but good Italian food, and I remembered Portofino's. It's not in the nicest shopping center ever, but the food is really good, and the prices are very reasonable. For $13 or so, I got stuffed shells, a soda, crusty bread, and a delicious, delightful salad. I was pleased.



The servers were friendly, and the service was quick. There was no line to wait, either, even on a busy Saturday night...so it's a far better option than some of the ""fancier"" Italian restaurants. Yes, this shopping center is kind of creepy, but Portofino's is worth it.",positive

Expected very typical red-sauce place, but was happily surprised all around with quality of the food and variety!  Very friendly and attentive service, just what you'd hope for in a truly neighborhood place. Food was very good, two adults had pasta - linguine was high quality and cooked to al dente greatness, sauces were yummy, portions were (overly) plentiful. only suggestion for the Brasciola sauce was more peas!

I hadn't tried their other dishes until yesterday though, and if the pasta puttanesca and pasta with garlic and broccoli are any indication I need to start working my way through their menu pants size by pants size.



This location may not be in the most inviting shopping center but it is close to my home and my office and I generally pick up my food to go so really I'm not worried (besides, the police are a few doors down in the same strip mall).

Huge portions ( like 2 meals worth of leftovers huge)

Delicious specials



Although the pasta dishes looked fantastic, I opted for the Seafood Pescatore special. Risotto with a touch of marinara and laden with fruits from the sea - including a half filet of salmon on top.



It was divine as was the Ahi Tuna special served with a side of polenta with a creamy pepper sauce.



Delicious bread and decent wine list rounded out the dining experience.

For me, the food is much better here and so is the service. The first time I went here, I was picking up some pizzas to take back to the office.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a couple of Italian-Americans whipping up some crazy good pizzas.  The smell of the place told me that I was gonna love the pizza, and I did! 



So, my next visit was for a lunch meeting. We had a great waitress who kept our glasses filled and brought plenty of bread while we were waiting for our entrees.  



On my first dine-in visit, I had one of their specials -  it was chicken lasagne with a white sauce.  Man, was it good!  The portion was huge, so I  had a nice second meal!

I got penne pasta with their primavera sauce and it was so freaking good. Creamy, cheesy, perfect medley of flavors. The boyfriend got a cheesy red sauce concoction and really enjoyed it. We both had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day--win! Our server was AWESOME (wish I remembered her name, she deserves a shout-out). The pours of house wine were generous.

 On more than one occasion I have created dinner out of a slice of $2 cheese pizza and a tossed salad with their House dressing, that is hands down the best dressing in town. I have no idea what they put in it, but it keeps me coming back!

This is the ORIGINAL location in Charlotte, and far less crowded than the Park Rd. location.  And personally, I think the food is better.  



We began with an appetizer of roasted red peppers and sliced mozzarella.  There was lots of it, and it really hit the spot. All entrees come with a house salad.  I am in love with their house dressing.  It reminds me more of a creamy French meets Italian dressing.  For my entree, I ordered the the clams in a white sauce over linguine.  This is my go-to Italian dish.  It is overflowing with clam meat (or clam flesh? ew) and in a scrumptious white wine and butter sauce.  WAY too much for me to eat in one sitting.  Hello lunch for the next 2 days!

We had 25+ people with us and the restaurant was packed (always a good sign of delicious food). The staff was very accommodating and patient.



It was a Friday and I could not eat meat because of Lent. The waiter suggested the ""Mediteraneo,"" which is mixed seafood pasta in a creamy pink sauce. There is a selection of pasta types to choose from including Cappellini, Linguini, Fettuccini, Penne, or Spaghetti Noddles. I chose penne. This was HANDS DOWN, the most amazing pasta dish I have ever had! I am so sorry if you are not a seafood fan, but I'm sure this dish could sway you. I COULD NOT STOP EATING!! The waiter consistently asked how I liked my dish (since he recommended it), which was incredibly sweet. Overall: great food, great setting and great service!



As we left, I saw that they had Tiramasu on display (my all-time favoritteeee dessert!) so I HAVE to come back and try that! The Mediteraneo dish convinced me that everything else on the menu must be just as amazing! =)",positive

ts42,9/18/2012,revtest4570,5,"I had visited the Portofino's on Park Rd several years ago and wasn't wowed.  It was just okay Italian.  I also wasn't crazy about the atmosphere...or lack thereof.  



So when my partner suggested we try out the Portofino's on Eastway for lunch one day, I was very skeptical.  ""The rundown plaza in the sketchy part of town where even Walmart moved out of?"" was my response.  We went for lunch and I was literally blown away.  While the location and plaza it's in is suspect, walking into Portofino's, I felt much more assured.  It offered a nice, quaint atmosphere, much better than the one on Park Rd, I think.   We were immediately greeted by several smiling staff members and the dining room was already starting to fill up with people on their lunch breaks.  



Although Portofino's has a large authentic Italian menu with very reasonable prices already, we both opted for one of their equally reasonably priced lunch specials.  My partner had the mushroom ravioli with a reddish cream sauce.  I tried the sauce (I'm not a fan of fungi) and it was delicious and very flavorful.  I ordered the gnocchi special with tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic, and basil.  It, too, had a sauce that was oh-so-flavorable.  It wasn't exactly creamy, but close to it.  I absolutely loved it.  



We also ordered small Caesar salads to start (for not much more) and our server brought us some delicious warm bread that we finished up by sopping up our leftover sauces.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience and our server was super-efficient and very friendly.  I have a newfound respect for Portofino's on Eastway.

ts42,11/15/2012,revtest4572,4,"I was a little hesitant about this place based on its location in a generally depressing part of town, however I've eaten here twice now and have been taught a lesson about judging a restaurant by its strip mall. 



The owners and managers are an authentic Italian family, and it shows. I like to hear them talk from the kitchen but the noise level in the restaurant is comfortable and makes for easy conversation. I'm a sucker for pasta so the first time I went I ordered the manicotti--it was great but not too exciting (though how exciting can manicotti be, really?), but I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. The next time I had the tortellini alfredo and it was HEAVENLY--the sauce was perfectly creamy, the ham and onions fresh, and the pasta cooked perfectly. And the portion was HUGE! My partner got a large calzone and said it was also great but there was way too much of it, which is always a great complaint about a restaurant, if you ask me. Their dishes are fairly priced and possibly even a little underpriced considering the portions...bring your appetite!



The restaurant itself is small and a little dim, but seems clean enough. The service on my first visit was great, our server was very helpful and patient even though they were about a half hour from closing time. On my second visit we had a different server whom I suspect may have been new to the job, he was a little over-attendant and could never hear what we were saying, even though the restaurant was near-empty and quiet. He was nice, though, and they are very accommodating if you want to change something on the menu or have a specific request. 



I would definitely recommend Portofino's to anyone looking for authentic Italian cuisine, and I'm always looking forward to going back myself.

The dining area was nice and seemed inviting. Similar to the more authentic Italian places in the Washington, D.C. Area (where I'm from) the servers were a bit older, which was cool. Our server and food runners were very helpful an attentive, and gave excellent entree recommendations. The dining crowd that night consisted of mostly families and it was a lively bunch. 



The meal came with salad and bread. Both of which were fine. My entree (chicken Portofino) first of all was pretty huge and excellent!  I usually finish my entrees in restaurants, but I had to take it home. It was delicious that night and pretty darn delicious for lunch the next day too. The rest of our party enjoyed their meals as well. 



We also found the meal to be very reasonable. Not pricey at all. So oversll, the food was great, the service was great, and the price was great. I cannot wait to take my parents there when they visit. In fact, I can't wait that long, I'll be back there very soon! :)",positive

Portofino's has great pasta and I love their multiple veal dishes. 



Their house salad is loaded with green olives, strong on the vinegar, and definitely an acquired taste. I will admit that I have grown to love their salads, even though they're simplistic.

When I walked into Portofino, I felt like I was back in Westchester!  Slices on the counter, garlic knots....all of the good stuff.



I have not had the pizza, but have tried a few dinners.  The stuffed shells were awesome, and included a huge portion!  The chicken Parm was great, and again huge portion.  All meals are served with a salad (delicous homemade ""house"" dressing and a full small loaf of freshly baked bread.

It smelled amazing, and had that perfect non pretentious atmosphere that a good Italian place should have.  I ended up ordering the Tortellini Alfredo, and my special lady friend had the Chicken Sorrento.  Both were amazing.  It made the other Italian I've had in Charlotte look like Chef Boyardee.  It was difficult, but somehow we managed to reign back and save a little room for dessert.  We had the Cannoli, and the Tiramisu.  The filling in the Cannoli almost brought a tear to my eye.  The Tiramisu was a huge portion, and was some of the best I've ever had.  All in all I plan on this place being our go to Italian, and I can't wait to go back and try their pizza!",positive
ts42,6/18/2013,revtest4581,4,"I admit, I have lived reasonably close to Portofino's for almost 2 years and never once even seriously considered driving here.  Why, you may ask?  I have been told by many a person that you can't get decent, reasonably-priced Italian food here.  However, I can't imagine that the people who told me this had ever sat foot inside this little slice of paradise.



This place is flippin' awesome!  I rarely ever order or eat marinara sauce at restaurants; however, Portofino's has some of the best marinara I've ever eaten in my life.  It is such a perfect balance of flavors paired with high quality ingredients, without the need of complicated flavors to mask low-quality ingredients.  It's not too sweet, not too salty, and has a great tomato flavor.  On the first trip, I ordered the Chicken Sorrento, which included a large chicken breast.  Not only did the food taste fresh and flavorful, the portions were definitely big enough for dinner and plenty of leftovers for the next day.  My partner ordered the Tortellini Alfredo, which was very rich and satisfying.  For dessert, we ordered the cannoli and the tiramisu.  The filling in the cannoli was very rich and sweet, yet the shell was still crisp and not soggy.  The tiramisu was magical - the best I've ever had.  The marscapone was very smooth-tasting and the coffee flavor was not overpowering.  On the second visit, we ordered a pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.  Again, I loved the sauce, but the crust was a little too thin in places to hold up to the toppings.  I will definitely say they do NOT skimp on the toppings and cheese, which was super.  The sauce and crust were wonderful otherwise, and this is a pretty solid place to get pizza.  We also ordered the garlic knots, which were drizzled with buttery-oil mixture and garlic.  They were a little too small to adequately absorb all the flavors, but they were decent.



As for service and decor, this place is amazing.  Our waitress was so helpful and sweet to us, I just adored her.  While the plaza that houses this restaurant looks slightly (or moderately) questionable, this place is very open and nice-looking on the inside.  I loved the decor, with comfortable tables and an open look inside.  



I am sad I did not try this place sooner, but now that I know it's there, I have a bad feeling I'll be going there too often.  I may possibly dream of their marinara sauce tonight.",positive
ts42,7/1/2013,revtest4582,4,"I've been wanting to try out a new pizza place, but it makes it hard when I have Villa Francesca and Hawthorne's close by.  My friend told me about Portofino's, telling me it was his favorite spot for a NY style pie.  I gave them a call last Saturday night when we felt like staying in for the night.



Don't be disturbed by the shopping center it's located in.  It's one grungy, depressing area.  I already knew that ahead of time, so it didn't bother me.  There were a few guys behind the counter, but the bald guy with the heavy Italian accent was funny as hell.  He asked me about my day and if I had any plans for the 4th of July holiday.  I told him about my plans and he wished me well and to be safe.  I didn't really expect such a nice, warm greeting.  That's customer service!



The pizza was great too.  A perfect NY style pie.  I was just in NYC last month, so I've got street cred!  There's a reason this place has 4.5 stars.  I think this might be my favorite pizza in CLT now, but I need to try it out a few more times before I go that far.  I'm pretty sure I'll be bumping it up to 5 stars in the not too distant future.",positive

Food: Really reasonable prices for the huge portions of food. The quality of the pasta, tastiness of the sauces, ceasar salad fixings, and homemade bread were all amazing. Shrimp Parmesan gets two thumbs up. Split an appetizer, salad, bread, and entree and took home a full meal for leftovers. 



Wine: Selection was okay. Mostly 6/glass and 24/bottle, all Italian. The reds we got were tasty.

ts42,11/4/2013,revtest4587,5,"Stopped in for an early dinner on Saturday evening.  I had missed lunch and was starving.  I rarely get over to this part of town and it had been well over a year since I had visited.  So even though it was only 4:45 PM, I figured I would visit again.  So glad I did.



Even though it was so early, there were already a few tables filled and the carryout pizza was flying out the door.  By the time I left a little after 6:00, the place was pretty full.



I was promptly greeted and seated, and quickly attended to by my server Todd.  Great guy.  Very friendly.  His service was stellar.



I started with the appetizer special of a large Portobello mushroom cap stuffed with a crab filling and topped with a balsamic reduction and served over a bed of sautéed spinach.  Delicious. I followed with a entre special of Osso Bucco (did I spell that right?) with a side of Gnocchi.  Again, simply delicious.  



All in all, a terrific experience.  Great food and service, with a comfortable and quaint atmosphere.  I'll need to try harder to get over that way more often......",positive
ts42,11/8/2013,revtest4588,3,"Why is Italian food kind of hard to find in Charlotte? Plenty of Mexican places. After yelping some Italian joints I saw Portofino's come up with rave reviews. This place is right next to the Atlantic Farmer's Market. I've always assumed the whole strip mall stunk due to how it smells in Atlantic Farmer's Market, which is awful in case you were wondering. Portofino's is nice inside and doesn't really fit the area it is in but maybe that is what makes it special. We got salads to go with our carbs and asked for Italian dressing. Our server told us the house was their Italian but it was creamy and had egg yolks in it. Okay, game on. The dressing was pretty bland but with some salt and pepper I know it's got potential.



My date got the fettuccine primavera and I got the fettuccine casalinga. The caslinga is marinara, peas, and veal. I asked if I could opt out of the marinara for pink sauce since I've had an aversion to restaurant marinaras all my life. Our server allowed me to make the switch which was cool. I thought it was good on first bite but then began to realize how much cheese/cream/salt was in it. It was sickening by the third bite. The veal on it was tender and very good. My date wanted to switch plates but then realized how rich my dish was as well. His primavera was quite good and the broccoli in it seemed fresh. Both of our pastas were al dente. The primavera with my dish's veal would have made for some Optimus Prime level shit. I boxed the fettuccine caslinga up and added a half cup of water to it on the stove top the next day, it came out perfect. 



We also got garlic bread, and it was a lot (portion wise) for what we paid for but I kind of felt like I was eating carpet dust. No IN YOUR FACE garlic factor either. I wanted to order the clams casino but I was still weary of the fact that we were in a seedy strip mall. How good could seedy strip mall clams casino really be?



Honestly, give this place a shot. One of our pastas (primavera) was excellent and the other one would have been if the salt/cream was toned down a bit. Portofino's is kind of like the underdog kickball team, which makes them likable, but not the best. They just need a little more practice.",negative

I used to only order chicken alfredo which isn't even on the menu at Portofino's and the kitchen was always very kind to make it for me anyway. BEST ALFREDO SAUCE IN CHARLOTTE! Now I tend to order off the menu (garlic and broccoli with penne all day!!!) and eat on the leftover for at least two more meals.



I largely wanted to write this review in response to previously mentioned safety concerns for the area. I may be a bit biased because I grew up in this neighborhood and still visit it frequently, but I'm not sure where the fear comes from...I mean, this parking lot is shared with a police station... 

I'm a petite female in my twenties and I have never once felt unsafe or threatened here or across the street where the Ross is and I have visited that Food Lion on more than one occasion late at night. 

Please do not let your suspicions about the safety of the neighborhood keep you from this gem! I am always afraid that I will lose my favorite Italian Restaurant because they can't stay afloat on that side of town.

Most places that claim they have the best have garbage in my opinion. 





The service is really great as well, our server would come by every few minutes to check on us and we would chat with him for a good bit too. Dining in makes me feel I am in a Romano's to some extent. The subs are good, I generally would get the meatball one.",positive

They have a few key servers that have worked for them for several years.  If you're lucky enough to get one of them you will have phenomenal service.  If not, you may find yourself waiting for refills and such for longer than desired.  The pizza is about what you'd expect; typical ""New York Style"" pizza but quite greasy.  The bread served at the table is AMAZING and is even better if you ask for a side of their house dressing for dipping!  Trust me on this one!  I've tried a few other menu items beyond the pizza.  Some good, some not so good.  It all depends on your taste and familiarity.  Most dishes that I didn't like were the result of me branching out to try a little something new.  All in all, it's decent Italian food.  I was a little put off during my last trip by the servers attempt to ""charge"" for a refill of the bread basket for the table.

Our server was the nicest man!  He said, "" you look like a wine drinker,"" and offered me a sample of an Italian red that wasn't on the menu.  So good, and it was only $6.00!

My friend got the pasta fagoli soup, and a pasta dish featuring salmon.  I ordered the Gorgonzola tortellini minus the grilled chicken strips.  Our meals came with bread and salads, featuring some if the tastiest blue cheese dressing.  My plentiful dish was so good that I could have drunk the sauce if my manners were subpar.  My leftovers were boxed, and my husband will have a special lunch tomorrow.

We have been going here for years. It is a great, local Italian restaurant. The pizza is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (the quottro is our favorite). All of their pizza is delicious. The seafood pizza is surprisingly good. I honestly think this is probably the best pizza in Charlotte.



Go sometime for the other dishes- everything is good. Don't get sucked into thinking it is just pizza.



The owners/staff are warm, hilarious, hospitable and genuinely get to know you. We have had a good/ongoing rapport with most of the staff for years now. They treat us very well. If you become a regular- they will treat you like family.

Great bagel flavors, including several that they don't have at Panera. I like the Pumpernickel and the Jalapeno. Both are excellent. These are ""real"" bagels, unlike the stuff you might pick up a supermarket. They're made the right way, even if they aren't as good as New York. (Ha ha.)

I walked up to the counter and everyone was smiling and singing to the music, very happy to help and that is what will keep me coming back as a customer! I ordered the trio, by far the best deal on the menu...you get any bagel sandwich, soup or chips and a drink for $6.99. 



I chose the turkey chipotle (turkey and peppered bacon) on a rosemary and olive oil bagel with lettuce, jalapeños, onions and chipotle mayo. Toasted, of course with chips as my side. I asked that they make the bacon extra crispy and they were more than happy to oblige :) 



The sandwich was absolutely delish! Loved the rosemary and olive oil bagel and they piled on the toppings! The chips are all kettle cooked, my absolute favorite so I was clearly a fan!

This location's problems are mostly of its own making but the intense foot traffic only exacerbates them.



The bagels are usually acceptable but, compared to other locations, occasionally skimpy and/or undercooked.



Unfortunately, staff turnover at this store seems to be a way of life and through circumstance or choice they are shorthanded by at least one counter person every visit.  The predictable result is long waits.  Placing the coffee urns behind the counter means yet more delays as staff must do the pouring.  They've got plenty of room at the coffee/tea station and it's well past time to move the coffee urns out there even if it means hauling them back to make fresh coffee occasionally, just as Panera et al must do.

The sauce that went with it was okay, but not close to the chile relleno at Las Palmas in Santa Cruz. The taco looked like it needed a lot of love.

Two of the times we've been, we sat outside and enjoyed the breeze while we sipped margaritas. 



There's about a billion vegetarian options, which always works for me. I see Kelly C. didn't like her chile relieno, but I've always liked mine. I have a friend who lived in Texas for a while, so now she is kind of ruined for NC Mexican food...I've not gotten my taste buds retrained, however, so I am still a fan.



The patio is gorgeous, the staff is friendly and quick, and the food is good. I would recommend it to anyone, especially for dating!



It's easy to miss as you're coming down Harris, so make sure you get the directions straight if you don't know where you're going.",positive
ts44,11/8/2008,revtest4629,4,"I visit the Monterrey in the University about once a month during lunchtime.  People from work had always mentioned it, but from the outside, it doesn't look like much.  It's in a strip mall.  I decided to try it and once I got in there, I was amazed.  They've decorated and themed the inside of this strip mall restaurant very nicely to resemble a Mexican restaurant.  It's also divided into separate areas, making each a little more private.  I was impressed.



They bring you chips and salsa to start like any good Mexican restaurant.  They're nothing out of the ordinary, but they always taste so good to whet your appetite.  The salsa comes in a little decanter which you can then pour into your salsa bowl(s).  It's unnecessary, but the presentation of it is very nice.  



The food choices are your basic Mexican menu items.  I usually get one of the lunch combos.  For about $6, you can't go wrong.  It comes with a couple of choices, rice, and a side item.  My favorite is the combo with the soft chicken taco and chile relleno (which isn't really a stuffed chile, it's more of a pile of mush of cheese and very finely chopped chile, but oh-so-good), with a ""salad"" on the side consisting of shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and guacamole.  Yum.  



Like I said, the items are only about $6 a person and they really fill you up.  For a sit-down lunch restaurant, it's an awesome and delicious deal.",positive

I would, however, recommend Zapata's as an alternate.",negative

If you are looking for more traditional Mexican dishes, I would go somewhere else because Monterrey serves up the standard Tex-Mex favorites. Their margaritas are pretty tasty and you can get a super extra large one if you're really thirsty! Aside from that, the food is good and, more importantly, cheap...I always go for a quesadilla of some sort and I'd strongly recommend getting some queso for pre-dinner chip snacking!",positive

Pollo Fundido, taco salad, sopa de pollo, chicken taco, and the cheese sauce are great choices! You won't go home hungry, you could probably eat for a few days if you take home left overs. 

I used to eat here every Sunday, but I moved due to work. If you are in the area and want a great deal on a lot of good food, this is the place to go.

ts44,6/7/2010,revtest4633,5,"I will begin this review by saying I bought my first condo based on it's close proximity to this particular Monterrey's.  I'm not sure if that's sad or a good move on my part.  The old school Charlotteans will remember this as the former site of the famous (in my heart at least) Rainbow Deli.  Monterrey has done a great job over the last seven or so years making this reborn location a fun hangout with unbeatable service and food that I constantly crave.



It's not often I take my little ""Mini-Me"" out in the evenings- At the end of the day, I'm not mentally prepared for toddler-sized meltdowns before the food arrives.  Monterrey is always the exception to this rule.  Our plates come out so darn quickly, and in the meantime, there are several waiters to come by and make funny faces at her to pass the time!  Although I haven't lived in the area for several years, they still know me by name and I'm treated like family as soon as I walk in.  I used to think I was just special, but I've heard several people with the same experience.



I've had almost everything on the menu, but the Cheese Steak Burrito is my ""Old Faithful.""  Their Sangria is pretty remarkable and the margaritas are decent.  The best part:  The Dos Equis drafts are so cold, the ice particles form on the outside of the glass- Delightful.  My absolute favorite is meeting friends on their substantial, covered deck with some cheese dip and cold beers.  I've had birthday parties here, bridal showers, etc. and they are completely hospitable to everything.

Maybe a little below average. I'd probably give it a 2 or 2.5 for what I had. My server was very attentive and the food came out fast though. The main reason I have no reasons giving the place a solid 3 is because I think it could be better than my experience. They have plenty of authentic Mexican dishes which you don't normally see outside of Cali. Normally, I would have gotten one of these but was feeling like Fajitas.

So my sister had informed me that this place had received pretty decent reviews on here and I thought I would try it out. So my overall consensus is that it's not as good as Azteca but its good!! 



We started out with the queso that came out so quickly and was very good! I had the the Arroz Con Camerones the shrimp had good flavor as did the guacamole it came with, it was just missing something. My boyfriend had the Ribeye which came with rice and beans and grilled onions and peppers with fried potatoes and he seemed to like it.

The narrow strip of parking spots doesn't accommodate everybody when it's a Friday night. I actually tried eating here this past Friday but we couldn't find a parking spot anywhere, so we left.



Luckily for them I've eaten here many times so I will return! The food is good, and all at a very reasonable cost. Queso dip is always a great way to start, along with the margaritas. Both always tasty and delightful! Strawberry frozen is my recommendation :) The food has usually been good for me and the waitstaff is always pretty quick with service. I usually get chicken quesadilla with queso cheese, yum! When I order take out, they always pack plenty of rice. If you're craving Mexican, this is a great place to go.",negative

Has great lunch specials and it is super fast (so you can enjoy your lunch without having to watch the clock too much).  Chips and salsa were kept on the table - The salsa has a medium kick to it (just right) and I can pretty much down a whole basket of chips myself (SAD, but true).



From Harris, the place doesn't look that big, but it really opens up inside and they have some pretty wicked decor inside.... some of the booths have a false thatched covering over them and the decor always seems festive.",positive
ts44,6/23/2011,revtest4641,3,"Monterrey - the regional chain - is quite possibly the first Mexican food that I ate in Charlotte.  Whether it was or not, it is the first I remember having.  I typically eat at the location in Matthews, simply because it is closer to my house.



As has been mentioned by other reviewers, this spot is a bit funky.  While you can see it from Harris, it is almost always in a ""oh, there is Monterrey"" discussion, so that you are passing by going one way or the other and it is nearly always too late to figure out just how to get into the parking lot.



Should you happen to figure it out, then the food is not bad, and pretty similar to the other location in Matthews - fairly standard, perhaps skewing to the high end, Americanized Mexican fare.  While there are better stops in Charlotte for Mexican food, there are plenty that are worse as well, so try and find your way into the parking lot and give Monterrey a try!",negative

I love that this place has all of the good Mexican menu standards done well; but what makes this restaurant really good is that they go the extra mile to set the scene for your meal.

So much food for your money, and great, personable service too.",positive
ts44,9/12/2011,revtest4644,4,"I eat here quite often.  It isn't great Mexican food, but it is pretty good and the best in the neighborhood.



One plate I would like to recommend is El combo.  It comes with a LOT of food.  I usually only eat half and save the other half for lunch the next day.  It all comes with beef but you can sub chicken for any item at a cost of $0.25.  The hard taco and the Chalupa are best eaten that night.  The chili rellano could have more pepper in it.  



The margaritas are hit or miss.  Sometimes they will be strong and sometimes they will be a little weak.  On Mondays medium margaritas are $5.50 and they are pretty good sized.  I think on Thursdays they have beer on special.  



If it is your birthday, they let you wear a sombrero and give you a fried flour tortilla with a whip cream smiley face on it.  It may come with some syrup and a cherry too.  You do not get to keep the hat like I thought, they will chase you down and ask for it back.",positive

They have raised their prices quite a bit and taken the kids' special off the menu for Sunday lunch.  We were the first customers yesterday and the chips were burnt.  We asked for a new basket and they were a tiny bit better.  We asked for mild salsa and it came out like tomato juice.  Usually by 11:30 on a Sunday there are quite a few customers in there but when we left at 11:45 or so we were still the only people there.  The food was not bad and I have always thought their chicken was the best around but I am so dissappointed.  We have too many other choices for Mexican to spend that kind of money when we can get the same or better for much less.  We know we can get better chips elsewhere.

The location isn't anything special. If you're coming from Harris Blvd. you will mostly likely miss the turn and will have to swing back around. As for Charlotte/ North Carolina chain restaurants, this Mexican joint is a personal fave. 

While the food isn't authentic Mexican it will satisfy your craving. 

Their queso dip and margs are pretty tasty. The menu is quite extensive- usually I just grab a taco or burrito, but they have many other options.

The first time everything was delicious ,and the carnitas were to die for!  It was my favorite thing and I honestly couldn't stop eating it.



The second time, we were served some strange cut of pork that honestly made my stomach turn.  It was very fatty and honestly tasted spoiled.  We mentioned it to our server, stating how it was very different our first experience, and she just looked rather confused.  We both got sick to our stomachs and could not finish our meal.  And honestly, I couldn't fathom eating Mexican again for a few weeks, when it's my favorite kind of food!

ts44,5/10/2013,revtest4654,3,"I usually go to Monterrey around lunchtime. Sitting outside in the nice cool breeze, drinking a refreshingly large Margarita out of one of their fishbowl-sized glasses, is usually the setting for my visits to this Mexican eatery. Rarely do I go for the festive ""Mexi-Charlotte nightlife"". I decided to try out their dinner-time demeanor. Granted it was during Cinco de Mayo (which ponders a question....Do yo think Mexico celebrates Fourth of July with fireworks and Jack & Cokes or Vodka & Redbulls?....Anyways...) so I kept that in mind when formulating my review here.

     I believe the food at Monterrey to be some of the best bang for your buck when it comes to Mexican food. I have eaten similar items prepared IN Mexico and it is quite comparable. They started us out with chips and salsa (probably one of my favorites) and drinks (for Cinco de Drinko, I went with a house Margarita out of a red Solo cup). Atmosphere was enjoyable and festive with a live DJ for this auspicious Mexican occasion, everyone seemed to be having a good time. That is, until the food came.

     Luckily for this Ginger getting his Mexican on, his order was accurate. The same can't be said about other folks in the group. Some getting guacamole when they opted out, others glaring at the ones who got it in envy. Then when asked for refills on chips and salsa, our table watched in horror as they picked up a mini-carafe and bowl of chips from a table that had just cleared. We politely, but sternly, declined the gently used basket of chips and salsa. What was going on?

     I generally rate Monterrey 4-5 stars in my books, albeit Cinco de Mayo, some qualities you just don't sacrifice. It seemed the service and quality was sacrificed that night a bit amidst the festivities. I will go back there, but I believe it will be for my Enchiladas and Fishbowl Margaritas from here on out.",negative

ts44,7/9/2013,revtest4657,1,"This place has REALLY gone down hill as of late. It used to be semi-decent. Tonight's visit was a nightmare. Took the whole family there. Typical last minute decision, tired kids, grumpy spouse. The chips were stale and over cooked, or double cooked. The wife got the giant margarita. It was so syrupy tasting that she couldn't get more than two sips out of it. At the end of the meal I took it back to the bar and told the manager it was totally awful. He didn't understand my English so the rest of the conversation had to take place in Spanish. He did offer to put more booze in it, but the taste was the part she couldn't stand. I asked him how they made it, he pointed to the uniform shape and size row of bottles and said, ""just this mix and tequila"". No limes, no fresh ingredients. There was nothing that could come from that bar that would have sufficed. It was just bad. 



I got the burritos verdes. They are a new item, beef tips in a burrito. Not awful really. But the burrito was mostly beans, with just a hint of beef in it. Wife got the fish tacos. They were too salty for her (or anyone) to finish, so I swapped meals with her and poured hot salsa all over them and just ate em down. They were NOT good. The ""special sauce"" that they serve with the fish tacos ended up just being generic thousand island dressing. I took a bite of some of the kids meals too. The burrito meat my toddler was pushing away all night had the texture of wet sand. It was so overly salty as to be almost inedible and the taste was horrendous. 



The service was pretty lame too. One waiter came bringing four plates and after about five minutes of trying to decide who's was who's we finally had to explain to him that none of these orders were ours and he was at the wrong table. So he takes 3 of the 4 plates away and leaves the 4th one for about 10-15 minutes while the customer who ordered it waited confused. It was really slow in there too, maybe 6 other people in the whole restaurant.



The manager walked by the table about a half dozen times never stopping to check on us, and I don't think our drinks were refilled the whole night. We didn't bother to complain  because it was already a bit of a rough night for us and we just didn't need the drama. So in all fairness, I didn't really give them much of a chance to redeem themselves. But honestly, if EVERYTHING that you send from the kitchen to the house comes out bad, service, entrees, drinks, chips, booze I don't think a polite complaint could have done us any good.



If you're a college student at the nearby UNCC and want a hole in the wall to drink beer at while watching t.v. or chatting it up on the patio with friends, this place will work.

ts45,12/20/2008,revtest4668,4,"Villa Antonio is one of those places that can go in a number of directions, so you may have to cross your fingers when you go through the door.  I've been at least three times, and each time has been completely different.



To the credit of the restaurant, the last time was the best - so it is possible that you could say that they are getting better.  It's also possible that you could say that they are just hit-and-miss.  I'll leave that call up to you.



The first time I went, we arrived when they were busy, and the only seat that they had was next to the kitchen.  The place was packed, and we had not reservations, so it was good that we had a seat at all.  As you might expect, however, sitting next to the kitchen wasn't a good idea.  Also, being there when they were busy also wasn't good.  It was a bit of a zoo in there.



On the second visit, we went at lunch to the buffet, which wasn't impressive at all.  While service was better and the overall experience was improved, the food just wasn't that great.  Unlike some, I don't mind a good buffet, but this one wasn't.



Most recently we went just before the dinner rush - and we weren't even dressed appropriately - and had our pick of seats.  It's also worth mentioning that this was after they remodeled the place.  Service had improved quite a bit, we weren't sitting next to the kitchen and everything was much, much better.  By the time we were done it was even well into what we would expect to be a dinner rush, and the place was still nearly empty.  So I wonder if perhaps something has changed.  We might have to drop in again to see.



I don't know if they somehow managed to figure out that I wrote this - though I can't imagine how they would do that - but they sent me a gift card (just $5, but a gift card is a gift card).  I don't recall signing up for anything, but maybe I did at some point.  Who knows?",positive
ts45,6/15/2009,revtest4669,4,"Found this place while driving outside the airport before I had to catch a flight. Was tired of eating at the usual places in the airport, so ventured out and found a good meal.  I got there ~5:30 on a Friday, so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too stuffy, and the staff courteous and attentive.



I perused the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, ribeye w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, complimentary tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the entree. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some parts and tiramisu was good  though espresso was faint if there at all.



Overall, I thought this was a very good deal for the food, service and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well worth it.",positive

We nibbled on the Bruschetta while deciding what to order.  The menu seemed to have many options and it all sounded good.  I got the Lobster Bisque to start off with, and what a horrible choice.  It came out lukewarm, overly fishy smell (almost like dead fish--yuck!) and completely inedible.  The presentation made me salivate, but I came to my senses after the 2nd bite.  Couldnt even think of the 3rd bite. Im hoping there was something wrong that specific day with this soup, cause Lobster Bisque anywhere else is delightful.

For the entree I got some kind of pasta with shrimp, sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese.  Im not lying when I say I can make an amazing pasta dish that would put this one to a crying shame.  It was awful, tasteless and just a waste of (alot) of money.  The dish had tiny chunks of canned tomatoes! That gross can taste was such a turn off, I ate all 2 bites and took the rest home to give my mom a good laugh.  And boy did she laugh.

We did have dessert though, off a huge machine looking cart.  I had creme brulee and it was the saving grace of this restaurant (also the reason they got 2 stars).  Also the in-between palate cleansers were good too.  I wish they would serve that as dessert!  

My sister decided to pay for my dinner (how nice) and our total came to be $128.00!!  For crap food!  I felt so bad for her......but Ill make it up to her someday :)",negative

ts45,5/1/2010,revtest4672,5,"Been to this place a few times.  From the beginning of this year, every last Tuesday of the month, a salsa dance use the bar area to hold a free class at 7:30pm then social party till 11:00 pm.  During such time, wine is half price abt $3.50 - $4 or $5.-  They have good collections of wine and they use classic wide wine class with a generous portion.  I love that.

Then their appetizers are also half price.  Really great.  Beer is abt $2.00 or $2.50.  Whisky is a little more.  Still affordable.

They have good food and the atmosphere is above average.  Better dress up a little before you go.

They recently have many features and special.  Check that out if you are interested for a nice dinner in couple or party.  Love this place too.",positive
ts45,6/18/2010,revtest4673,4,"I have always passed my this place and had never stopped in until and ex was wanted to try them and boy was i glad we did. As you walk in you are taken away from the hustle and bustle of being on South Blvd, and is kinda taken to a different place. The decor is very nice and upscale. I must admit they were a little pricey but in my opinion they were will worth it, The portions are huge and they are enough to feed two people. The staff is amazing and are willing to go the extra mile to make sure your happy and that everything is going great. The night we went the owner was there and offered free drinks and I'm down for a free drink anytime.. lol but over all i would rate this a 4 out of 5",positive
ts45,9/29/2010,revtest4674,4,"This place was recommended to us by a neighbor after our disastrous meal at Mama Ricotta's. We had driven by many times and, from it's exterior, gave it a pass because of it's Olive Garden-like vibe.



Actually, inside, it's a nice old-school Italian feel to it. There is a bar with live music and tables on one side and a dining room on the other. We showed up on a Friday night without reservations and got a table easy.



My husband and I always judge a new Italian restaurant by it's Chicken Parmesan, a classic entree.  It's like a turkey club sandwich -- if you somehow eff it up, I am not interested in your more complicated dishes. There parm was very good: not too much cheesy gunk and nicely cooked and spiced. I had a veal chop that was out of this world. 3 days later when I ate the microwaved leftovers it was still delicious!



They have a dessert cart that they roll table-side. Out server tried to steer us away from a couple of options, which I appreciate. The desserts we tried were fine, but not stellar -- an ordinary bread pudding and cheesecake.



At the end of the meal one of the staff handed me a hand-written coupon for $20 off our next meal, which was a nice touch.



It's a bit spendy, but the overall experience was worth it and we will probably take my parents here when they visit next month.",positive
ts45,10/1/2010,revtest4675,4,"The hubby and I had a restaurant.com coupon that brought us to Villa Antonio.  I didn't read any reviews for this place before we went and based on the location I assumed the restaurant wouldn't be too upscale.  To my surprise this place was pretty fancy.  When we first walked in the host was a bit of a jokester.  He made a few comments about taking care of the pretty lady as he kissed my hand (creepy??) and left Mr. P to take care of himself. 



 Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful, almost to the point of being bothersome when we were in the middle of a conversation.  He would end up standing at our table talking to us about the food for what sometimes seemed like an excessive amount of time.  At least he was thorough. 



The food was pretty good.  I had angel hair pesto with shrimp and a side of asparagus and portobello mushrooms.  The hubby had the lobster ravioli with shrimp.  I didn't enjoy my pasta as much as I enjoyed the lobster ravioli, but that's just personal preference.  However, the asparagus and mushrooms were delicious!  The asparagus was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of seasoning and the mushrooms melted in my mouth.  We followed everything up with a strawberry shortcake dessert that was delightful.  



I don't know if the food is worth the money, but what you're really paying for is the whole dining experience.  The servers are on top of everything and they like to make the whole evening a show.  They will describe all of the daily specials and give recommendations for wine pairings.  When they bring out your entree plate it has a silver dome cover on top that they rattle around on the plate for dramatic effect before revealing the contents inside.  The whole evening was quite entertaining.  I believe this is the first time I've ever had the waiter shake my hand at the end of the meal.  It's definitely a great place to go on a first date.  



We'll be back to try out some other entrees since I was slightly disappointed in my pasta.",positive
ts45,10/1/2010,revtest4676,4,"Service was outstanding. From the moment we walked in, we were immediately greeted and escorted to our table, It was as if someone had called them and told them we were coming and we would most likely be writing a review (or two) on our experience. Or you know how when the bigwigs of your company are going to stop by and everyone has to pretend to love their job and work a little harder? That's what it felt like, which was a good thing. 



As always at any restaurant, i am a big fan of complementary food without ordering (like all Mexican restaurants chips and salsa). Bruschetta was served when we were seated and even though it wasn't really my favorite thing, i was much obliged. Also served was some awesome i-can't-remember-the-name bread. Yes we will have another round of free yet delicious bread please.  

 

i don't do wine, but the list looked extensive. Had it been a beer list, i would've been giddy.  



i was really craving some good old fashion lasagna, but couldn't resist the lobster ravioli served with some mushrooms and 3 obese shrimp. Turned out to be a delicious choice. As a side we ordered the portobello mushrooms and asparagus. The shrooms were perfect and the asparagus were good. Will definitely get that side again. 

For dessert, i ventured outside of my chocolaty coated, chocolate filled comfort zone and tried the strawberry shortcake. Another excellent choice. Either i happened to select every delicious thing on their menu or this place may be pretty solid across the menu. 



i have to mention that in the midst of this fancy Italian meal, the lights go out and out they come with an anniversary cake singing Happy Anniversary (to the tune of Happy Birthday) to a couple there celebrating their anniversary. It was very TGI Fridays like. i'm still not sure if i approve or not. i suppose it made me feel better about being in jeans, although when placing our drink orders we felt like we were almost frowned upon when we didn't order any wine.   



Even with the $25 restaurant.com certificate, we still spent a pretty penny and in the end, i value my cash more than i need royal treatment, so i'd be content with the Olive Garden unless i need to impress. It makes me doubt my math skills when the tip alone approaches the cost of most of our meals out.",positive
ts45,10/31/2010,revtest4677,4,Stumbled in here during a storm. The food was excellent but prepare for a calorie splurge.  Would have liked to try the desert but had no room.  The service was old fashioned and first class.,positive

If it seems out of your price range, I would suggest, if possible, to save up for a special night out.",positive
ts45,4/27/2011,revtest4679,1,"Sorry for my comment tonight. I'm speaking from my personal experience only. 

Having been here for quite a few months. Came back from oversea This afternoon. They normally has special price on drinks & appetizers every last Tuesday night with dancing party. I did receive a email about that special sometime last week.  I went there with my partner thinking they  had the discount. However, when I asked the waiter if they have special discount, he said he would ask the manager without telling us clearly. Therefore, I thought I was going to order some appetizers before we order entree. Nevertheless, we decided just to order three appetizers and two house red wine.

I was thinking if there were special price, I could order something that was on regular price to balance off their special discount because I'm also a business person, didn't want to take every advantage. I asked if they have Bordeaux as commonly known red wine but the waiter brought me white wine.  He came back said they  did not have Bordeaux so I asked for Pinot noir and a dessert.

As a result, our bill was $88.- . I even found that two wines cost $27.- Holly Molly, what?????  then he said they did not have special.  Wooow, if I've to pay that price, I didn't have to sit there where other people coming to dance & took my seat whenever I got up to a dance or to bathroom.  Presentation of food was OK but quality did not match with the price.

As I was with a guy friend and didn't want to make him feel bad. I only commented with another friend who went there for the party & a couple of drink only. He said he would never eat there as the food wasn't worth the price. He's right. for half the price, I would take it but not the full price. Or I could have better quality and service. No wonder it was not as crowded as it used to be.

I felt I had been deceived.  I went home and found the email about the half price of wine and appetizers and special on beer.  I sent them a email with no respond.  Good bye and good luck, cheater  Villa Antonio.",negative
ts45,6/28/2011,revtest4680,2,"This place is defenetly overrated and overpriced. Because of this I decided to go with the $30.00 Three Course Entree Dinner. The service was good I will say that.  The restaurant is ""Romantic"" that you get to see couples Kissing in their boots and singing to their signinficant other/spouse when the pianist is playing. I am not a big fan of people making out while I am eating.



But the food was below par,

My first choice was:

ALCACCIA

Italian Sausage Topped with Melted Mozzarella and Marinara Sauce-

Which was the best item out of the 3. The tomato sauce was really good



PENNE & CHICKEN

Penne Pasta Tossed with Grilled Chicken and Broccoli and Finished in a Vodka Pink Sauce - This entree is just not good the pasta was overcooked and it did not seem to me that the pasta was hand made. It really felt that it came from a grocery store.



RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE - I will agree with someone that posted something stating that the CHEESECAKE might have come from a different place because it was actually good.



The quality is not that great; if you are paying $25+ For just an entree with no salad / soup included it better be good.



Anywho thats my 2 cents. I would not come back here again.",negative

This is a must visit while in Charlotte!",positive
ts45,7/21/2011,revtest4682,4,"My husband and I really enjoyed this place.  It is more expensive than most places, and yes, you probably could find the same dish elsewhere for ten bucks less.  But you know how much the food costs before you go there. 



My husband's father owned a couple over restaurants and was born and raised in Sicily.  So needless to say, he knows Italian food.  That being said, we were not disappointed.  I thought the food was great and the portions were big.   I got the Osso Bucco.  The veal was fall off the bone good.  And they left the bone marrow, which most restaurants don't do.  



I also really liked the atmosphere.  Its felt like something more classic, traditional.  And it was intimate.  The wait staff was also great.

The wife and I had a great dinner before going to a local jazz concert.  Fresh focaccia with balsamic EVOO dip....and the fresh bruschetta....all so very good.  The lemon sorbet with extra dry brut provided the best palate cleanser!!  And the wine selection is always amazing!!  We had a great pairing of delicious red wine....(Yes RED goes well with everything) and our waiter never asked our preference!!  Why....because that is how good they are with pairing!  Dinner was great...the dishes are always well prepared and so so so full of flavor.  And the portions are so great...you have to think a minute before you decide on the tiramasu or other wonderful dessert ...or do I just get a box and take some home!

ts45,9/15/2011,revtest4685,4,"Villa Antonio is kind of like a tamale; corny on the outside, delicious on the inside. When I first spotted this restaurant upon moving to Charlotte, I couldn't help but notice the out of place exterior on South Boulevard. The sign is a little dorky and it looks like some crazy Italian villa...next to a Walgreens. The interior, however, has a very romantic italian feel with low lighting and candles on the tables. From the moment we arrived, and before we even walked through the door, the service was incredible. We were promptly greeted by the owner (who kissed my hand, yes, really) and one of the managers who opened the doors. We were seated immediately and didn't have to wait long for our server to take our drink order. The wine selection is immense and takes a while to get through, but our server was good about checking back with us without being a pest. After we finally decided, we were presented with one of the best bruschettas I've ever had. It was seriously good and seriously gratis. I love little touches like that at restaurants, they really set the place apart. We thought that was great and didn't even expect bread, but after ordering our food, we got more delicious treats in the form of warm foccacia with yummy ""italian butter"" (balsamic and EVOO). 



We couldn't decide what to order because everything looked so good, but we finally went with the beef wellington and this ""purse pasta"" (sacchietta maybe??) that was filled with cheese and proscuttio in a delish sauce. We let the server know we wanted to share them, so maybe needed a small plate. He said he would let the chef know and see what he could do. The beef wellington takes a while to prepare (menu says 30 minutes) and while we were waiting the service continued to be stellar. The owner, the manager and our server took turns refilling our wine glasses and water and making sure we were still doing well.



After about 30 minutes, our food was presented under silver domes (so fancy!). The server pulled off the lids to reveal that the chef had already split the entrees between the two plates and even prepared TWO smaller beef wellingtons! I couldn't believe the trouble the went to to prepare two separate entrees for us. Even after being divided, the portions were still HUGE! The only reason I can't give this review 5 stars is because the beef was a fair amount over, but I will note that beef wellington is very hard to not overcook. And it was delicious anyway...



Overall, this is a really great place. The prices are a bit high for the food, but the ambiance is good and the service is outstanding. Definitely a great spot for a night out with your special guy or gal.",positive
ts45,9/22/2011,revtest4686,4,"I have been to the Villa ANtonio restaurant in Ballantyne many times.  I typically get the Chicken Parmesan, always delicious.  I have gotten the fired calamari every time I have been in there, it's always delicious.  The fried calamari is the real deal, barely any rings (if at all).  As for the South Boulevard location.  Today was my first trip there for lunch.  They had the lunch buffet.  The lunch buffet was excellent.  Good variety, including a salad bar, 3-4 types of pasta (Penne Carbanara, cheese ravioli, ziti w/spinach andd sausage, and a pasta with seafood) , chicken marsala, meatloaf, and minestrone soup.  Other reviewers have said the buffet items change.  Service was also excellent.  The cost was also very reasonable, only $9.99.  I plan to eat here weekly now.",positive

It was not.  The Caesar salad was ""made"" table side.  Or so they pretended.  Lettuce in a bowl tossed with cheese at your table sans egg or anchovy is a side salad.  Caesar was far from hailed. Dry.  Inedible, 



It all comes down to your personal preferences and standards If you are not Italian, have never been to Italy or have never been fed by an Italian, you might like the food.  You might also like Chef Boyardee.  I give this restaurant 1 star because I have to on this site.

The ambience of this place is perfect for business and it seems like it would be a good date spot as well.  The only negative I had was that I deviated from the buffet once and tried the Villa Sinatra.  Which is a filet mignon sandwich on ciabatta.  It was really friggin good, but it didnt seem like super tender filet that I am used to.

You get several nice additions at no-charge including a lemon sorbet with Veuve champagne pallet cleanser and a small piece of bruschetta. The former was delicious the latter a pale comparison of their actual bread which is served warm and has a beautiful light rosemary flavor. 



We were heavily up-sold on everything we ordered. We wanted two glasses of Malbec...not a bottle... yes were absolutely-positively sure. My boyfriend wanted the chicken Parmesan but was told no and told to get something else (the server literally took the menu from his hand and picked out another meal).  My bf appreciated his pushiness ...I did not and felt a bit uncomfortable explaining that he did in fact know what he would like to eat for dinner.  I will say other than that he was very attentive and overall a good server who just needed to tone it down a bit. 



Most meals are in the high 20's to 30's range. I went with the lobster ravioli which was ok but next time I would steer clear of the pasta. Let me say I am picky when it comes to pasta and I make quite a bit of it at home. I felt their Béchamel  was  flour-heavy and lacked flavor. Portions are quite big so you will not leave hungry.

My only complaint was that it was pricey. Two people, bottle of wine, small appetizer, shared salad, two entrees, and desert-  $110. Given that was more than your average dinner, but you should expect to pay in upwards around $20-30 for most of their entrée items, before tax and gratuity. 



I will say in the grand scheme of things, you really are paying for the upscale qualities of food, service, and atmosphere here- and they can really pull this off. As for myself, I may only eat here once in a blue moon. Great for special occasions and dinners on your company's tab!",positive

My boss's favorite type of food is ""a lot"", so he tries to force us to go to a buffet every year.  Normally, since I am the one who coordinates the outing and I am not a fan of standing in line for and then carrying my food, we do not go to a buffet.  This year, he won out and we did a lunch buffet, and that was a good thing!



I called Villa Antonio ahead of time and spoke to a very friendly young woman on the phone (Rebecca, I believe) who I made the reservation with.  She explained that we wouldn't be in our own room, but we would be sectioned off for ""semi-private"" dining.  Good enough.  I reminded all of my group ahead of time to please wear a shirt and shoes to work that day and upon inspection we could be seen in public so off we went.  



Villa Antonio is located near the intersection of South and Woodlawn (located directly across the street from the Home Depot that my group worked on, so we go to see a jobsite as well).  The parking looks like it is going to be sketchy if you look at the front of the building, but there is plenty of parking behind the building (you can also go next door to Pier 1 and walk off some of the carbs when you are done).



Our group of 17 arrived in groups of 3 or so and we were taken to a room towards the back that was cordoned off by a black curtain.  We weren't all crammed in together and all had ample room to maneuver to the buffet as well as eat. Drink orders were promptly taken and kept refilled.  Fresh, warm delicious bread was put on the table with dipping oils.  



The buffet doesn't have a huge selection, which is a good thing as that means items are turned quickly and don't sit out.  The day we went there was a small salad section, lasagna, a chicken pesto pasta, meatballs, chicken something, roasted veggies, a cheesy potato casserole type dish and some other items (I was full after my first pass so I don't recall every item).  All of the items were hot and tasted fresh.  The potato casserole was delicious, as was the lasagna and and the chicken pesto pasta.  Another large group came in behind us, so waiting in line became a bit tedious for others, but I would think during the average day any other time of year that it wouldn't be packed to the rafters will people.



A dessert tray was brought out, but most of us were stuffed and needed to get back to the office to meet a deadline, but the desserts looked good as well.

Let me start by saying the staff were extremely attentive and accomodating (though borderline suffocating at times) but it was also a Wednesday evening before restaurant week so perhaps it was abnormally quiet.  



We weren't planning to have wine with dinner but couldn't resist when they told us it was 1/2 priced bottles night.  We had a tasty Malbec and for half price it was a great deal!



The food was good.  Is is bad I don't really know what else to say than that?  I had a pasta dish with a variety of shellfish in a vodka sauce and my fiance had the chicken parmesan .  Everything I would say was average - portions were plentiful, food was flavorful but nothing really wowed me.  Had I not had the Yelp deal I imagine I would have been a little disappointed in paying $28 for a pasta dish that was just good.  



With that being said, I will file this restaurant in the ""Wouldn't choose to return but would be fine with someone suggesting we go there"" section of my dining rolodex.  For what it's worth, I think there is much better food (particularly Italian) at other places that can offer the same dining experience at half the price.",negative
ts45,2/4/2013,revtest4704,1,"My first 1-star review... there was absolutely nothing about this place that was even average.  Here's my breakdown:



1. Ambiance - cheesy... no, super cheesy.  Like a bad Christmas sweater that is not worn ironically.



2. Food - awful... the salad was soggy from wilted lettuce, the calamari was like deep fried rubber, the pasta was bland and the veal was like eating beef jerky covered in cream sauce. Think you can't screw up tiramisu? Think again. Awful.



3. Wine - horrible... the wines offered by the glass were like what you might find on closeout at a flea market. There were a few halfway decent Italian wines offered by the bottle, but at 3-4x the retail price.  With so many good options to build a great Italian wine list (see Vivace for a good example), this was bottom of the barrel and I really know my Italian wines. Very disappointing.



4. Service - suffocating... must have had someone come over every 5 minutes and there were at least 4 different folks hovering around us.  When the waiter came by I felt like I was at a used car lot with a salesman getting paid to ""upsell"" me at every opportunity.



I do not give out 1-stars often... same as my 5-stars, but this was just plain bad.  Think we ended up spending $115 on dinner for two, didn't get any wine by the bottle (just a few glasses) and walked out of there feeling like we just got robbed.",negative

After I purchased it, I realized that the coupon said it was for the South Blvd location, but it was listed as South Blvd, Ballantyne. The manager went ahead and let us use our coupon, but there was some major confusion and he took my iPhone for about 10 minutes.



We ordered appetizers, soup/salad and shared an entree. Our entree was supposed to be a chicken dish and it came out as a pasta that had a similar name. It was good, but not really enough to share with 2 people like the meat dish would have been. I suspected the waiter had just heard me wrong, but the bill came out for the chicken dish. I should have objected, but I didn't because they had already let us use our coupon.

I went for the salmon which is covered with crab meat, so I was already excited upon ordering... lol The asparagus and potatoes were great and they had a champagne sauce that was absolutely awesome... I loved the salmon; it was flaky and delicious!  



I thoroughly enjoyed the Pineapple Martini... Just the right balance of tart and sweet... Phenomenal... 



I was kind of sad that I didn't have enough room left for dessert that night because they all looked like good choices, but alas... No sweets for me... 



The second time, we went through for the lunch buffet... That was some good stuff!  Salad bar with lots of fresh toppings and ample dressing selections... A soup option and eight entrée possibilities made for a great trip through the Villa Antonio catalog... I was not a fan of pesto before I tried this one... The sauce on the linguini was top notch... I loved the roasted chicken which looks just as good as it tastes...

They highlighted their Osso Bucco, and I don't think I've ever had Osso Bucco before, so I was sold (plus the line about ""slowly braised for 8 hours"").  It was honestly one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten, and I don't say that easily.  Velvety, rich, tender, and just freaking delicious, served over risotto.  Oh man.  We got a side of spinach to go with it, and a bottle of pinot noir.  We finished off with the mousse (not really my thing, but I was pretty full from dinner).

We arrived at 7:00 and stood at the door as no one was there to greet us. After almost 10 minutes I grabbed a waiter who informed the maître de. He seated us in a booth and left, no menus?? After 10 minutes we were brought complimentary bruschetta, which was very nice. A waiter approached to take our drink order, still no menus. Finally our waiter brought menus and told us about the specials.

After receiving our drinks, we chose to start with the tapas sampler, a mixture of calamari, sausage, caper she, and an avocado with crab. The sausage was good, however had sat around so was a little cold for my liking. As for the calamari, cooked in a sweet chili sauce...a little disappointing, not a traditional Italian style with marinara. As for the avocado, a slice of avocado with crab meat on top??? Very strange.

We chose the lobster ravioli and the Mahimahi with puttanesca special. The ravioli was good, however, not warm. As for the fish, unfortunately I had to send it back. I noticed a strange smell when it arrived and upon tasting it I knew it was not right. I tried to flag my waiter, however, he was MIA. Finally I was able to grab another waiter and expressed my concern and chose another option, veal scaloppini, which came out piping hot and was good, not great.

Everything was ok until the server brought our bill!!! I went over to the front desk and the man who spoke to me was not only rude but also impatient!! I was trying to tell him what the person who took my reservation said but he cut me short and said ""oh no you have to pay for the cake!!"" 

That would not have been an issue if they told me that when I called and actually remembered to sing for us!!! I was mad but still wanted to surprise my husband so I paid for the cake! 

When I wrote a review the manager called and told us to go for coffee and desert so he could fix it for us, the greeter treated us like we were lying when I told him who sent us and even wanted to see the email!!

The atmosphere is great in a quaint sort of way- the live music on weekends, the manager who kisses your hand, the fancy covers on your plates when entrees are served, the slightly dated decor. Maybe that's not your thing, but I found it refreshingly authentic in a city dominated by trendy-chains. The only downside for me was the prices, as they are steep.

Heck - you may drive by without even realizing it's there, or - worse - stopping at the larger cafeteria on the corner of the mall or the family-style restaurant across the street.  Either would be a huge mistake.  Instead, head to the corner and find a nice surprise.



While the decor won't win any awards, and the buffet isn't large, what you will find is a well-stocked selection of tasty entrees on the steam table, surprising desserts (including hand-dipped butter pecan ice cream and pecan pie) and staff that is generally eager to please.  The only downfall is the aforementioned location which can be tough to find, the smallness of the place and that they don't generally pay much attention once you are there - so if you drink a lot (as I do), you may find your glass empty more than once.

I used to live within walking distance from this place back between 99 and 00 and it was an AWESOME restaurant owned by, GASP!, Asians. The food was good and the place had a decent crown any time of the day.



Fast forward to late 2010 and it's now owned by Hispanics. The place was nearly empty and the food was practically inedible. Everyone from the waiters, cooks and even the cashier/manger/owner were Hispanic.



After circling the buffet area several times wondering why certain ingredients in the food were still moving, I finally sat down with a very questionable, steaming pile of what looked like food.



The fried rice was a soy-sauce-soaked gelatinous mass, the eggrolls were burned, yet somehow, soggy and only had cabbage and the seafood dish had 44% broccoli, 5%carrots, 1% seafood and 50% some sticky, thick, brown syrupy blasphemy I did not dare touch.

Popping in at 6PM, which should have been the peak of the dinner rush, there was only one other table with people eating. I should have taken that as a clue. But the buffet table looked okay (from a distance) and I opted to stick around.



Taking a plate, I selected a few sliced chicken and sliced beef items that were not too dry and overcooked.  Too many vegetables that had been picked over, but if I looked underneath, there was some okay stuff. The plate was half-full. For the second plate, I tried some others. Unsatisfying. About the only thing that helped was that there was hot mustard on the cold table.



Dessert saved them from one star. In the ice cream case was a sliced pecan pie. Very strange to have something like this at a Chinese buffet, but with some soft serve ice cream, it was the best thing I had.

The shining light is the owner, Tony Nguyen, who (I kid you not) came to my table and serenaded me and my mom completely out of the blue, and actually sat down to talk. Tony is HILARIOUS.

It really wasn't a big deal since it's a self-serve buffet after all, but we flagged down the manager because we had a question. 



Although the brunch is quite extensive, it is rather pricey at $16. Since my mother is a little older now, she doesn't eat a lot so we politely asked if she could just have a muffin or something small from the buffet and pay a reduced price instead of being charged for a full brunch. This manager (I didn't get her name) picked up the gift certificate and seemed perturbed by the very question! We heard an inaudible remark as she read it over, making it blatantly obvious she DID NOT want to accommodate this simple request. She reluctantly gave in and then walked away as if she was pissed that she agreed to it. 



Whatever her name, this so-called manager definitely does NOT belong in hospitality, much less in charge of a popular water-front restaurant! She only smiles when you are greeted, but otherwise has a general rough, hardened look to her. As I ate my meal, she made it a point to check our table to make sure my mother wasn't getting more that just a muffin as agreed-- (oh no!!) On top of that, they TAXED my FREE gift certificate!

I'm not one to throw out one star reviews lightly, but my recent dining experience at Nau-Ti-Gal really left me with no choice.  It was the perfect storm of lackadaisical service, cheesy decor and a complete and utter lack of want by the kitchen.



As I was dieting at the time, I decide to go with the seafood salad, since the restaurant has a nautical theme and the menu exclaimed the dish as the ""Best seafood salad around!"".  A simple dish for a restaurant that proclaims the use of ""fresh and local ingredients"" on their website.  What I received was a sad plate of wilted iceberg lettuce with a couple cherry tomatoes and some chunks of hard-boiled eggs tossed in.  The seafood component of the meal was just as craptastic, an overdressed mix of tiny, canned shrimp and canned crab meat that the family cat won't touch.  Just an utter fail from a kitchen that apparently takes no pride in what it serves.  The only positive I can come up with is that I didn't wreck my diet that night as I barely touched my meal.



My wife suffered a similar fate with her chicken salad.  It had the same sorry looking greens topped with bland, overcooked strips of chicken breast meat.  Again a simple dish that can be great with fresh, well prepared ingredients, but the kitchen failed to deliver.



Service was sporadic for our group of 20 on a slow Thursday night at the restaurant.  Wait times were long for both our drinks and food.   Our server wasn't real helpful when looking for entree recommendations and I was disappointed that our server never checked in to see how our meals were.  Our group as able to get separate checks, so there's a small positive.

The location is pretty nice, but watch out for outside seating + summer days. That's going to lead to a loooooooot of mosquito bites. 



Anyways, came here with a bunch of people for restaurant week, and got their 3-course meal deal.



I got their clam chowder, surf & turf and brownie sundae.



The clam chowder was very rich and creamy, with a ton of flavor. Definitely my favorite dish.



The surf & turf was pretty good, though the waitress messed up our orders, and I ended up with medium well instead of medium rare. The steak was tough, but it was very tasty. The lobster was well seasoned and juicy, but the butter was a bit too oily for me. I also really enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes that came on the side.



I didn't try too much of the sundae, since I was extremely full by the time it came to dessert, but from the few bites I've had; it was extremely rich and sweet.  It was probably a bit too heavy for a dessert option, but oh well.



The food was good and the location was ok, so why the 3 stars? Well, our service wasn't the greatest. I realize our waitress was new, but that's no excuse for messed orders and delayed service. One of my friends didn't get her drink until 20 minutes later.

As part of the Restaurant Week deal, I ordered the clam chowder, the surf and turf, and the rocky road brownie sundae. 



The clam chowder was super rich and chock full of clams, but it was a little tooooo thick for my liking. Definitely felt a little like drinking gravy - as someone mentioned below. Still, I thought it was super cute that they served the chowder in a mug. Classic!



As for the steak, I ordered it medium well, which got a few weird stares from my dining companions, but I like my meat cooked! The steak did end up being a little too tough and hard to chew, but at least it wasn't bleeding all over the place. Definitely nothing spectacular about the steak here though - I'd suggest ordering some sort of seafood instead. The lobster tail was phenomenal, and totally made up for the mediocrity of the steak. It was well-seasoned and tasted fresh, which, given the restaurant's location in the Midwest, was a nice surprise.



The sundae was served super melted, which made it a lot less appetizing...It was also a little too heavy and too sweet to end the meal with. I ate a portion of the brownie, salvaged what I could of the ice cream, and sat back and waited for the check.



Service was suuperrr slow and I don't think it was because it was only our waitress' first day on the job. The other servers didn't seem particularly accommodating either, and spent a lot of their time joking and messing around with each other. Our waitress gave us each $10 coupons at the end of our meal that we could use another time. I don't know if it was some sort of promotion that they were offering everyone or if it was her way of apologizing for the lackadaisical service. Who knows.



For the $25 price tag, the starter/entree/dessert Restaurant Week combo was a great way to sample the menu. Now that I have though, I don't think I'll be back.",negative
ts47,4/20/2014,revtest4749,3,"Had Easter Brunch here today.  We had a 1:45 Reservation and we arrived at 1:30.  When we arrived I walked around to check out the buffet.  This is not your normal buffet.  It is set up in the bar and booths around the bar.  We were seated in a small room and our server stopped and explained the Buffet and got our drink order.  I ordered a Bloody Mary (more on that later).  We went and got our plates off the booth seat (Really?)  and ordered omelets from the Omelet bar.  There were wonderful.  My wife liked these French fry things that they had.  The French Toast was good as well.  The Prime Rib was too rare for our tastes and the Peel and Eat shrimp was peppery.    Overall the food was good, but I am not sure we would go back for brunch.  Pretty expensive at $26/person.  Back to the Bloody Mary.  I think it had a tablespoon of Celery salt and too much Worcestershire Sauce.  I guess according to the server they make their own Bloody Mary mix.  They can keep it if you ask me.  I would have comped the drink as I informed the server that it was to my liking and I didn't drink that much of it, but that's just me.  I should have returned it.  IN her defense she did ask me if I wanted something else, but I am not sure if I would have had to pay for it or it would have been instead of?

ts47,6/2/2014,revtest4752,2,"I hate to have to leave this poor review, but I must. We have been frequent patrons of the Nauti-Gal when we are in Madison for long weekends, and have always been treated just fine. Well, we returned this past weekend, just for drinks on Friday night and dinner on Saturday. They were ""busy"" from the sounds of the employees. Yes there was a crowd there, but I have worked for a facility where fewer employees have handled a crowd much larger. Also, they should train their employees not to blame slow service on other staff. I heard, from three different members of the wait staff, ""I am sorry for the wait, the kitchen is so slow."" Or, from our particular waiter, ""geez, 45 minutes later. Sorry."" Our meal was actually delicious, drinks were great, and I highly recommend the pub chips...the tangy sauce is to die for.  

When it came time to pay, our waiter (a fairly newer employee, tall, thin and darker skin, working the outside bar) dropped our check off and said he would be right back. A good 15-20 passed and nothing. My husband became irritated and went up to the bar with the check to pay, since we obviously weren't getting anywhere by waiting.  The other bartender (shorter gentleman, with a buzzed or bald head) stated ""oh you wanna pay? You have to wait for your waiter.""  He completely turned us away. So as my husband walks back over to me, he says ""I'll just take it inside."" As he attempted to go up the stairs, that bald gentleman said ""here I'll take it.""  As he was waiting, our actual waiter came back behind the bar and the other bartender said ""hey, did you have this gentleman?"" He responded ""no.""

The bald one says ""oh well thy had this....and this...."" His reply, ""nope not me."" Without even looking at us! So very rude!! 

Completely different service than what we had Friday night, at the inside bar! They were polite, not over friendly or social, but very efficient!! We didn't have to wait on drinks, they were ready when we were! 

Sad to say, not sure we will be returning when we come back in a few weeks. It's a shame, but it seems like the service is slipping. My recommendation to you, maybe not have so many ""newer"" employees on the same shift, on a busy Saturday evening. It was so obvious that they were way too overwhelmed.",negative
ts47,6/16/2014,revtest4753,1,"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! This was without question the worst meal that I have had at a restaurant. I can see going there for a drink as it has a pretty outdoor area, however the food is GARBAGE. We ordered the ""customers favorite"" Baby Walleye fish and iit was almost entirely breading with a little bit of tough and clearly frozen fish.  The service was also terrible.  We ordered salads, appatizers and entres and all were brought out at the same time. The waiter had to be reminded that a salad came with the dinner. When the meal ended, I had hardly eaten any of the food on my plate and not only did the waiter never ask if everything was okay, he didn't offer a doggy bag or ask if something was wrong with the food.  Dinner for 2 was over $50 despite the fact that I could buy better fish in the frozen children's food section of a grocery store.  DO NOT EAT HERE...IT WAS AWFUL!",negative
ts47,7/19/2014,revtest4754,2,"That was a really frustrating experience. We've been here a couple times by boat because the location is great. I'm pretty sure our server was incompetent. There was a wait for service, a wait for food but apparently plates are in short supply because the server was clearing the table while we were still eating.  That makes me nuts because it's rude. 



One of the meals was prepared incorrectly and had to be remade and it took forever.  Sure they were a little busy when we got there but it was a ghost town by the time we escaped.  



The incorrect meal was not comped as I would have done had it been my call. That was weird. I'd suggest eating somewhere else but I wish it was better.",negative
ts47,8/10/2014,revtest4755,2,"This is near our house, so we like to pop in. The outdoor seating is great in summer, and the tropical menu is fun on a cold, winter day.



Food is okay. Nothing I particularly crave between visits, but it is nicer than most waterfront joints where you can park a boat. 



I do enjoy the house salad. Strangely, it comes with a little side cup of chocolate chip cookie dough. I don't know why they include this, especially since cookie dough contains raw egg (I'm surprised there isn't some code they are violating), but I happen to love chocolate chip cookie dough and I can't wait to eat it with my salad.



I tried something different tonight: curry chickpea and lentil stew. It was pretty good! I can't stand cilantro and was able to order the entree without it.



My husband had a massive cheeseburger, which he loved. I can attest the fries were great as well. They leave some skin on and use a lot of salt. Yum.



Now for the reasons this is a two star review instead of higher:



The outdoor seating process is a complete cluster. If you enter the front door at the hostess stand and ask for an outside table, they tell you to go outside to be seated. OK, no problem. We'll go outside.



Outside, we were told all tables were full and to go INSIDE to get a pager from the hostess. We saw open tables near the outdoor bar and asked if we could eat at those tables. The waitress said those were first come, first serve, and we could eat dinner there. She was very friendly about it, ""Yes, they'll give you menus there and take care of you, but you just have to order from the bartender because there is no table service.""



We were good with that and grabbed a table. I went to the bar for menus and I was told we could only order appetizers in the bar section. I explained the waitress had just told us we could order off the full menu. Bartender's response: ""Oh, was that the one in the orange shirt?"" Me: ""No, it was someone in a blue shirt."" I'm not sure why that mattered but should not have been the response. 



Bartender says we have to go inside for a pager to get a table. By this time more customers are ahead of us in line. On a Saturday night, every place we'd visit with patio seating would be busy, so we decided to get a pager and wait.



I get a pager from the inside hostess stand. I will skip writing about the conversation between the hostess and the waitresses since this review is getting long. However, I will note the person who had just told me we could order off the full menu at the outdoor bar was there and I told her we had just learned we had to get a regular table to order from the full menu. Her reply, ""Oh, sorry, I forgot.""



We then go back to the outside bar to wait for the pager to buzz.



Surprisingly, it only took about 10 minutes for a table to become available. I go back to the outdoor hostess stand, walking by one of the three open tables we'll be seated at, and the waitress tells me I have to take my pager back inside before she will seat me. I just about lost my mind at this point!!! I keep my head cool and level, despite my frustration. I walk BACK into and through the restaurant to drop off the pager. The hostess says thanks and tells me to go back outside and find a waitress to seat us. 



Restaurant Manager: if you read this review, please fix this process! All the burden of finding a table is on your customers. Hire a real hostess for outside and either give her a stack of pagers or have her commit to memory who is on the wait list. I cannot believe how disorganized this was.

I have gone to this restaurant many times in my life. In the 60's it was a tavern and bait shop that had boat rental. I had not been to the Nau-Ti-Gal for years, and when my daughter and her BF came up from FL for Christmas we decided to take them there as it is a unique location and I in the past the food was pretty good. Saturday 12/27/14  we got there at 6:30 and the place was dead, which I thought a little odd. My wife ordered the seafood salad, my daughter, her BF and I ordered the Prime Rib special of the night, each meal came with a cup of clam chowder. My wifes seafood salad consided of canned baby shrimp, and canned crab meat on lettuce and tomatoes. The Prime Rib was a dark red color which I later realized was a Sam's pre-cooked Prime, I've had before. Later that night I got a gut ache, which turned into several trips to the bathroom, my wife got it the next morning, I'm thinking it was the chowder.

ts48,12/28/2009,revtest4759,4,"I am not a huge pizza fan, really. So when I walked into Rocky Rococo's for my nephews birthday I was not thrilled.



There is a nice big regular dining area as well as a smaller area in the back meant for parties. In an adjoining valley sits a smattering of video games. There is plenty of variety like the claw vending machine, skee ball, and good old fashion Pac-Man. Keeping the kids entertained here is no chore (with a few spare dollars, that is).



When the pizza arrived I limply grabbed for a tasting. Holy crud, this is GREAT. I actually want another piece! For those of you in the know...it reminds me of Omaha's Godfather's Pizza. Of medium thickness and simply flowing with gooey cheese, I asked for more cheese and peperoni too.

As a Madison-born institution, it always tastes better within city-limits.  After years of living in the Milwaukee area where most of the Rocky's are in mall food courts, this place seems amazing.  A movie theater and game room?  Great place to bring the kids.



Rocky's may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this is THE Madison pizza. I don't care what any critics think.  I very well may be Rocky Rococo's biggest fan.  I fly back to Wisconsin just to eat it.

ts48,6/19/2012,revtest4762,3,"Was in a pinch for lunch today and didn't feel like eating healthy, so I swung over to Rocky's for a slice and some breadsticks.



Arrived promptly at noon, and struggled to find parking.  The lot isn't conducive to a lunch rush (or a large party).  Soda machines are placed too closely to the order/pickup/pay area, so it was crowded and confusing in that area.



Despite the line of people and the congestion, I managed to order a slice of ""Perfect"" (sausage, onion, peppers, mushrooms) with an order of stix.  I paid and had the chow in hand in less than 3 minutes.  Not bad at all.



I filled my drinking cup with some Gold Peak unsweet iced tea and found a table in the center dining area.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the area clean and welcoming.  



The slice of pizza was indeed perfect.  It had been freshly made - if it sat waiting for more than a minute, I'd be surprised.  The stix were also piping hot - another good sign.



Folks, this isn't gourmet, hand-crafted, one-off pizza.  It's cheap, fast, and if you arrive at the right time of day, good.  I had zero complaints with the pizza or stix.  The mushrooms were fresh (not canned), and the peppers and onions appeared to be of solid quality.  There wasn't any excessive grease, and the Italian sausage chunks were flavorful.



For $8, I was pleased with my lunch.  I'm not so sure I'd want to hang out here when the place is full of screaming kids, but during the work week, I'd definitely return.



They also have a small selection of tap beers - reasonably priced at $3.50/pint.

While there was the giant Rocky picture on the wall, with him in his white suit; it also has a large arcade and a cabana. I almost felt like I was in between a Chuckie Cheese and a Dave & Busters. All I saw were adults, but the target was for kids.



If you haven't had their pizza, then you must have either been MIA for the past few years or despise pizza all together. I find the regular slice with bread sticks and a soda to be just enough for a quick lunch. In and out, that's how it needs to be.



What I really don't like is not having the option to be able to bus my own table. It makes the place look especially dirty and discourages me from going there during the peak hours for lunch or dinner. Plus, if they haven't gone around to tables in a while, you're stuck sitting in someone else's mess. No thanks.

The pizza was just...not good. The sauce was bland, the cheese as fake as a three dollar bill, and the bottom crust steamed and damp with water. The edges of the crust were filled with what purported to be smoked mozzarella. Biting into it was what I imagine biting into an inflated inner tube would be like -- rubbery resistance at first, followed by flavorless chew. It's nothing that should be fed to people or any other animal. I actually regret finishing my meal; I felt ill for a few hours afterwards.

Their salad bar could be so good if the manager would put attention to what their employees are doing, I have seen many times when they refill the veggies just by putting them on top, they don't even bother in flipping out the container and put at least the new veggies at the bottom and the old ones on top. Somebody can get sick easily by this poor food management. I used to go to this location twice a week and now maybe once every three months and just because deep in my heart I have the hope somebody noticed what is happening there, but I really doubt it.

Granted this was my first time here but come on it was great! 



The place is in a strip mall south of Peoria on the west side, with other types of Mexican shops all around it. It fits right in. 



I had a green chile burrito, rice and beans. It was $4.95, it came with chips and salsa too. 



The burrito was plenty big and filled with a great flavored and cooked Green chilie, topped with green sauce and cheese. The cheese was a white type not the cheddar type. YUMMY 



The beans were one of my favorite parts, they were soooo good. Again topped with the white cheese. 



The rice was very good and had a great flavor. 



The chips and salsa we re wonderful, anytime you get free chips is good. They also serve a guacamole type dip with the chips. I do not like regular guac but this was rather tasty.

We tried asking the server how they got their beans to taste so extraordinarily smoky-good, and all she could (or would) tell us was that they used a certain kind of Mexican seasoned oil.

I was assuming when I requested chicken that both items would have chicken on them - something to keep in mind.  The taco was excellent!  A crunchy shell housed deliciously tender chicken, and fresh lettuce and tomato on top.  The tostada was OK, but I think that has way more to do with the fact that I'm not a huge refried beans fan.

I highly recommend the new avocado corn tacos! Ultra tasty.  Also glad they went back to battering their own Original tacos! Sad to see the Mahi Mahi go away, but it got replaced by Ono, so next visit I'll try those, grilled AND blackened - cuz that's how I used to enjoy the Mahi. 



Things I can complain about on this visit are: 

People need to learn to ROLL limes before slicing them...otherwise, getting the juice outta them is pretty unlikely without using the death grip that always ends with the juice right in yer eye!

Prices have gone up a bit...I understand fuel costs and all that but three bucks a taco is getting pricey. However, I'd rather the prices stay as high as they are rather than have freshness and quality suffer.",positive

Unrelated to rubios, we were sitting outside and the mall security guard just came up to our table, maybe a foot or less from me, and started staring through the window looking at the menu. It was a little unnerving, just him standing there with his stuff in my face while I'm eating. Little weird.

I advanced to the point were I had to pay and I ordered a large drink.  I got the blackberry tea which was great, but... no splenda or sweet and lo.  Nothing at all.  I had to go back to the register and was only able to get sugar... which I did not want.  So I went without.  It was still thirst quenching.. but not ideal.  The whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area.  Even though I asked for dining in, they still packed me to go... was this a hint? or was it that they ran out of plates.  I think the latter.

That was still wrong because she then dumped the chow mein back into the pan and gave him all fried rice. Weird.

So then I ordered. Asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken. She scoops the fried rice onto the plate and then takes my boyfriend's order. Then she asks me what entree. Honey sesame chicken! Ugh. My boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything. Then I get up to the register. I ask for 2 small drinks. The cashier asks me what size. Small! She rings me up and hands me one cup. I asked for two! So we then had to pay for the second drink... We go to fill up our drinks and there is spillage all over the drink station.

Sat down to eat. The honey sesame chicken was cold. The orange chicken was barely warm. The teriyaki chicken? It was great! Delicious meat, yummy sauce. That was the winner. The fried rice was also good. At times it has been undercooked/crunchy, but they did a good job today. The Panda Passion tea is very good too.

Sushi Kee is a small neighborhood sushi bar with quality fish, portions to wow and prices that make you think twice about stopping by the market on your way home from work.   Use Omega 3  fatty acids as your justification.  The first time you go you will over order if you do your usual checklist.  The slabs of fish are about 6 inches long, more than an inch wide teetering on a bit of rice,  deliciously fresh.   I folded mine like a pizza sandwich and attempted the all in one bite, not a chance.   My favorite this night was the salmon - great fat content with that butter consistency.   If salmon isn't fresh, no amount of wasabe and soy can mask it,  this was perfection.



I can't wait to go back.",positive
ts53,6/23/2008,revtest4809,1,"This restaurant came highly recommended so I was eager to check it out. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. 



First, the portion sizes are incredibly large, which you'd think would be great. However, they're SO large that it begs the question of how on earth they're able to afford to give out these portions for a relatively cheap price? We're talking fresh, raw fish, not American-style buffet. Bigger is not always better, especially when it comes to sushi. 



The albacore was pretty tasty, I'll give it that. However, the rice was hot in the sushi and rolls!



Hot rice is disgusting!!!!!! So, so, SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO gross and a huge turn off!!! It warms the fish to the point of it not tasting right. Also if you don't eat the rolls immediately, the entire thing changes its consistency because the hot rice is melding with the cold fish and other vegetables. There is nothing more disappointing and disgusting than unknowingly biting into a warmed piece of sushi with hot rice. 



They also only had 2 sushi chefs in the very packed restaurant. The rolls came out sloppier than I'd make at home. The rice to fish ratio was totally off. There was so much fish in the rolls and so little rice you couldn't even fit the whole thing in your mouth. The rolls were literally falling apart from the moment the chef cut into them, mainly from the lack of tightness when being rolled. It looked like a total mess.



Sushi is just as much about the beautiful presentation and the flavor of the rice, as it is about the taste of the fish. Unfortunately this place had mediocre fish and horrible presentation...and hot rice, which tells me they're not willing to take the time (or care about their customers enough) to present fish properly.",negative

Well, I guess by serving less-than-fresh fish.  I ordered Albacore sashimi and took one bite, spit it out, and sent it back.... the fish was BAD.  The chef actually took a piece, ate it, and tried to tell me nothing was wrong with it and that perhaps it was the pungent sauce!  Wtf?",negative

I loved this place! You are definitely not paying for the ambiance, but I think that actually makes it a better place to go, because the focus is the food, not the location. We arrived shortly after happy hour ended, but with a few pleas and smiles, we were given happy hour rates (with a reminder that next time we would need to pay full price if we were late again). I absolutely love that kind of customer service - especially when I'm the benefactor.



We ordered the Viva Las Vegas, Rainbow, a Hawaiian special, and an other eel roll that I didn't try. We ordered 6 rolls for 4 people and we were all well fed by the end of our dinner.

As far as AZ sushi however, I think Sushi Kee takes the cake. All 4 of us left here completely satisfied. Prices were right. Portions were generous. Atmosphere was comfortable. Fish was fresh.

I ordered the lunch sushi combo (which is 8 pcs sushi, 2 pc shrimp tempura, 2 pc vegetable tempura for $9) and some eel and avocado rolls. When it came out, I was shocked by the amount of fish. For me, I hate when you order sushi and its a giant lump of rice with a tiny sliver of fish on top. These sushi were a small lump of rice with a slab of fish. It's like two pieces of generously sliced sashimi, no kidding. In fact, I just moved half the fish to the rice and ate the other half as sashimi. The fish was fresh and good.



The roll was really good too. It was a little bigger/wider than I normally like. But the flavors were good, and again, lots of eel.



All of that food, plus a bowl of miso, a salad and a mug of green tea cost $18. That's a great value. So yeah, Sushi Kee may not ever win any culinary awards. They presentation isn't as good as what you might find in much more expensive Japanese restaurants. But they are good and a great value.

ts53,2/26/2013,revtest4836,4,"My friend and I visited Sushi Kee for the first time last night, having driven by it a thousand times without a second thought given the neighborhood and the simple exterior.  We had seen the good reviews and, wanting something different, decided to give it a try.  At first we were prepared to be disappointed.  When we arrived there was only one waitress working and she was so distracted by a technical issue with the credit card machine that it took us nearly twenty minutes to even get our menus.  The complimentary salad had an interesting dressing but my portion, at least, was nearly 1/3 dressing and utterly overwhelmed the lettuce.  I can also honestly say that I have never had such bland miso soup in my life.  Not an auspicious start to the meal.



Despite the rough beginning, we were very happy to learn that every Sunday, Monday and Tuesday is all-day Happy Hour, for which the entire menu is discounted.  We tried three rolls and two orders of nigiri and our bill was only a little over $40.  The rest of the week, Happy Hour ends at 6:30.  



Our first roll, the name of which escapes me, we only ordered out of curiosity because we had never seen a sushi roll with cheese and this one had tempura shrimp, avocado, cream cheese and mozzarella.  While it was an interesting experience we would definitely not order it again.  It was so heavy and greasy that we really didn't feel like we were even eating sushi.



Everything after that roll, though, was excellent!  The Salmon Skin Roll was perfect and the 9-1-1 Roll was very fresh and tasty.  Unfortunately, there was only one sushi chef and he was clearly in a hurry, as the rolls were not as neat and well-formed as one would hope.  It was clear that presentation was not a priority at Sushi Kee, which detracted some from the meal.



Where the restaurant really shined, though, was the nigiri.  It's been mentioned before, but the nigiri pieces are very big, well priced and fresh.  We initially only ordered tuna and unagi but had to request another order of the unagi because it was just so delicious.  My friend commented that the rice had the best flavor that she could recall at any sushi restaurant that we've visited.  



While Sushi Kee won't score a perfect five stars from us do to the lack of polishing on the edges, we will definitely be back.  We are already planning another visit during one of the Happy Hour days, but this time we will simply stick to the nigiri.",positive

All were delicious!  Lately we have been trying to avoid rice and have been ordering sashimi and other specialties like the Tiger Eye specialty.  Yum.  The sashimi is very reasonable, especially when you order the 27 piece platter.  We did not like the octopus or surf clam (Nothing to do with the restaurant as we have tried both before and not liked it).  So, today when we ordered we asked for a substitute and they agreed, no problem.  Great place!  My husband does not like seafood, so we get him a mongolian beef and everyone is happy.  :-)",positive

I had the ""Mesa"" roll.  The Jalepeno was simply an uncooked piece sliced from a raw, whole Jalepeno.  To hot, too crisp, to wrong.  My friend had the ""Murphy Roll"" which had cream cheese, some yellow thing we could not identify (egg) avacado and crab meat.  The fish was practically non-existant and the roll (although pretty) was generally tasteless.  The shrimp tempura was undercooked.  With no alcohol and only one soft drink our lunch was 29$ which to me is far too expensive for a small restaurant in a bad part of town.  For the same money I could have lunch at RA.

We also had Las Vegas roll that was pretty good. I'm always a big fan of Las Vegas roll it don't matter what sushi place. We also got the Calamari which I think it was kinda over cooked? Texture was kinda rubbery my wife said. The portion was pretty small too compared to Ra sushi that's my opinion.

I've had large rolls at other places before, but none that fell apart like this.  I'm not sure if it was a sushi construction issue, or a rice quality/cooking issue, but it's a real detractor.

I'd say this place serves some decent grub but they can't make up their mind what kind of restaurant to be. The middle panel of the menu boasts middle eastern lavosh while the right panel advertises Italian and the left panel offers typical sandwiches with a quesadilla thrown in for a twist. It's definitely not a destination restaurant more the kind of place you need when it's scorching outside and you're dying of hunger and thirst...okay, it's not that bad, but why go unless you just happen to stumble into it on your way to someplace else and if that's the case, you wouldn't be reading this review.",negative

It was my first time singing karaoke... which means I needed a lot of drinks in me.  They kept the martinis coming, but I can't tell you if they were good or not, because I was pretty drunk.  We ordered food too, but I was too excited to sing to eat any of it.  But it mostly disappeared, so it must of been okay. 



I put 4 songs on my piece of paper, but was only called on once in the 4 hours we were there.  They said there was a rotation, but others got to sing more than a few times and everyone in my group only got to sing once.  I felt like they were giving the 'regulars' more songs.  



Also, it was a Saturday night and the 'regulars' were all singing country songs and showtunes.  I was practicing all week, I wanted to SING!!!! And their slow songs were boring me.



So hopefully there are other options in the valley for Karaoke, it did feel pretty awesome singing and dancing on the stage, in a drunken stupor and I'd like to do it again sometime.

as soon as we sat down, a woman started singing. she was pretty decent and the song was a crowd pleaser. then it happened.



some dude, about 5'2"" gets up on stage, and starts dancing at her, while she's singing. i say at, because she was not dancing. no one was. except this guy, who was also in his mid-40s and sporting a sweet comb-over. it was seriously like someone planted him as a prank, like we were being taped for a surprise tv show. 



we all sat there looking at each other, then looking at him, then back at each other. the lady was a trooper, she just kept singing. finally, the song was over, and he opened his arms up, like he was going to hug her. finally, some other guy from the audience, pulled him away, back down to his seat. very awkwardly.

Inevitably we sing ""Don't Stop Believin'"", ""Piano Man"", and ""Sweet Caroline"". It will be a group of us guys and it is a good time had by all.

Seriously amazing voices and talent, but taking it a little TOO seriously. You know the types. I actually felt a little uncomfortable and out of place until I FINALLY got to since my first song. Our waitress was a total bitch and tried to short change my friend $10. We hadn't had THAT many drinks that we wouldn't have noticed $10 missing on a $3.00 beer. 



Fast forward to about 10:30 or 11. Many drinks have been had at this point and the regulars have thinned out. Crowd is pumped, singing along, dancing on stage and having a great time! The place is packed with people who just want to sing along, dance, and get a little crazy - not try to score a record deal! My type of crowd for sure. 



Moral of the story: If you are a super serious Karaoke starlet that feels you missed out on your record deal, go early, like 5pm and then please leave promply at 10. If you want to go and shake your ass, sing along to every song out there, and have a grand old time, hit it up after 10. Just don't expect to get a seat.",negative
ts54,9/6/2009,revtest4891,4,"A karaoke bar on a Saturday night?! Get outta here! This place rocked. A little too packed though. The best way to describe the floor plan for this place is it's like an hour glass. It gets congested in the middle (where the bar starts and the drink prices are kinda pricey) so if you're trying to get from the front to the back, where all the action is, be a little patient; good things come to those who wait. There's also a nice patio for those people looking to get some fresh air or take a break from all the action. The karaoke host doesn't quite stick to the order in which your song request is submitted (some people sang twice before I got my ONE chance). All in all, it was a fun spot and most of the people there were cool; not what I had expected based on previous experiences I've had in that area. THUMBS UP FOR THAT! Oh yah, I also got to meet some fellow Yelpers there too who, which was the cherry on top! I'll definitely be found there again messing up more songs for public entertainment. nAcHo: Coming soon to a karaoke bar near you!!! 



***Da Bafroom: 4 stars for the bafroom! WOO HOO!!! A delightful aroma streamed throughout this miniature suite adding to the already pleasant experience I was having. The interior design/decoration was up-to-date with tiled walls, 2 fancy new urinals and one bathroom stall for those looking to participate in ""floor mounted porcelain activities"". Bathroom soap was definitely Dial (TM) or an imitation Dial Liquid Soap which, for this place and it's location, I would have expected something more fancy and better smelling like Body Works soap or Bed Bath and Beyond stuff.

The drinks are cheap, so you can afford to have enough to make other people sound good.



I've heard the best rendition of RESPECT I will ever hear in my lifetime at The Grapevine.  It was sung by a straight man using a feminine voice and it was so bad it was good.  



My friends sang a Spanish duet that I begged them not to sing and two people actually sang along!?  I thought that shiz was gonna bomb, but I was wrong.  



You will probably be the last to sing if you are not a regular.  That would be me and so I always get screwed.  I end up singing ""I Touch Myself"" to my friends and the only other person in the room who's name hasn't been called.  



If you do get the chance to sing at a peak time, drunk strangers will probably dance behind you on stage, some may even try to come up and sing along with you.  Someone will most certainly play the bongo drums in the corner, and that someone will most definitely not pay attention to the beat.

As I am walking into the Grapevine, I am invited by a gorgeous and cozy patio. Only the smokers are mingling there, due to the cold. Nice...I shall join them soon.



I enter and am all of a sudden in a small room, with two massive table things. Nothing but darkness and the sound of Elvis in the background. I was instantly confused. WTF is going on here?!?!



As I creep around the bar, I discover the backroom - packed with people of all sorts, an energetic DJ lady and various tunes blasting out of the karaoke machine that my grandmother most likely swayed her hips too. Shall I be scared or embrace it? I embrace it and feel oddly at home.



Since I don't have much of a singing voice, I opt for the other option: Liquor. I order the bloody mary, others order the margarita. Both were..meh. And pricy to be honest. The menu was huuuuge...talk about selection! The only thing missing from the menu, since it was all over the place, was Sushi. We order the chuck burger. Solid; as it should be for $7.50.



The BIGGEST negative, that left me with a horrible aura, was the bartender. No personality, rude, and just nothing I want to encounter again. This drug the star count down.

We ordered a few bottles of wine, and got a lavosh, sauteed chicken strips, and chili. The chili had a weird after taste to it, but the lavosh and the chicken strips were great! The lavosh was made with Dolfino cheese and Cajun chicken, which proved to be a great combination. I loved that the chicken was not dried out either :)

If you don't want songs with bad words to be sung, then take them out of your songbook.

She had an outstanding personality and actually got me through this bittersweet day, as all my friends are back in RI and I was sort of having a lonely 30th. I had the roast beef sandwich with the au jous sauce, salad and fries. I also had a glass of riesling (my personal favorite). And as Rose and I were talking about the difficulties of relocation I mentioned it was my birthday- no not to get anything for free. But I was treated to another glass of wine on the house and a slice of cheesecake.

Outdoor seating was nice, though the birds did get tiresome.  Place seemed clean.  Plenty of seats.  Upstairs deck area would be great in the evening.  Seems like it would be a much more fun place with a group of people for happy hour  or dinner than it was for lunch.

I actually LOVE karaoke, and the first time I went here I was excited to get up in front of an energetic audience and blast my way through some 80's pop song or another.  But apparently there are politics involved at The Grapevine when you want to sing.  The karaoke mistress runs the show with an iron fist, and only allows those that pay a small mortgage the opportunity to show their stuff.

Be warned that the while the Grapevine itself is spacious with a decently sized second floor deck, the karaoke is inside and it can get very cramped. There are only a handful of tables inside and on a night and especially a weekend night, it will be very crowded and will most likely take a little bit of time to get a drink and sing.

Every time she did anything she was gone for an inordinate amount of time before returning.  This became especially annoying when she gave each of our party of three drink refills one at a time. When the food finally arrived, it was no longer warm, so whatever she had been doing she allowed our food to sit for awhile before she brought it.  Bottom line: the staff had no idea what they were doing and were extremely slow in doing anything.  I now see that this slow service runs through all the Yelp reviews.  Now the food: not horrible, but below average.  Definitely not worth the wait.  The menu spans lavosh, mexican, burgers and gyros.  Too broad a choice for most chefs, and this one was no different.

That's what this place was all about. Karaoke. Not ambiance, not food, not drinks (see parenthetical note above) but pure, sing-your-heart-out screeching goodness.



When we arrived it was old school obscure songs by the regulars. People who had made bad decisions in their lives but were still clinging to the microphone of hope. Quite unamused by our crowd, they soon cleared out and we darn near had our own private karaoke room, save for the fellow in the Simpsons t-shirt and the ladies who were hooked on singing and may have walked the streets to find The Grapevine.

You'll be able up select from two books, one by artist & one by song title. The song selection was decent but certainly not the best I've ever seen. The crowd is on average in their 40s-50s but if you're younger it's waaay more fun if you go there with your friends.

It was surreal. 



Even more surreal than the scene itself - a collection of older folks singing country and standards, dive-bar drinks and atmosphere, and some bongos in the corner. And stiff, not all that cheap drinks.

Sure, it's not a well lit, clean or fancy bar in any way. And service is a bit slow, yet friendly. But the atmosphere, the clientele and the karaoke host  were absolutely bad ass. The crowd was a mix of people above 50 and people around 25-30. So every other song was unfamiliar to half of the bar and every other song was either terrible (in a good way) or totally awesome.

- At several points throughout the night our group was the only group of people in the place other than the KJ and bartenders. When this happened the KJ picked songs for us and made us sing them. Songs like I Like Big Butts or Short Dick Man

- The KJ joined several songs in accompaniment on the harmonica.

- It's a dive bar with karaoke!

- At one point the bartender was making me a drink and singing a karaoke song herself.



But, the truth is a 5 star rating might not be entirely fair. Because it is dirty and dim (as a dive bar should be). And personally I think they'd rather have their regulars in here than too many new, hipster-y folks indulging in the irony of singing a Salt-n-Pepa song while the older KJ plays along on his harmonica.

It's tiny inside though so you may not get a table and even if you do you are in pretty close quarters. I've never eaten there but it's always packed upstairs on their patio during the weekends so my guess is that it's good. They have a good downstairs patio too. I prefer to go here once it's already dark outside, I just feel like it's that kinda place. It's pretty old school. Another fun perk is that a lot of wedding parties will come here (it seems like from out of town) and get wasted and fight and cause a bunch of chaos. That has been the case on NUMEROUS occasions and has always been entertaining. Probably not to the best man who got kicked out of the wedding the night before at the Grapevine, but it was for the rest of us. Also something kind of funny is that we went for a friend of mine's birthday one time and I signed her up for ""in da club"" by 50 cent ...obviously because it was her birthday. The staff like cut her off mid song because it was inappropriate or something.

I enjoyed my meal but they were nothing special, just standard gyros. My girlfriend on the other hand did not  enjoy her meal. She had fettuccini with shrimp. The pasta was undercooked and the shrimp still had tails on them.

I was there on a Friday during spring training. Karaoke started at 5, which is earlier than most places, and not too busy. Later it got packed and there didn't appear to be a structured singer rotation, but if you seemed to be skipped, you could remind the KJ and he was cool. Only problem I had is that I was unaware that if paying with credit card/bank card they automatically hold $50 in addition to your bill, which will be credited back later, (in my case it was 5 days later) just sucks if you're not expecting it. 

I would definitely come back next time I'm in Scottsdale. Karaoke was  fun, food was good, waitress and bartenders were attentive even when it was packed, I would just bring cash.

The burger itself came with shredded lettuce and tomato already on it, so you couldn't really disassemble it, but I managed to scrape off the lettuce, which I didn't want.  Other than that, not a bad burger, thick and handmade, with a good toasted bun.

My fiancé is super sweet and thought she was having a bad day so he tried to cheer her up by complimenting her and  trying to make her laugh but she shot him dirty looks. There was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted. They could barely sing anymore and just kept bouncing around  and goofing off, which is normal for a bar. Except that she treated us like outsiders that didn't belong there. My friends went to cheer and spilled a tiny bit of beer because the glass was full. They were nice enough to apologize and clean it up and Mia told them they have to leave cause they were breaking things. There were 7 of us and not one person saw anything broken.. Just a few drops of beer that they so graciously cleaned up themselves. Mia said she didn't wanna clean up after us so we had to leave. At this point I decided she didn't deserve the nice tip my friend left on the counter. I told her to take it back, and the other bartender, an overweight brunette who's name I don't know, heard me and snatched it up quickly before I could. I had to tell Mia directly that she  gave us the worst service ever and I cannot allow my friend to tip her. She reluctantly gave it back. It takes this much for me to not tip someone. I'm a huge tipper. I work for tips too so I understand how this works, but I would never treat clients like she treated us. I earn my tips. This was literally the worst service I have ever had.

If you want to pop out a song or two and you don't know someone there, you may get passed up in the rotation, on occasion. The sound system was outdated and scratchy. 



The Good: You can sing starting at 5. Thats good if you want to hit it right after work. The server, Sarah (I believe), was cool. She brought us plenty of drinks. That's probably  because our party of 4 was hitting the Fireball and Crown like they were the last 2 bottles on earth. The pours were heavy, too, which is great for us, but probably hurts their bottom line. The pour may take me back of I'm in the area, so it could be good in the long run.  



All in all, I would give them a 3.5 if I could, but would label it a dive bar you can get drunk at and sing a song as an afterthought,  not the other way around. 



See my review on Ernie's, as well. It's about 15 minutes away from the Grapevine,  and worth the drive because of the awesome food,  excellent selection of songs and sound system, and real singers.",negative
ts54,10/9/2014,revtest4981,1,"You didn't hear it through the grapevine...you heard it straight from the horses mouth. DO NOT GO HERE FOR KARAOKE. Go for people watching if anything. I should've known when I called ahead. The sweet girl on the phone gave us directions. All of my friends were adamant about other places and I was rooting for the nice bartender and the possibility of a song.



When we arrived the place was packed! Yet she still knew I was the one who called (very Children of the Corn). I immediately (at 8:15) put 2 songs in. I said you can just pick one if it fits your line-up. Hoping they'd call me and then one of the 4 people I strung along would add a song in.



This did not happen. 



While we each had 3-4 drinks (and 14 songs played), yes, I counted them. Not one persons name was EVER called. It was like a 2-disc CD was playing and they already knew who was next. 



If you are new and you are going here to sing. Wait to be disappointed. It's so weird. Not like a cool dive bar weird, but like a scripted twilight zone that you will never be a part of weird. 



This bar doesn't need you. They have a following that will always be there. Lesbian softball chicks, older divorcees, old country dudes, and those women who debated on wearing their scrunchees, that dude with dreads that sings the lamest song from the 50s soda shop...amongst others. 



And you will still wait. But the CRAZIEST thing is that a name will never be called out. It's like a 3-disc set is playing. Before you know it someone else has the mic in their hand, because it's ""their turn"". 



I heard a woman singing Jeff Buckleys ""hallelujah"", which isn't a very popular song. But once I saw every demographic in the place singing it word for word, I knew. This wasn't a place to be reckoned with. You don't see a 60 year old man singing that song, unless they sing it so much you learn it! And that's what happens. It's a CD on rotation.



AND YOU DONT PLAY A PART. Go somewhere else.



14 songs, and you're not going to get called. 



My friend said to me jokingly, ""go sit on Santas lap and ask for your song."" Not that I would have. But it was humorous. 



Regardless of naught or nice, Santa will only play that song if he knows you've been coming there for years. Less work. Lazy DJ.

Tortilla soup was bland. They tried to get creative and made pizza with lavash (a bread that Middle Easterners typically use to wrap vegetables/meat and/or eat with spread) but it was a fail. The cheese was too heavy and the toppings were cold on top which made for an unpleasant sensation. Also it was difficult to eat; the lavash just kept breaking apart.

Music selection for karaoke was okay. They didn't have quite as much as I had hoped for. Nearly no Kanye West, and sometimes, white girls just need to rap.



I did however manage to get there around 1:15am and was able to sing a song before they closed at 2.



Another downside was the other patrons. People so drunk that they couldn't handle not getting in the middle of EVERYONE ELSE'S SONGS. It's fine to sing along if you know it, but don't stand there and try to sing into my microphone while I'm doing a duet of ""Mr. Roboto"" with my soulmate. GTFO of my facespace.



A random man, very gay, also tried to get with a male friend of ours who is very straight. My hot blonde best friend eventually sat on his lap and still this gay man did not get the hint. Don't get me wrong, I love the gays, but no matter who you are, you shouldn't be forcing yourself on someone who clearly doesn't want it. Male or female.

Ya know that xmas story when they say... ""Nothing was stirring, not even a mouse?"" Yea, that's what it felt like. Finally, after siiting around for 30 mins, the pro shop opens. We pay for our rounds, and get 10 mins to hit some balls. 



*10 mins later*



We get to the tee box, no starter. Even the groundskeepers were running behind. Not a big deal, the guys were cool. With my limited spanish I was talking to one gentleman, and he was talking about how one course is down, and its a lot of work for them at the moment. I get it. They're busy, it's my day off, no big deal. The pace of play was slow, because each tee box we got to were being groomed, the tee boxes were on the side of the tee box, so we had to slow down a bit. Whos fault was that? Ours, of course. Golf course was in great shape, the views are amazing (I like Sun Ridge Canyon more, personally.)

Well, in the REAL world, we wait till after our food arrives to usually pay... if you want a good tip anyways. Maybe I am in a different country it's otherwise... I answer I'll take care of it with cash. Here's his god to honest answer.



""We do not accept cash.""

Last time I checked, this is America, and it's safe to accept legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve, buddy.



Get the food, fries were the best part. 





Get the check and the 20% is automatically added. Wow. We had a party of 3... not 8 or 10, 3.... Three. no wonder there was bad service.



TL-DR?



The service all around needs to be stepped up if. It's too far to be treated that way. But then again, if memberships is all they want, maybe they've found their niche. Old people all around, a nd a lot of people who don't care. Nice business plan, guys!

ts55,5/28/2012,revtest4991,3,"Played the Peaks course and the greens were rock hard so nothing held, not even little chips. I didn't mind the layout so much but make sure you get a map of the course from the pro shop if this is your first time around because there is a lot of blind shots. This course is targety and has many split fairways that end in desert. The greens putted really nicely, very fast and smooth. I wasn't super impressed with the starter who questioned me about my HCP like I was being interrogated by the police. I guess he was concerned I wasn't a low enough handicapper to play off the blue or black tees which is silly because the course isn't tough from any tee. He also told us to speed up because we had a hole and a half ahead of us but when  we teed off we never saw a group ahead of us and people weren't waiting behind us so he did the typical ranger power trip and ended up disturbing myself and my group by making us speed up when we didn't need to.

While it may be considered a weak sister to its relative down the road, Vista Verde, the Ranch track at Tonto Verde is a great golf course for a great price.   I would imagine Tonto Verde's other offering, the Peaks course, is just as good albeit a bit pricier.  



The Ranch was in excellent shape and has matured nicely from the overseed in October.   The course is very straightforward; in fact, I cannot recall a single blind shot.  Fairways were lush and the tee boxes were impeccable.  The greens were in excellent shape and rolled fast but true.  As others have noted, the fairways are wide and very forgiving for the higher handicap golfer.  But don't be fooled:  Strategically placed bunkers can and will wreak havoc on errant shots.  At 7,000 yards from the tips, the course offers a wide variety of long and short par 4s and par 3s and plays for the most part as target golf. 



The service at Tonto Verde was very personable and attentive.  As with most resort courses, the staff does all the work, from placing your bag in the desired cart to cleaning up your clubs after the round. The clubhouse is very nice and the locker rooms are well kept and clean.  Rangers do show up from time to time to chart the pace of play.

ts252,4/9/2009,revtest4999,3,"The Place

From the outside there is nothing striking about Sullivan's Pier - it seems that the family took over a previous fast food restaurant?  Inside is decorated with naval/seafaring trinkets from nets, to crabbing traps, to lamps, and anchors.  The tables down the center of the restaurant are also really cool.  The clear table top has sand, shells, and assorted other beach-combing dried things underneath.  It makes for an interesting conversation piece.  The odd thing is that the tables seemed about 9-12 inches too short for the booths they were between.  Not a big deal, but it felt weird.



The Food

I ordered the fish & chips ""special"" with Alaskan White Fish, french fries, and a drink for $5.  The fish and chips were both served hot and crispy, just as they should be, but otherwise it was unremarkable.  The batter was really crunchy, which some may like, but I prefer the ""beer battered"" crispy and airy type of fried fish.  The fish was thin, in my mind too thin for proper fish & chips, if I go back I'll try the cod which should be larger chunks.  The chips were standard fries, nothing out of the ordinary.  There were plenty of sauces to dip your crispy bits in; tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, spicy ketchup, ketchup, malt vinegar, and maybe one or two more.  My daughter wasn't sure about the fried fish, so we ordered her a piece of grilled salmon.  Then she tried my fish and decided she liked it, and proceeded to eat half of it - she's learned well from her mommy.  :)  The salmon was dry and tough - overcooked for sure.  I think it's on the menu for them that don't want fried food, to which I would counter, why are you going to a chipper?



The Bottom Line

The value proposition is there, for $5 you get fish, chips, and a drink, and come away satisfied.  I'm still in search for the same quality of fish & chips I experienced in Ireland ... which I may not find here in AZ.  If you're in the mood for fish & chips, try Sullivan's Pier - it will satisfy the itch - and it's a family run operation so you can feel warm and fuzzy that you're helping keep more money in state.

There are only two options at this place that are on par with some of the best carne asada or red chicken you'll get from a carniceria. Seeing how the only options are chicken or beef (Or both! Go wild!), it's probably not the best place to bring a leaf eater. They'll be stuck munching on marinated onions, since I'm pretty sure the tortillas and pinto beans have got a lovely amount of lard in them, plus their senses will be assaulted by the delicious smell of succulent, juicy grilled meat. That smell by the way can be detected throughout the strip mall this place is located in, and without a fail gets me salivating whenever I walk by. 



Everything is prepared lightening fast and you can eat in the place or get your food to go. The combos are dirt cheap and delicious, at four bucks for a 1/4 beef or chicken, and seven bucks for the combination of the two. Each combo comes with two torillas, pinto beans, salsa and maninated onions. Half and whole chickens or piles of beef are also available for extremely reasonable prices.

Speed of service is hit or miss, I don't recommend coming here during any kind of football event but most times it is relatively quick. Just sit down and brush up on your spanish with an El Voz or read the College Times.

The main attraction was the beef.  It was so good, I didn't want it to end.  It was one of those moments where I hadn't eaten all day, and when I dove it, I was silent.  I wouldn't have answered my phone.

BEST Grilled Chicken and Carne Asada EVER!!!



They only serve grilled (beyond marinated) chicken on the bone and carne asada.  Both of which you may order 1/4, 1/2 or the combo with BOTH (all come with corn or flour tortillas)!  Which explains why such greatness that is 5 stars is involved in the concentration on 2 main items.



Now on to the main points:



-Meal will set you back only $4 to $6 bones per person, cash only



-Chicken may be ordered white or dark and is the most flavorful and crispy grilled, ignore the red-dyed skin, it will be the best grilled chicken you have ever had



-Carne Asada is always cooked to perfection, not overcooked or stringy or chewy, always is Carne Asada greatness



-Not only do meals come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, they come with perfectly salted pinto beans (not refried), fresh salsa, and red onions that seems to have been soaked (not pickled) reducing their flavor to a delicious subtle onion instead of a crunchy onion.



-Salsa is a tomatoey, pureed (not over pureed), juicy salsa that screams freshness with every bite.

ts56,11/18/2009,revtest5011,4,"I ate dinner at El Pollo Supremo after reading about the place on Yelp.  I love grilled chicken and this place knows how to grill.  The chicken was lightly spiced and the skin had a red color.  At competing grilled chicken places the chicken is served luke warm, or cool.  This chicken was HOT and juicy.  The meat was tender and separated from the bone easily.  



The beans and tortillas were tasty.  Tortillas were warm and heated on a stove not a microwave.  Yum Yum!



Carne Asada stands for 'grilled meat'.  Usually a skirt steak.  Prepared by a skilled griller (I know griller is not a word but it should be)  the meat is tender, and juicy.  When prepared by an amateur it can be used for shoe leather, or cheap tires.  The griller at El Pollo Supremo is an artist.  Two folks could split a combo dinner easily.  



El Pollo Supremo is in a small strip mall.  Upon entering the restaurant you place your order at the counter and can take a look at the small kitchen where the magic happens.  The place is old.  The fixtures and tables are old.  Nothing wrong with old, it just sort of hard to keep old stuff clean.  The proprietors do a good job of keeping the place neat and clean.    



The reason for only four stars is their drink policy.  They charge for refills.  I can see charging for refills on Horchata but not Pepsi.  It's a minor thing, maybe I'm too cheap!

The gentlemen manning the grill deserves an award for the magic he performs daily. 



Chicken:

Very Mexican influenced marinade. Heavy on the garlic, black pepper, and citrus. Pair that with the smokiness you get from charbroiling something over a real fire and its as good as your imagining it. They also add an unnatural bright red dye to it. Not sure exactly why they do this but whatever its.. umm.. festive?



Steak:

Delicious grilled carne asada just as it should be. The beef has just enough fat to keep it moist without being greasy.



Salsa:

I don't love it but only because I don't like fresh tomatoes. They puree fresh tomatoes to create the salsa. Everyone who has tried it loves it. Just not something I ever like anywhere.



Beans:

Whole pinto beans. Hard to say if they are home made or canned. I would guess they are probably canned but still good and not overly salty.



Flour Tortillas:

Warm, soft, mmmmm.



Onions:

They are pickled/marinaded which takes away some of the sharpness of the raw onion. Great addition to your hand made burritos.

This is a rediculously delish barbeque place. Don't let the name confuse you. It really is more of a grilled food place then a Mexican restaurant. Their menu is very simple. You basically have a choice between 1. chicken, 2. beef, or 3. beef and chicken. I recommend getting number 3. It's under 7 dollars and comes w/ beans and tortillas (corn or flour).

ts56,7/9/2010,revtest5021,2,"I haaaate being the guy that gives a 2 star review for something people are crazy about.  I've been actively wanting to try El Pollo Supremo for about 2 months now, and finally got around to it this afternoon, and was quite let down. 

First, I was a bit taken aback by the price..

Nearly $12 for a quartered chicken, and nearly $15 (yes.. Fifteen!) for around 12 oz of carne asada (each come with boring beans and some 3rd party tortillas. Also.. salsa that could be jarred by Gerber).. 

Once I got home with the goods, and saw the portion sizes, my skepticism grew stronger, and for good reason.... 

SALTY. Incredibly salty. Toxic saltiness. I'm not a wuss either.. if something has unhealthy levels of anything in it, I'm usually a huge fan. This was not enjoyable. Then came the Carne Asada.. far less salty than the chicken, but still pretty intense... it was OK. I've had worse carne asada.. but I've also had way better. It really needed some good fresh pico de gallo to kinda crisp up the otherwise gummy meat... This is the first time I feel that yelp has steered me wrong... not bad, considering how many WIN places I've found otherwise :)

****Also- looking at the picture of the menu, their combo prices seem to be a MUCH better value than just purchasing full chickens, or full orders of Carne asada!",negative
ts56,8/3/2010,revtest5022,5,"For any poor basterd who thinks that ""the Crazy Chicken"" is good, i say try this chicken who isnt so crazy (or expensive) and your sox will be rocked!

El Pollo grabs el pollo loco by the throat and stangles it into submission. if these two restaurants were in a cock fight you'd be foolish to place your money on the corporate backed ""crazy"" bird!

Previous Yelpers have summed it up pretty nicely; The charbroiled red skinned chicken is roasted to perfection and the carne asada is grilled but not so much to make it tough, retaining its lovely hue of pink in the middle. 

The combo plate is by far your best choice, giving you the advantage of both their delicious cow and bird meat on the same plate with accoutrements of sauteed red onions, pinto beans, and a uniquely homemade salsa fresca. Your choice of flour or corn tortilla.

The chicken is unlike any other i have had, the skin is crispy and delicious and a crimson colour which screams eat me!

Since it was my first time there I got the combo, which includes two pieces of chicken (breast and leg), and a decent portion of carne asada. Both were amazing, but the star here is the restaurant's name-sake. The chicken was moist, tender, salty (in a good way) and just all-around flavorful... and the crunchy skin was delicious.



I ended up eating the chicken by itself and saved the soft, doughy, warm tortillas for the carne asada. It also came with a side of salsa, onions and pinto beans. The pinto beans were nothing to be shrugged off either, probably some of the best I've ever had.



I am now left stuffed and happy - and all for about 8 bucks. I think I could easily go back and probably just get the chicken sometime and be just as satisfied for even less money.... or the carne asada when I'm in the mood for that. Either way, I'll definitely be back.",positive

Two stories, one funny, one stupid:



Tempe Urban Legend: At one point El Pollo Supremo had a fire. The staff of East Side Records (RIP) had to evacuate as well as they shared a wall. As the firefighters arrived, one turned to the other and exclaimed, ""We have to save this place! Their chicken is awesome!"" Don't you want to eat at a place that the Fire Department is desperate to save?



As I was standing around bullshitting outside a friends shop in Tempe one day, a girl in her early twenties was hanging out as well. The smell of the grills at El Pollo wafted over and she asked, ""What is that place? Smells good!"" ""El Pollo Supremo"" I said, ""Mexican Barbecue."" ""Oh I hate Mexican food!"" she said...too dumb to listen to her own nose! 



Tip: Don't ever let racism get in the way of eating at a place that your own nose tells you is good!



My favorite part about El Pollo Supremo is that they have chicken or beef. No substitutions is up on the menu, I am not sure what you'd substitute though as there is also a half chicken half beef option. Tortillas, red onions (eerily red), beans and salsa come with your chicken and beef.  Get some Horchata, do it right!",positive

SunnyD (he went to ASU so he was into the local flavor) insisted that we come here. I was a bit unsure as  everyone was throwing out suggestions like, hamburgers or italian but he stood staunch in his belief that i would love it.



So, we went solo.



Hmmm...things to note:



It's not fancy.

It's next to a smoke ""accessory"" store 

When we got there, it was a little after the lunch rush and way before dinner time.  it wasn't packed (actually, i think during the time we were there, there  was one guy who was eating, a few people who came in to pick up their to-go orders and maybe a couple or two who were coming in as we were leaving)



It's pretty low-key.

There's a menu. It states exactly what they've got (chicken or steak, i think were the only options)

you get beans, marinated onions and salsa with every order along with your choice of flour/corn tortillas.

I got the 1/4 chicken w/ flour, SunnyD got the 1/2 w/corn.



HOLY MOLY!  once the order arrived at my table, I noticed two things.

1. i don't usually like onions but i love pickled/marinated onions (and that's what they give you, the slightly vinegary yumminess takes the bite out of onions so they are just perfect without having an oniony smell!)

2. they char the skin on the chicken just perfect so there's no layer of fat and it's just all crispy skin goodness with a juicy marinated to the bone goodness when it comes to the meat.



i ate everything. i literally tried to get as much meat off the bones as I could. I like beans but hello....the chicken....was....heavenly.

i could have eaten about another 1/4 (let's be honest, another 1/2 chicken easily)



SunnyD made good on his chicken and ate the whole thing too. I think the next time, we can def. go with a whole chicken and maybe another 1/2. 



It's so good that if SunnyD were to ever ask me to drive out to Tempe from OC to just dine on that chicken again, i would gas up and hit the road.  



So bottom line. It's kind of like el pollo loco (but sooooo much better) but more authentic, in a more hole in the wally place that does chicken the way it's supposed to be done.

OK, to reiterate, this is a hole-in-the-wall. That means you should have no expectations about things looking remotely nice.

The talented and tasty apple doesn't fall far from the tree in that family. 



So-- the FOOD. The chicken is marinated in baby kisses and rainbows before it is mesquite grilled, and I hear the onions are pickled in jalapeno juice and vinegar. Together, that makes these two items alone truly the most delightful combination that man has ever known. I definitely recommend extra onions. The beef is nothing to scoff at-- it's seasoned, thinly sliced and tender.  The beans are beans.

Their food is simple, inexpensive, cooked traditionally, and very unique.



I almost always order 1/4 chicken and sort of developed a ritual way of eating it:

I take my fork and strip the bits of chicken from the bones.

I take my onions and spread them into the chicken pieces. 

(If the pieces are too big, I break them apart with my hands.)

**Wash your hands first before eating, its more fun to use your hands!**

Finally I take my tortillas, tear off little strips, and use them to make little bites. 

You can take your fork and top of off with some of that delicious salsa.



Each bite has all these flavors, and its really delicious.



The restaurant itself is very small and plain, and almost a tad dingy if you ask me, but not dirty. Its not a place to take someone on a first date, but its a fun and cheap place to go to on a regular basis for some food you'll always crave, and will never change!

The steak has been consistently pleasant and is quite tasty, moreso on its own than when mixed with the other ingredients.  The beans are always plain and the watery salsa certainly isn't anything to write home about, but it all works in that way that simple, decent ""comfort"" food should.  



As for price, it's certainly not as ""cheap"" as some make it seem, but it won't break the bank, either.  Figure $10-$12 per person and everyone's belly will leave happy.  The best value is to grab a few friends and split a couple items.  If you've got a picky date, this is the perfect place to take them, because they'll only have to make one decision...chicken or beef!



Please note that there is really nothing ""wrong"" with El Pollo Supremo.  However, there is nothing particularly outstanding about it, either.  



The 5-star and ""100%"" ratings across the internet review boards are certainly more than it deserves.  People in Phoenix seem to have a skewed idea of what ""good"" Mexican food is and have a habit of glorifying mediocrity whenever possible.  This place received a ""Best of Phoenix"" award for 2011...that just proves my point!  Since we're just tossing acclamations out there, I'll give El Pollo Supremo the ""Best of Mediocre"" for 2012.  Now on to the next joint...",negative

ts56,11/5/2012,revtest5064,5,"Oh my tasty goodness!  This very small and basic hole in the wall restaurant is cash only, and so worth it.  I go with the combo of steak & chicken.  I love the pickled onions & the salsa tastes just like my Tata used to make.  Although I feel like the flour tortillas are a little undercooked, they are still delicious.  No frills, no fuss, just good food.  I will absolutely be a regular here.",positive
ts56,11/11/2012,revtest5065,3,"It was my first time here, so the nice counter lady said I should try the combo deal for $7.99. I had to minus a star for the carne asada because the majority of pieces were too chewy to consume and some slices had fat on the ends. So with that meat eliminated, I moved on to the chicken, which came in a red version and was the highlight of this joint. The two-piece all-white was one breast and one tiny wing, but I thought i was getting two breasts. I could have used that extra big piece of chicken too because my last of the giant three tortillas had nothing to put into it after the tasty first piece didn't last long. Best side dish was probably the marinated onions and the forementioned tortillas. Crispy skin on the chicken also, so I will return for more pollo por favor.",negative
ts56,11/14/2012,revtest5066,4,"This place is weird, and not what I expected by the reviews on here. You order some tacos, and they give you the cooked stuff to make them yourself. Nothing prepped, chicken still on the bone. Delicious food though, just weird...",positive
