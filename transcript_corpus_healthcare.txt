Today I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss some of the key milestones we anticipate for the remainder of 2017. ||| I'll start with our hem-onc programs, where we continue to make significant progress with both Imbruvica and Venclexta
Starting with Imbruvica, as we've outlined, expanding into new indications is an important driver of future growth ||| Earlier this year we added relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma to our growing list of approved uses, and we continue to make progress with other indications as well
During the quarter, we submitted a supplemental new drug application for the use of Imbruvica in patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease who failed prior systemic therapy
