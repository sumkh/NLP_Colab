Today I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss some of the key milestones we anticipate for the remainder of 2017.
I'll start with our hem-onc programs, where we continue to make significant progress with both Imbruvica and Venclexta

Starting with Imbruvica, as we've outlined, expanding into new indications is an important driver of future growth

Earlier this year we added relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma to our growing list of approved uses, and we continue to make progress with other indications as well

During the quarter, we submitted a supplemental new drug application for the use of Imbruvica in patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease who failed prior systemic therapy

GVHD is a severe and potentially life-threatening complication that can occur in patients who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant

There are currently limited treatment options for this disease, and if approved, Imbruvica would be the first and only therapy specifically indicated for chronic GVHD

In Phase 2 data presented at the end of last year, 67% of patients who failed steroid therapy responded to treatment with Imbruvica, with one-third of the responders achieving a complete response and almost two-thirds substantially reducing steroid use

Based on these data, we expect a regulatory decision in the second half of the year

Later this year, we anticipate several key data readouts for Imbruvica, including data from an interim analysis in front-line mantle cell lymphoma, as well as additional potential interim analyses in other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

Moving now to Venclexta

We're expecting data from the MURANO study evaluating the combination of Venclexta and Rituxan later this year, which we believe will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL and help establish Venclexta as a foundational therapy in this patient population

The Phase 3 program evaluating Venclexta in front-line CLL is also ongoing, with studies been run in younger, more fit patients as well as older patients with comorbidities

These studies, as well as other combination studies with Imbruvica, are important parts of the Venclexta strategy to drive toward chemo-free regimens in CLL

We anticipate key data from the CLL14 study in older patients with comorbid medical conditions to be available in 2018.
Beyond our core strategy in CLL, we are making great progress with our development programs to expand Venclexta across multiple hematologic malignancies

We have Phase 3 studies ongoing in multiple myeloma as well as AML, where we have received Breakthrough Therapy Designation

And these studies are progressing well, with key data becoming available in the 2019 timeframe

Later this year, we are also expecting additional data readouts from Phase 2 studies in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which will inform decisions regarding advancement in these indications

I'll now turn to our solid tumor programs, where we continue to make good progress with our late-stage programs, Rova-T and ABT-414, as well as with our early-stage oncology pipeline

Starting with Rova-T, our registrational trial in third-line-plus small cell lung cancer, the TRINITY study, continues to progress nicely, and we expect data later this year

Our submission will follow soon thereafter, enabling a commercial launch in 2018.
In addition to TRINITY, we have a comprehensive development program in place for Rova-T to evaluate this promising therapy in earlier lines of treatment in small cell lung cancer, as well as in other tumor types that express DLL3.
The Rova-T program includes additional studies currently underway in small cell lung cancer, including MARU, a Phase 3 study evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting, and a mid-stage combination study evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and â€“ with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer

And this quarter, we will also start the TAHOE study, a Phase 3 trial in second-line small cell lung cancer

Beyond small cell lung cancer, the neuroendocrine tumor basket study is progressing nicely, and we anticipate beginning to see early data from this study towards the end of this year

As we've discussed, the acquisition of Stemcentrx not only provided AbbVie a late-stage asset in Rova-T, but brought a highly attractive discovery and early development platform as well

In addition to Rova-T, we have four Stemcentrx assets in the clinic, and we are on track to transition several additional programs into human trials this year, adding to our growing oncology pipeline, which includes more than 35 late preclinical or early clinical stage assets

Beyond Rova-T and our other Stemcentrx assets, we're continuing to make progress with our solid tumor programs, including our antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme, ABT-414, which was granted Fast Track Designation earlier this month

At the upcoming ASCO meeting, we plan to present full data from the Phase 1 study of ABT-414 in glioblastoma, including overall survival and progression-free survival data

And later this year, we'll see data from the Phase 2 study in second line GBM that, if positive, would support regulatory submission

In our early-stage oncology pipeline, we continue to build capabilities and explore new technologies that will extend our reach in the solid tumor market

We're making good progress with our next-generation immuno-oncology programs and other novel approaches such as our bispecific technology, with a number of assets having recently entered the clinic and more study starts expected through the remainder of 2017.
Moving now to our HCV program, where we recently received priority review from the FDA for our pan-genotypic next-generation HCV therapy

In the quarter we also received EMA accelerated assessment and priority review in Japan

Last week at the International Liver Congress we presented new results from our Phase 3 program, including data from the EXPEDITION-1 and ENDURANCE-3 studies, which together with previously reported data reinforce our next-generation therapies' potential to provide high cure rates and a shorter treatment duration for the majority of patients across all genotypes, including patients with compensated cirrhosis and those with genotype 3 infection

Results from EXPEDITION-1 demonstrated that 99% of patients with compensated cirrhosis achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment across genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
We also presented data from ENDURANCE-3 in patients with genotype 3, the second most common (16:22-16:33) genotype globally and the most challenging to treat

These results showed that with just eight weeks of treatment, 95% of genotype 3 patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment achieved SVR12 with our next-generation therapy

We're excited about the high cure rates across all major genotypes and the results in difficult-to-treat patients that we've seen in our Phase 3 program, and remain confident that our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free HCV therapy will be competitively positioned within this market

We remain on track for regulatory approval in the U.S

, EU, and Japan later this year

Moving now to our immunology programs, where we have two very promising late-stage assets, risankizumab and ABT-494, each with the potential to significantly advance standard of care in a number of immune-mediated conditions

Risankizumab, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim, has the potential to provide best-in-class efficacy and increased dosing convenience with quarterly administration

Results from the Phase 2 study of risankizumab in psoriasis were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine

These data show that selective blockade of IL-23 with risankizumab was associated with a superior clinical response compared to Stelara

In this study, approximately 2.5 times as many patients achieved PASI 100 with risankizumab compared with those receiving Stelara

The Phase 3 program in psoriasis is well underway, and we look forward to seeing data from three of the pivotal studies later this year, with commercialization expected in 2019.
Earlier this month, we also published results from a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study of risankizumab in Crohn's disease

Results from this study show that patients receiving risankizumab achieved higher clinical and endoscopic remission rates than placebo, suggesting that blocking IL-23 could be a very promising therapeutic approach in Crohn's disease

52-week data from the open-label maintenance portion of this trial will be shared in a late-breaking oral presentation at the upcoming DDW meeting in May

Phase 3 studies in Crohn's disease will be starting soon

This year we'll also see Phase 2 data in psoriatic arthritis, with Phase 3 studies expected to begin in the first half of 2018.
Additionally, we are expecting to begin a Phase 2 for risankizumab in ulcerative colitis in the second half of the year

Moving now to our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, where we continue to make significant progress with our development programs in RA and inflammatory bowel diseases

At the upcoming DDW meeting, we'll be presenting data from the Phase 2 CELEST study in Crohn's disease, showing that treatment with ABT-494 demonstrated endoscopic improvement and clinical benefit as induction therapy in patients with moderate to severe refractory Crohn's disease

Based on these strong Phase 2 results, we'll be initiating a Phase 3 program later this year

We have two additional mid-stage programs for ABT-494, including an ongoing Phase 2 study in atopic dermatitis and a soon-to-begin Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis

Turning our attention to rheumatoid arthritis, we expect to begin seeing data from the first of six Phase 3 RA studies in the coming months, with top-line data from the SELECT-NEXT trial in patients who have failed conventional DMARDs expected in June, and data from the SELECT-BEYOND study in biologic inadequate responders expected later in the summer

We plan to present full data from both of these studies at a medical meeting later this year

We believe ABT-494 has the potential to be best-in-class with an optimized benefit risk profile, and we are particularly excited about this asset's potential in the difficult-to-treat anti-TNF inadequate responder population, a growing segment of the RA market representing roughly 35% of the biologic treated population

And finally, in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of the Phase 3 program for elagolix in endometriosis and are on track for regulatory submission next quarter

In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase 3 studies underway in uterine fibroids

This program is investigating the effect of elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition

We anticipate beginning to see data from this Phase 3 program late in the year

Earlier this month we presented detailed results from the Phase 2 study in uterine fibroids at the meeting of the Society of Endometriosis and Uterine Disorders

These data demonstrated that treatment with elagolix provided superior efficacy and rapid control of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids compared to placebo, as well as improved quality of life

Treatment with elagolix was well tolerated, with hormonal add-back therapy substantially attenuating the side effects of elagolix on bone mineral density and hot flashes

Importantly, there were no abnormal endometrial findings, demonstrating that elagolix has potential as a chronic, uninterrupted treatment for this condition

We remain excited about this potential new medicine for women with both of these highly prevalent conditions, where there are few effective treatment options

So in summary, we've continued to see significant evolution of our mid- and late-stage pipelines, and we look forward to many important data readouts, phase transitions, regulatory submissions, and approvals later this year

With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance

Jeff, this is Mike

I'll take the first part of that question

So obviously we've been following the situation very, very closely

Of course, we don't have access to the complete response letter or knowledge of Lilly's conversation with regulators

But we do have a very clear understanding of our own program, our own data, and our own extensive conversations with regulators here in the U.S

and in major jurisdictions around the world

And based on that, we remain confident in our program and don't see any read-through from the Lilly situation

We've designed a very comprehensive and robust Phase 3 program that will thoroughly characterize the efficacy and safety profile of both of the doses of ABT-494 that are being studied in Phase 3.
And we remain confident in the data that we've seen, our Phase 2 data, we're very strong not only from an efficacy, but also from a safety perspective

An important issue here is dose selection, and we designed a very robust Phase 2b program that explored a wide range of doses across different patient populations, because dose response is not necessarily the same in an earlier population or an TNF-inadequate responder population, for example

And we ran Phase 2 studies in both of those patient populations

That allowed us to select doses that we think optimize benefit/risk, and as I said, we've designed a Phase 3 program that will fully demonstrate that benefit/risk and support regulatory decisions

So our level of confidence or enthusiasm on ABT-494 remains high and hasn't changed a bit this past week

So, this is Mike

I'll take that question

We feel very good about the data that we've generated across the program and across genotypes

If you look at our response rates, they're very high across both the common and uncommon genotypes, and in particular in some of the most difficult to treat patient populations, like genotype 3.
And so, while it's difficult to speculate about a label, we think that the evidence that we've generated strongly supports pan-genotypic use of the product

And with respect to the eight-week data, I would make similar statements

The eight-week data have been very strong across genotypes, including in very difficult to treat patients like genotype 3 patients

There, it's been studied in genotype 3 patients at eight weeks who don't have cirrhosis and are new to therapy, but that's a very, very significant portion of the market, not only in the U.S

but around the world

And our results are very strong, and again, while it's difficult to speculate about a label this early in the process, we think the data supports the use of the regimen in that manner

Okay, this is Mike, I'll take the question about Rova-T and TRINITY

So what we know about small cell lung cancer is that treatment options are severely limited for these patients

We know that in the front-line setting, we can drive good response rates with traditional chemotherapy, but those responses aren't durable and patients relapse

And when they relapse, they're very, very difficult to treat

Second and subsequent lines of therapy have much lower response rates and very poor durability of those responses

In the third-line setting, where we're conducting the TRINITY study, for example, one-year survival is at best 12%, and many experts would put that number lower

So what we're looking for in TRINITY is something that really changes that picture, something that shows response rates that are different from the chemotherapy options and clearly differentiated â€“ chemotherapy drugs response rates in the teens here â€“ and responses that have the promise of being durable, and increasing that long-term survival to the greatest extent possible

And you asked about our confidence

We remain confident in Rova-T and TRINITY

Rova-T is supported by a very, very strong package of preclinical biology and early clinical data

And this is a situation where the early clinical data are predictive of TRINITY

We're essentially looking at the same endpoints in TRINITY that we did in the early studies

So we feel good about that asset and about the overall Stemcentrx pipeline

Okay

This is Mike, I'll take those take questions

With respect to the risankizumab data, if we look at the Phase 2b data for risankizumab, it shows the strongest observed results in the category, which would include the IL-17s and the IL-23s

We had very high PASI 90 response numbers and very high PASI 100s, so complete clearance of skin disease in that program

And there were other features about the data that were very striking

First, we had very good durability response, and there's a very good administration, with the ability to drive quarterly administration in our Phase 3 program

So basically what we're looking for is a result in Phase 3 that is consistent with those Phase 2 data

The other thing I'd point out, with respect to other agents, is we run active comparators in our Phase 2b, now that's against Stelara not against the IL-17s, but we saw very high PASI 100 rates there

And as I pointed in out in my prepared remarks, PASI 100 was about 2.5 times higher for risankizumab as compared to Stelara in that Phase 2, and the results of PASI 90 were similar, that there were substantially higher PASI 90 response rates, about double that of Stelara

So we feel good about the competitive profile and the ability to drive that through Phase 3 and into the market

With respect to Crohn's disease, the data that we've seen are very encouraging

We're moving very fast already

So I'm not sure if the data at DDW accelerate that, but we're poised to move into Phase 3 and we feel that there's a lot of potential for this pathway in inflammatory bowel diseases as well

So with respect to the framework that Rick laid out, we have a number of opportunities to move forward in lines of therapy

And one that we would expect to see data on later this year is mantle cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where we're anticipating interim data from a pivotal study in front-line, which would be an important step towards moving to front-line therapy there

In mantle cell, we also have combination work ongoing with Venclexta, and that combination has shown very strong results

And so those data would continue to mature over the course of the timeframe that you described

We're also going to see data in other forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma over the course of the next 18 or 24 months, including data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where we've seen good results in patients who have the ABC or activated B-cell phenotype of that disease, and also additional work in follicular lymphoma, which is the largest form of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma

Outside of NHL, we're making good progress with GVHD

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have the initial submission in but we have ongoing data generation in GVHD

So all of those data will mature over the course of the timeframe that you described

And then, at the back end of that two-year period, we'll start to see more data on multiple myeloma and other opportunities as well

So with respect Veliparib, as we've said on other occasions, we were exploring a different hypothesis with Veliparib

We know that Veliparib â€“ or we know that PARP inhibitors play a role in treating patients with inherited mutations in DNA repair, germline BRCA mutation and similar mutations

But we didn't view it as a substantial opportunity for a company like AbbVie to come third or fourth to market in that population

Essentially, the medical need was met for those patients

So we were testing a different hypothesis, and that hypothesis specifically was whether PARP inhibition would augment DNA-damaging chemotherapy; that the first hit, if you will, didn't have to be genetic, that it could from that DNA-damaging chemotherapy

We've now seen across a couple of studies that that hasn't played out in the way we had initially envisioned

We see that in the triple-negative breast cancer neoadjuvant study and in the squamous non-small cell lung cancer study

And so, while that's not the result we had hoped for, we knew going in that this was a higher-risk, higher-reward sort of approach, and that the evidence while reasonable, from a preclinical and early clinical perspective, isn't entirely predictive in this setting

And so we knew that it was going to take Phase 3 data to answer the question

We've seen the first two readouts, and those studies did not meet their primary endpoint

With respect to ongoing work, we have ongoing studies, some of which will read out very soon

So we can't speculate about what those results might be, but we will complete the ongoing studies and update you on the progress as soon as possible

Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay

Thanks, Mike

We are very pleased with our second quarter performance

Total net revenues were $6.9 billion, up 8.9% operationally, excluding a 90 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange

We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.42, up 12.7% compared to the second quarter of 2016 and exceeding our guidance for the quarter

HUMIRA had another outstanding quarter, with global sales of $4.7 billion, up 14.9% operationally

This performance is reflective of continued strong demand, despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs as well as anti-TNF biosimilars

, HUMIRA sales increased 18% compared to the prior year, driven by low double-digit prescription growth plus price

Wholesaler inventory levels were below half a month, as is our standard practice

HUMIRA's growth continues to be fueled by robust demand across all three segments, rheum, gastro and derm, and market share remains stable despite competitive dynamics

Internationally, HUMIRA had an exceptional quarter, with operational sales growth of 9.1%

This performance was driven by market growth as well as tender timing, which contributed nearly 2 percentage points to operational sales growth in the quarter

Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the second quarter were $626 million, up more than 42% over the second quarter of last year

, which totaled $528 million in the quarter, were driven by our strong market positions in CLL as well as other indications, including mantle cell lymphoma, WaldenstrÃ¶m's and relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which was approved earlier this year

Global Viekira sales in the quarter were $225 million, down versus the prior year

In the coming weeks, we expect U.S

and European regulatory decisions for our next-generation HCV treatment, MAVIRET

Based on the timing of reimbursement decisions outside the U.S

and managed-care contracting cycles in the U.S

, we expect to see meaningful sales contribution from MAVIRET starting in 2018.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 16% on an operational basis in the quarter

And we also saw strong growth from Creon, which was up over 9% in the quarter

Reviewing the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 82.3% of sales compared to 81.9% in the prior year

This was inclusive of 80 basis points of dilutive impact related to partnership accounting

Adjusted R&D was 17.5% of sales, up 200 basis points over the prior year, reflecting increased funding of the pipeline, including incremental spend associated with the Stemcentrx and risankizumab transactions

Adjusted SG&A was 20.2% of sales in the quarter, down 200 basis points versus the prior year, driven by sales leverage and operational efficiencies

Operating margin was 44.6% of sales in the second quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points versus prior year

Net interest expense was $253 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 19.3% in the quarter

Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.42, up 12.7% year-over-year

Turning to full year guidance, we continue to forecast full year adjusted EPS of $5.44 to $5.54 per share, representing growth of 13.9% at the midpoint

This guidance comprehends full year top-line operational growth approaching 10%

HUMIRA, we continue to expect mid to high teens sales growth for the full year

Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for HUMIRA

Given recent foreign exchange dynamics, we would expect full year reported sales growth for international HUMIRA to approach mid-single digits

For IMBRUVICA, we remain on track to achieve our full year expectation for global reported revenues of greater than $2.4 billion, with sales in the U.S

of more than $2 billion

In the last several weeks, we have seen a weakening of the dollar versus key foreign currencies

If these rates were to remain constant at today's levels, we would forecast no material impact from foreign exchange to full year sales

This currency movement would, however, have an adverse impact on gross margin due to hedges in place on key currencies

If exchange were to hold at current rates, we would forecast full year gross margin as a percentage of sales at 80.5%

We are forecasting full year R&D expense approaching 17.5% of sales, reflecting pipeline funding and the impacts of the Stemcentrx and risankizumab transactions

We expect SG&A of over 20.5% of sales, and this would result in an operating margin profile of approximately 42.5%, inclusive of the recent impact of currency movements

We continue to expect a net interest expense of approximately $1 billion

And the adjusted tax rate for the full year should be modeled at above 19%

For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.36 and $1.38.
This adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.22 of non-cash amortization and other specified items and represents year-over-year growth of 13.2% at the midpoint

We are forecasting operational revenue growth of approximately 9% through the third quarter

And if current exchange rates hold, no impact from exchange on sales in the quarter

HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the third quarter in the high teens

Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for HUMIRA

For IMBRUVICA, we expect U.S

sales growth in the third quarter of approximately 30%

We expect gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately 80.5% of sales

This gross margin comprehends current exchange rates and is inclusive of the dilutive impact of partnered products

In closing, we delivered outstanding performance in the quarter, driven by our focus on strong commercial and operational execution

We expect to continue this momentum in the second half of 2017, putting us in a great position to deliver top-tier revenue and EPS growth for the full year

And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz

So, Marc, yeah, it was a nice quarter for gross margin

We've gone back and looked

Historically, Q2 does run a little stronger than the rest of the year

That's a function of product mix, to a certain extent

But that said, we continue to make pretty nice progress on this line, even in the face of the partnership accounting

If you back out partnership accounting, we are probably up about 120 basis points

Yeah, I think the main drivers, about a third of that was a favorable impact of exchange

But that still left 80 basis points to the good, and that was really a mix of product mix as well as just cost efficiencies

The royalty burden really lifts in two different phases

The first third of it lifts at the very end of 2017, so you see a P&L impact in 2018.
The other two-thirds lifts at the very end of 2018, so you see the P&L benefit in 2019.
And then in terms of quantity to model, we have said that that burden is about 5% to 6% of global HUMIRA sales

Okay

Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.66 at the high end of our guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth

We also raised midpoint of our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.48 to $2.50 which is at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year

Sales increased more than [technical difficulty] in the quarter led by strong performance in established pharmaceuticals and medical devices

At the beginning of the year, I commented that we were entering a period where innovation and new product launches when enhance our competitiveness and fortify our leading market positions

We're seeing this play out through the first three quarters of the year with significant growth contributions from several recently launched products and important advancements across our innovative new product pipeline

I'll highlight several examples as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian

I'll start with diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of more than 5% in the quarter which was led by strong international performance during the quarter

We continued the initial European launch of our Alinity family of systems, which now includes five recently launched instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening, hematology and Point of Care testing

As we've stated previously, our primary focus during this initial launch period has been to convert a number of long tenured Abbott customers to Alinity and we continue to make progress on that front across all of the major European countries

We continue to anticipate CE Mark for our Alinity molecular diagnostic systems in the coming months and expect to begin the launch of the Alinity instruments in the US in 2018.
During the quarter, we also announced our acquisition of Alere establishing Abbott, is the global leader in Point of Care testing

This combination creates the broadest Point of Care testing portfolio in the world with leading positions across cardio, metabolic, infectious disease and toxicology testing

In nutrition, sales grew very modestly in the quarter

And pediatric nutrition continued above market performance and the US was led by recently launched infant formula products and strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand

Internationally, we've seen some market stabilization in China and we prepare for the pending new food safety regulations that are set to go into effect on January 1 of next year

Outside of China as expected, we continue to see soft market conditions across few international markets and then adult nutrition international growth of 5.5% was led by our market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands

In established pharmaceuticals or EPD double-digit sales growth was led by strong performance across our key emerging markets including double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China

As expected and contemplated in our third quarter guidance, we saw a modest level of channel restocking in India after the implementation of a new tax system in that country on July 1, which contributed approximately 2.5 percentage points of growth in the quarter excluding this impact total EPD sales would have grown around 12% in the quarter

With our unique geographic footprint and business model as well as our scale and leading positions in several geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above market performance

And in medical devices sales growth was led by double-digit growth in heart failure, electrophysiology, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care

In addition to strong growth we achieved several important new product approvals and clinical trial milestones across our portfolio during the third quarter

In heart failure, we received US FDA approval and launched our HeartMate 3 pump which provides crucial support for advanced heart failure patients as they wait for their treatment including heart transplants

HeartMate 3 offers a number of advantages compared to existing options and further strengthens our global leadership position in this area

During the quarter, we also received US FDA approval of our MRI compatible ICD or implantable defibrillator which follows FDA approval of our MRI compatible pacemaker earlier this year

These approvals significantly enhance our competitive position in the US Cardiac Rhythm Management market

In structural heart, double-digit growth was driven by continued global uptick MitraClip

During the quarter we achieved several important clinical milestones including completion of enrolment in our US trial for Portico, our TAVR product and we began enrolling patients in a new tricuspid valve disease trial which utilizes our market leading transcatheter valve repair system

In Neuromodulation, we achieved growth of approximately 50% for the third consecutive quarter driven by recently launched products that offer improved relief for chronic pain patients and help for those suffering from movement disorders

With our broad portfolio of innovative solutions, we continue to advance our leadership position in this fast growing market

I'll wrap up with diabetes care, where international sales growth of nearly 35% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks

Libre now has more than 400,000 users internationally and during the quarter we obtained national reimbursement status in Japan and the United Kingdom which represent two of the largest diabetes markets in the world

In the US during the quarter, Libre received US FDA approval as a replacement for blood glucose monitoring

This revolutionary technology is the only system available that comes factory-calibrated thus eliminating the need for daily finger sticks that are required to calibrate other systems currently available

So in summary, we exceeded expectations for the quarter and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance which is now at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year

Our sales growth increased sequentially and recently launched products are contributing significant growth across our portfolio and we're particularly pleased with the productivity we're seeing across our new product pipeline which is delivering a study cadence of approvals and launches of innovative technologies

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more details

Yes, I think it's premature Mike to give real specific about Alere

We closed the deal a couple of weeks ago, literally

And our new management team is taking over the business, but obviously very rapidly getting up to speed, meeting all their employees and going through all the things you do to start integration and so forth

And I'd say first of all, that's gone very well

The management team we put in place has moved very quickly and I'd say very deliberately to get their hands around everything, but that takes some time

As we've said the people given the timing of when we close it, we expect no accretion this year

So I wouldn't look for any particular impact on the bottom line in 2017 and with regard to 2018, since our initial estimates of accretion that were quite some time ago, as you know when we first announced this deal because it's taken a very long time close

There have been a number of changes including divestitures and so forth

So I don't want to give you a specific number

I'd say it's fair to think that the accretion will be much more modest and what we have initially indicated for the first year

We will get a full year, we'll get a quarter's head start

And obviously our intent is to be accretive to our company and our business and we believe that with the acquisition we've positioned ourselves as the leader in Point of Care testing worldwide and all of that has the intent of good solid growth and profit growth for our investors, but I'm going to be cautious about what I communicate for 2018 at this point until we've really had a chance to assess it more thoroughly

I think it's a good target

I don't know that we know yet, but that's certainly I think an expectation we Abbott ought to have and the question is, how rapidly we can do that

Look I think it's a fair expectation and if I was and I'm totally honest with you

I wouldn't have a lesser expectation

Well I'd say couple of things

Your estimate is - let's just say your estimate I'll take

And you gave me a nice range there, so thank you

And I think that you can assume that we'll be looking at this from a lot of perspectives because we've got a lot of data

Having had a run rate in Europe, we launched in Europe and it basically went country-by-country

We started as full patient pay and we had really terrific uptake in consumer interest and that was the first introduction of Libre to the market

The fact that there was no reimbursement early on, was an unknown to us and it was a new concept and a new way for diabetics to test

And we experienced tremendous demand

Our first year, we were capacity limited and yet, we had a fair bit of demand

Second year, obviously has gone exceptionally well and so as I indicated we've got over 400,000 customers

It was remarkably well embraced for reimbursement by government bodies in Europe and regions in Germany etc

, that's extremely gratifying that the value proposition that we see with Libre is strong and it's intended to be

And consequently we believe that part of the appeal is not just, what Libre can do and the information that it provides to a diabetic was a very informed patient and a very self-managing patient

It provides them tremendous information, tremendous guidance in the management of diabetes and I know that first-hand, I wear one

And I got to say it's just a phenomenal device, it's a super product

I can see why consumers like it as much as they do and that's true for both Type I and Type II's and we're seeing that universally across the board, they use it in different ways or at least the information mean something to them in different ways

Whether they're managing insulin or whether they're managing diet and exercise and other things

So I'd say first of all, I expect demand to be pretty strong

Secondly, the US market knows about Libre, it knows a lot about Libre because of all the experience that we've had in the last year in Europe

So I do expect a more educated, ready, prepared, anticipating, demanding market in the US as it relates to payers, which I would call the second dimension of this

I think our value proposition is quite strong

The product is priced at a very economic and affordable level

The intention there is as much and broad access as possible and as rapidly as possible

And I think that value proposition is stunning compared to competitive offerings and I think that's going to be making it strong

We are in discussions with payers and we're in discussion with payers about that value proposition and I believe that will all go very well

I know that's not as much detail as you'd like to have, but it's as much I'm willing to share at this point because right now I would tell you we expect a good strong out of the block performance like you described and beyond that

I mean right now, Mike we're adding about 50,000 patients a quarter and that's across a continent that we had to go at one country at a time, one reimbursement system at a time

Of course the US is quite large, and Japan and UK as additions to this are also quite large

So I mean, we have a fair amount of optimism and trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves

Yes, I'd say a couple things Matt

First of all let me back up and give a bigger context to this

Over the course of the year, there was a lot of scepticism on the part of analyst end or investors about all the things that we had to get accomplished, that were back end loaded

A lot of third quarter, fourth quarter things and depending on how you're looking at it, it looks pretty daunting and we all know everything doesn't go right

And the Sylmar inspection put some of that in doubt

Now having said that, we stuck to our guns on what our estimates were and our projections were about when we would get product approvals and claim approvals, licensure approvals and so forth

And the third quarter alone here has been pretty gratifying in that

We basically got every approval we forecasted and let's call it, within 30 days or so of what we forecasted and I think that's been pretty gratifying, that what we said is what happened and that includes Libre, that includes the high voltage MRI claim, that includes HeartMate, it includes the closure of Alere, it includes Libre, it includes lot of things

I don't generally like being backend loaded because it feels like a lot of risk that everything has to go right, but everything did

And our progress with Sylmar is no exception as I've indicated on prior calls

Our team that has been working with the Sylmar team and so forth has done an exceptional job that we have provided all information, taken all actions, done all remediation, everything basically done on time, delivered to FDA, discussed with FDA etc

And at this point and we're just experiencing those new systems populating with new experience, new data, new decision making etc

and all of that is going exactly as planned, exactly as forecasted, exactly as communicated with the FDA and thus far without a hiccup and I think that's recognized by the FDA

I think it's recognized, they have discretion, they don't have to license new products out of that facility, but they have

And I think that is evidence of how we're progressing with Sylmar and the fact that the FDA is giving it all the scrutiny that they would and should and what we've submitted to them for approval has been given fair and objective consideration and we've gotten our approval so far

With that said, the remaining ones, I'm not going to change my estimates on

I'm not going to change what we forecasted

I have no reason to believe otherwise

They clearly have the discretion not to, but that's not been our experience and so consequently I remain optimistically that we're on track that we'll deliver what we said

Well I'll tell you what, I'm not sure

I would tell you this

First of all, we have product approvals we need

We're ready for the transition

Building inventory for such etc

So as far as responding to the new law and I think this is true for at least the large multinational competitors

I think most of us, if not all of us have our product approvals

We are ready for the transition etc

How we all manage that, who knows

But I think at least we are and I think others are, ready with new approved replacement products etc

as we've been required to do

So I think we're all ready for the transition on January 1.
What you can't know very well, at least about everybody else is how much inventory everybody has in various channels?
How long that transition will take for any given competitor and so forth

We are comfortable with our inventory levels were comfortable with our inventory levels both on current product and post January 1 product

So we're comfortable what we think we have to do with our own transition

What's hard to project is not just multinationals, but all the hundreds of other Chinese competitors that are faced with the same regulation

So I'd say we've seen a stabilizing of China, it hasn't been as choppy as it was in the last two years

I'd say our estimates around market growth are hard to pin down

We were more conservative on market growth than recent data we've seen

The market growth is better than we indicated or better than we believed or better than we thought and we're looking pretty closely at all the sources of our market data because there are many and they're not all perfectly comprehensive across all channels and then all sources of products or even all geography, so it's a hard win

China is a particularly difficult one to pin down because there are a number of channels, there are a lot of competitors, there are a lot of data sources, it's not like going to AC Nielsen in the US or something

So I'm cautious about it

I think we've seen the tough part and I think we're going back into a phase where it's the same kind of hand-to-hand competition, we've always had across multiple channels, I like that

I think that's better because at least then whether we do well or don't do well is a function of our execution, I haven't been particularly pleased with our execution and I don't exclude a number of other countries where we do see soft market conditions, but I also see less than great execution on our part

So this business is getting a lot of attention from us and from all of us top to bottom and it will get some attention

I think it's probably the one soft spot in our release

That make a lot of things you know are going awfully well as I just commented to you in the device area

But this one is going to get a lot more attention

I feel that China is at least reasonably stable or predictable

We haven't been right about the market growth rates

Those looked better than we expected, so that's a plus and I guess I would just leave it at there

Yes, I expect it to be accretive

We've got a lot of work to do, to identify our synergies and identify growth opportunities

We're going through reorganization of the business right now and I think that's actually going to be a plus

I don't want to describe how it was organized because I think that's kind of waste of time and it will take a long time, but we went through a restructuring of the old structure of St

Jude and we did it within six months and as you know organized in integrated business units that I'd say organization is still kind of setting, the glue is still kind of setting, but we move to within six months that might have been aggressive but the organization is very stable

The restructuring activities that we had to go through and a lot of synergizing as far as people go, we've gone through, changes and management we've gone through etc

But about the six month level at St

Jude it all got done in Alere in six days

So that's a running start

And we've announced what we're moving to, I think it's an organization like all organizations all people want to do well

They want to achieve, they want to grow, they want to be proud of the businesses they're running, they want to do well and I'd say, our early days with the employees of Alere have been positive and we announced that we're going to go to that kind of structure, we've announced how we're going to do it, why we're going to do it etc

and I think that's well received at this point

So as far as we look into 2018, I think your question about was half of that, a good placeholder

I'd say, yes it's a good placeholder

I can't tell you with any precision that that's what it will be, but I think it's a good placeholder

Well couple of things, first of all with regard to Sierra the same schedule, no change that will be first quarter of the year, we think

And with regard to Confirm, it's partly approved already

As you may understand it gets approved in pieces and so far, so good

There are some peripheral pieces we're waiting for approval on, but the first and very critical portion of that is approved

So yes I think that's - so far everything we've seen is very encouraging and no change

Well right now, that's what I bet on

I'm trying to think about how to sound conservative to you

Look, we got our acquisitions closed

We're going to have a number of product approvals that happened in the third quarter and fourth quarter that obviously should hit their stride

I mean ideally you look at 2018 and you'd like to have your product approvals exactly where we got them, going into next year

We've had a really good 2017, we beat all expectations not just in the numbers, but in the approvals

You all have to admit you had a lot of scepticism about some of this and maybe rightly so after 2016, but look we hit every target, we had for this and with all those approvals, one ought to think that, should bode positively for 2018.
That said, when we go through our budgeting every year it's kind of negotiating tussle with our managers around the world, about what's possible in their given market and so forth

But I think we ought to have pretty good momentum going into 2018 What can I say, all the organic R&D projects and system projects and launches and approvals and so forth, they're all happening

And the Alinity products probably most miraculously five of those began their launch process in Europe and they'll start in the US next year, that's been a huge, huge undertaking, we're extremely excited about Libre, we're excited about all the medical device products, everything that St

Jude represented to Abbott about its pipeline has come to fruition and is coming to fruition and so, we're very, very bullish about all that

And I think we're - and I think there is an awful lot of validation in this about that acquisition

We don't know as much about Alere yet, but we will

And whether it's a big impact for 2018 or if it's beyond 2018, either way I think we're pretty happy to have that business

So you know Rick, I think your assessment is right

It'd be kind of hard for me to say, no it's going to be a tough year

Okay, well first I'd tell you that, this got great leadership and attention from our CFO and our EVP's and SVP's from day one and I'm going to let him answer that question because they've exceeded all of our targets not just by a little, but a lot

The cash flow is strong and I'll let him tell you that

I think [indiscernible] commercial out there

This all gets even better if there is tax reforms

I wouldn't put odds on any more than anybody else watching our government but we're extremely hopeful of the territorial system that and it gives us access to our cash flows and earnings around the world at a reasonable rate and at a competitive rate and that does make it difference to us, in addressing current debt and cash flow, but cash flow itself, super good

I would comment a couple of things

First of all, it was a strange quarter for us in that, multiple hurricanes whether in the Texas Gulf Coast or across the Puerto Rico impacted, anybody who had operations there

The earthquake in Mexico impacted us

The brush fires and forced fires in California actually impacted us the day after we closed Alere had a key Alere facility there

And to be honest, it was more impact on our employees than on our plant operations

We had a little bit of roof damage and a little water leakage here and there, but it would appear the hurricane effected different companies, different ways going across Puerto Rico because I've noted that some competitors have indicated more damage or more impact than we've experienced

It took up a super human effort by a lot of our people to try to address some of that, which we did

The biggest issue was access to power generation in Puerto Rico and our folks address that really rapidly and we're very happy about that

Our plants, I guess back up and running, is the right way to say it

There is one that we're starting this week and we're back up, is what it amounts to

And so there is - I would call it a modest impact, it affected us, I'd say in a modest level, not a material level

Our first priority was to find all of our people and aid them, which we've done

And so in Puerto Rico, we have not experienced the kind of disruption that some others have

I noted that, another large healthcare company yesterday I think had similar comments that they've been able to address it

We're kind of large in Puerto Rico, so it could have been worse, but it wasn't and the St

Jude facilities that we inherited there with the acquisition

Jude were not particularly impacted, I mean they were but not to the degree we might have expected I mean everything is been more about power generation than damage

And unfortunately that's not true for our employees and it's not true for some other competitors and I wouldn't wish that on anybody

But we've been pretty fortunate to get everything back up and running

So we don't have an impact to report for the fourth quarter that we haven't somehow managed or absorbed already in our estimates

The facility that was threatened in California was not damaged

We were able to move things out of that facility and prepare for damage, but there wasn't damage and so we'll be back up and running soon, we did have employees who unfortunately lost homes and so forth and we're dealing with that as a company

But from the standpoint of the operation of the business, we are in good shape relatively speaking and to the extent that there is any impact, we've already included in our estimates for this quarter and absorbed it

Okay, I'm going to have Scott answer that one for you

It's gratifying that our experience with the pacemaker has matched our experience in Japan and Europe with the MRI approvals in terms of share recovery and so forth

So I think that bodes well for the ICD as well

Well let me answer it, this way

I don't really want the organization focused on M&A right now

I think I would give you that answer regardless of what Brian said about debt and cash flow and so forth

And secondly, I wouldn't forecast it even if I had it in my gun sights

Most of the - my experience with you guys over the past 19 years has been you liked to have some indication on what's coming, usually that surprised you more acquisitions or other things that we've done that hasn't always been particularly well received but they've always turned out pretty well, but I generally don't like the forecast where we're going or what we're doing until we announce it and so I probably wouldn't tell you anyway

Glen Novarro But is there some powder [ph] for next year or is next year really let's focus on St

Jude, let's focus on Alere, before we think about anything else

Honestly I think there is focus on St

Jude and Alere and right now that is paying off

Look the focus on St

Jude it's clearly paying off, the focus on Alere will pay off

The focus on the internal product launches of Alinity and so forth, these things will pay off

These are fundamental drivers of sustained growth

I mean it's the hallmark and the identity of the company is sustained growth and we target double-digit earnings growth every single year, your organic performance both in terms of R&D, pipeline, commercial performance etc

has to be sustainable that is where the focus is, and we've acquired a couple of businesses that initially were criticized that's not growth and I beg to differ and I think that we're demonstrating so far with St

Jude that there is a terrific pipeline and growth and share gain, etc

and I think you can see that

You can see that in the initial couple of quarters here, so yes I think there is going to be a lot of focus on not just St

Jude and Alere, but the fundamental organic performance of all of our businesses

You know it took a while for analysts and investors to appreciate the uniqueness of our strategy in established pharma and I think it sort of called out that there is a segment of pharma that's not commodity generic, that's branded generic, that's higher margin, higher growth, etc

in pretty key markets around the world and right now that's our fastest growing business other than neuromod

And neuromod's hard to touch, but we're growing that business at double digits

The team is doing a terrific job

Those markets represent the kind of opportunity we said they did and those kinds of growths from an operating standpoint growth rates out of the business that's what you want

So to some point if we can add to our footprint and add to our strategies, we want to be in a flexible position to do that

We obviously want to get to a position where we have the strategic flexibility that we always felt we had, so I don't think it's a bad idea for us to focus on the operations

Keep pushing our cash flow, keep pushing that debt down

So that's where the focus will be next year and I think we get ourselves back to strategic flexibility quicker that way, which is a good thing

Glen Novarro Yes

Okay and then just I agree with everything you said, just some housekeeping

Maybe for Scott

You said Portico you finished in ruling next to US trial, would that put you on pace for 2019 US launch

And then I think you talked about Mitro [ph] which is the Tendyne program and I think you said you started enrolling, is that enrolling in the European trial and then is there an update on the start of the US trial?
Thanks

I'm going let Scott answer that

It's a really good to know, that's one that came out of our own venture group from our own investments and so forth and we've been able to combine these things, with St

Jude in a way I think is pretty synergistic, pretty favorable so we're pretty excited about that one

Glen Novarro Any update on when you start the US trial for Tendyne?

I mean I think anybody that claimed 50% growth rate was sustainable will be an idiot, but so I'm not going to be one

Look we're very pleased with the performance in Neuromod

I think it's obviously driven by the fact, we've got three great products there

They're being exceptionally well received by the market

They have an impact in real life on patients in their P&L levels

We're seeing great with real world results from Burst and DRG

I think it's a really great group of products and a strong organization

I think the products hit a segment that's in kind need of improvements for patients and particularly the time when pain drugs and so forth are a national issue

So I don't know, I think the new products are driving the growth and the execution is been strong, the uptick is been strong

We've got three quarters in a row, 50% better growth

How long will it be like that? [
Indiscernible] lap it, with all big numbers we'll start to diminish the growth rate, but the actual raw growth will still be pretty strong, so I don't know, I like what we see but it's hard for me to hold it up with an example to all the other business, so you should do this
