Mark?,Neutral
"Sterling, Iâ€™ll take that question",Neutral
"And especially in EMEA, we had a good quarter",Neutral
"I would say, Acrobat, had strong unit quarter thatâ€™s reflected both in Creative Cloud, as well as in Document Cloud",Positive
"So, that continues to be strong as well",Neutral
Youâ€™re absolutely right,Neutral
"And clearly from our point of view, the engagement that they do with their customers or how they deliver their experience continues to be we think one of the key ways in which people make digital tailwind rather than a headwind",Neutral
And we're part of all of those conversations,Neutral

"We continued to see growth, both in terms of the demand, as well as in terms of the inventory",Positive
"Sign had a good quarter, all of them are adding",Neutral

"So, weâ€™re seeing that whether it's in financial services, whether we are seeing retail, travel hospitality, automotive, itâ€™s a key part of our differentiator and one that we will continue to innovate in",Positive
So weâ€™re hoping a lot of will be at Summit,Neutral
I think youâ€™ll be pleased with how quickly weâ€™ve been able to integrate the products,Positive
And I think the team has done a great job,Positive
This is a $40 billion TAM,Neutral
But our track record and our winning percentage record in the areas that weâ€™re strong continues to be excellent,Positive
I think we have a differentiated solution,Neutral
"The way I would answer that is strategically as we look at that business, there're three things that we think we continue have to execute on to ensure that we capitalize on the opportunity that we've talked about; the first is integration within the products",Positive
I think you've seen us make some good integration with products like PhotoShop,Positive
So the ability for people to contribute and to acquire assets is built into the product,Neutral
"Now, I think in all three of those, weâ€™re continuing to make great progress",Positive
"So, we feel good about it Derrick",Neutral
Youâ€™re absolutely right,Neutral
"The good news is weâ€™re absolutely mission-critical to our customers, so the level engagement that we have with these enterprises is at multiple levels, all the way from the C-Suite to all the practitioners who are using our products",Positive
"Because itâ€™s not just what you do internally, it's ensuring that the thousand partners that I talked about who are also partners to the companies that weâ€™re working with are evangelizing and are promoting our products, and are educated on our projects",Neutral
So I actually feel good about all of those,Neutral
And so we have done some when they make sense,Neutral
"And to your point, in CC when we think about the CC enterprise opportunity and the conversation that we are having with those customers, weâ€™re very much moving them from custom to complete and we are moving them from complete to complete plus services",Neutral
And the service that is top of mind for as Stock,Neutral
"And since that was the last question, I think in summary, we were really pleased with the strong start to Q1. It was an outstanding quarter, and I think the Q2 targets that we gave reflect the continued momentum in the business",Positive
"But in addition to the great quarterly performance, weâ€™re really excited about the long-term opportunities that weâ€™ve outlined, namely the ability to empower people to create the things they want to create and to enable businesses to transform themselves",Positive

"We really hope you'll join us to hear about our vision for the future, and demonstrate both product and partner progress against that vision",Neutral
But thank you for joining us today,Neutral
First quarter revenue increased 18% from a year ago to $984 million based on growth across both of our business segments,Neutral
Gross margin also improved driven largely by the success of our recently launched Ryzen CPUs,Neutral
"I am pleased with our first quarter product execution and improved year-over-year financial results, which demonstrate the revenue growth and gross margin expansion potential with our strong set of new products",Positive
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment,Neutral
We delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth,Neutral
Strong demand for Ryzen CPUs and improved GPU sales resulted in CG revenue increasing 29% from the year ago period,Positive
"CG revenue declined 1% sequentially, which was better than normal seasonality, as significant growth in desktop processor sales driven by the first month of Ryzen CPU sales largely offset seasonal declines in GPU and notebook APU sales",Negative
"Solid demand for our family of premium Ryzen 7 processors, including our flagship Ryzen 7 1800X offering, which is the industry's highest performance 8-core CPU drove our highest desktop processor revenue in more than two years",Neutral
"Ryzen CPUs have been consistently ranked among the top-selling processors at global etailers and retailers, and press reviews and end-user sentiments have highlighted the strong performance and value proposition",Positive
"In Graphics, GPU sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago based on growth across all of our product lines",Positive
"The ramp of Polaris-based notebook design wins drove increased mobile GPU sales, while our desktop growth was led by improved channel sales",Neutral
"We also saw higher professional graphics revenue from a year ago, driven by expanding channel sales and growing data center wins as we continue to increase our GPU compute footprint with leading cloud service providers",Positive
We remain on track to launch the first products from our next-generation Radeon Vega family later this quarter,Neutral
"Customer excitement is building as we focus on bringing significant competition to the high-end GPU space across the PC gaming, professional design and GPU compute markets",Neutral
revenue increased 5% from a year ago driven by the latest game console offerings from Sony and Microsoft and our third straight quarter delivering year-on-year embedded revenue growth,Neutral
"We have now seated thousands of Naples processors across an extensive set of OEMs, end users and partners, and remain on track for our first Naples products to launch this quarter",Neutral
"In closing, we started 2017 delivering significant year-on-year revenue growth and margin expansion based on solid product execution and strong market and customer reception to our new leadership products",Positive
Naples is the first step in our long-term plan to deliver a leadership data center product roadmap; complementing the success of our mainstream Polaris-based GPUs with our high-end Vega GPUs; extending our Zen core into the mainstream desktop and premium notebook markets with the launches of our Ryzen 3 CPUs and Ryzen mobile APUs in the second half of the year; and expanding our participation in the fast-growing market for GPU compute with the launch of Radeon Instinct Accelerators mid-year,Neutral
"2017 is an important year for AMD, and we are well-positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion based on bringing performance, choice and innovation to an expanding set of markets",Positive
It was a big launch for us,Neutral
All of the feedback that we've gotten so far from both our customers and from end users has been very strong,Positive
"I think the value proposition is very strong at both the Ryzen 7 eight-core devices, as well as the Ryzen 5 four and six-core devices",Positive
So nothing out of the ordinary there,Neutral
So we feel really good about where it is,Neutral
"I think the important thing is as we go into the second quarter, we not only have the channel sales, but we also have the major OEMs that will be launching their systems in the second quarter",Neutral
"But overall, I would say it went quite well",Neutral
"Absolutely, Matt",Neutral
"So if you look at our gross margin progression given the mix of our business, clearly, we made actually very nice progress year over year",Positive
"So if you look at Q1 2017 compared to Q1 2016, we expanded margin by 2 points, and that was really on the strength of Ryzen",Positive
"When you look sequentially, because of the mix of our business, game consoles were at the lowest point in the first quarter",Negative
So the relative mix of the business sees more gaming consoles in the second quarter relative to the first quarter,Positive
So that's the reason for the sequential guidance,Neutral
"But again, if you look year over year, Q2 2017 to Q2 2016, you'll see again a nice margin expansion as a result of the strength of the products",Positive
"Thanks, Matt",Neutral
"Sure, Ross",Neutral
We are early in the ramp,Neutral
"So on your first question, relative to the margins and how those look, I think they are â€“ the yields are as expected",Neutral
"And so, in terms of the new product ramp, the yields are as expected and per our margin structure",Neutral
"And, Mark, maybe just to finish off the comment, I think, to your question, I think, we feel pretty good about our cost structure",Neutral
We're always going to continue to try to reduce the cost structure over time,Positive
"But in terms of the margin expansion story, as we go through the year, it's going to be about the mix of business",Neutral
"And as we get into the higher ASP, stronger product portfolio and that ramps to a larger piece of the business, that will be the margin expansion story",Positive
"Thanks, Mark",Neutral
"Absolutely, David",Neutral
So Vega is really a new architecture,Neutral
"We expect Vega to be a broad product for us that will go across the gaming segment, the professional workstation segment, as well as GPUs in the data center",Neutral
And we will be launching products across all of those segments with the Vega architecture in the next couple of months,Neutral
I think certainly the Ryzen gross margins are substantially better than the legacy portfolio,Neutral
So I think that is true,Neutral
"I think when you look at the sequential â€“ there was 1% sequential decline, and there was a $7 million or $8 million sequential improvement in operating loss",Neutral
There was also some additional R&D in that segment as we're ramping up both product expenses as well as some sales and marketing and go-to-market expenses in the quarter,Neutral
"So overall, it was as we expected",Neutral
"Maybe, Devinder, do you want to add to that?",Neutral
"Stacy, maybe I just want to clarify because I want to make sure that we were clear",Neutral
"So the masks were in OpEx and now they're going to be capitalized as they go into production, so they weren't in COGS before",Neutral
"But overall, I think what we're trying to do is basically as the mask sets become more sizable on the production level to capitalize them",Neutral
"Thanks, Stacy",Neutral
"So, Ambrish, I think you should expect that we will expand margins as we go through the year",Neutral
We do have this mix effect between Semi-Custom and new product revenue,Neutral
"But certainly, our exit velocity, as we exit the year, we should see â€“ when you compare year-on-year sort of Q4 2017 to Q4 2016, you should see the margin expansion",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"So the full year guide is low double-digit revenue growth, 2017 to 2016. I think, given our product portfolio being very much influenced by the PC â€“ the Ryzen and PCs, Vega for GPUs as well as Naples from a server standpoint, we expect that the Computing and Graphics segment will be â€“ will grow more so than the EESC segment overall on a year-over-year basis, just given some of the consumer markets move faster than some of the data center and server markets",Neutral
"Overall, from a performance standpoint, the product and the customer engagements is going as we would expect",Neutral
We will launch here in the second quarter,Neutral
So we'll start some low volume of revenue shipments during the second quarter that will ramp gradually into the second half of the year,Neutral
I think I have said before and I would still say that the server market has a longer design win to revenue conversion cycle,Neutral
And so we would expect it to take a couple of quarters for us to ramp the Naples product over time,Neutral
We have more memory bandwidth,Neutral
We have more I/O than our competition,Neutral
"But, certainly, we feel that it's, again, like Ryzen, on the strength of the Zen core, we have a very, very strong foundational product",Positive
"Yes, John",Neutral
"Just quickly, Lisa, given that mix now is becoming quite important in trying to understand gross margin, I'd be kind of curious, what percent of your Compute business in the March quarter was based on Ryzen? And I guess, if you assume that all of the transitions to Ryzen eventually â€“ had that occurred in the March quarter, can you give us an understanding of how much better gross margins would have been? And then I have a follow-up",Neutral
"We take revenue on a sell-out model and so you should think about â€“ although, we shipped a number of Ryzens, we didn't necessarily revenue them all in the quarter just given that we're on a sellout model for our revenue recognition",Neutral
We're going to â€“ Ryzen 5 has started,Neutral
So it will take us through this year to really transition the majority of the product over to Ryzen,Neutral
"And so, we're pleased with sort of the pricing that we're commanding for the product and the reception for the product",Positive
"But to the extent that your old gross margin target was sort of 36% to 40%, I'm just kind of curious",Neutral
"To what extent can you get to that 38% midpoint just by moving your current market share mix towards Ryzen? And to what extent does getting to 38% or above imply either market share gains in the Compute business on the desktop, notebook side or on the server side? How do I think about that dynamic?",Neutral
"So I think the idea on the PC side is, again, I think 2017, a large percentage of the margin story is around PCs",Neutral
"But to the fundamental question, I think we feel good that the mix dynamics are there, the product is strong enough to command the right ASPs that we can get to the long-term margin targets several different ways",Positive
"Thanks, John",Neutral
"I think we will be continuing to ramp Zen-based product in the PC business throughout the year, as we bring more and more SKUs online",Neutral
"So, as we get into back-to-school, the retail segments and holiday, you would expect that both channel and OEM PC sales to benefit from the stronger product portfolio",Positive
We normally see the seasonality going from Q4 to Q1 that sales go down,Neutral
We saw something very normal to that,Neutral
So we see the gaming segment as healthy,Neutral
Graphics continues to be a strong segment,Neutral
Maybe let me start on the OpEx and then have Devinder comment on the second piece of the question,Neutral
"So on the OpEx, we are making targeted investments in several different areas",Neutral
"So from our standpoint, these are very strong products",Positive
We want to make sure that we have enough customer resources to help our customers ramp into production,Neutral
"So I think they're targeted investments, but as we've been in the past, we'll be very prudent with where the OpEx goes",Neutral
And then relative to the,Neutral
"So, Joe, the way to think about that is for the Ryzen 7 and a good portion of the Ryzen 5, we really didn't have a competing product in that segment, so it's really additive",Neutral
The legacy products will continue in the market,Positive
So we feel that they're very complementary products and different geographies moves at different rates,Neutral
"We have still a significant installed base of motherboards out there from our previous generation, so we'll keep supporting both products",Neutral
So we're very pleased with where the Ryzen product is positioned now,Positive
"We think, from a value proposition standpoint, performance, performance per dollar, it's very strong",Positive
We obviously have other products we're going to be launching throughout the year to ensure that we have strong product positioning throughout the year,Positive
"And I think the more important thing, Joe, and we'll talk more about this at our Financial Analyst Day is we have a long-term roadmap, whether you're talking about PCs or GPUs or servers to ensure that we continue to refresh our product plans and our product roadmaps over time",Positive
"So I think we feel good about where we are positioned today, and we're going to ensure that we continue to roll out products to strengthen that positioning over time",Positive
"Yes, Chris",Neutral
So there was no particular supply constraint,Neutral
"When you think about the channel market or the DIY market, you can basically introduce your product any time during the year",Neutral
The OEMs have a very set cycle,Neutral
They typically launch new products in Q2 for the back-to-school season,Neutral
"I think we're pleased with where the overall launch is, and we'll be rolling out many more products over the coming quarters",Positive
Q2 was a strong quarter for us as we continued to ramp our high-performance product portfolio,Positive
"Second quarter revenue increased 19% to $1.22 billion, and gross margin improved year-over-year",Neutral
"Importantly, we returned to non-GAAP net income profitability in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our Computing and Graphics segment",Positive
"Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we made excellent progress in the quarter and reported operating profitability for the first time in three years based on our leadership Ryzen processor and GPU product offerings",Neutral
"The expansion and growing adoption of our Ryzen CPUs, combined with our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year Graphics revenue growth, resulted in a 51% increase in Computing and Graphics segment sales year-over-year",Neutral
"Client computing revenue increased by strong double-digit percentage from a year ago, driven by a significant ramp and strong sell-through of our Ryzen CPUs in the first full quarter of sales",Positive
Our Ryzen family of processors drove a richer mix of shipments and client ASPs improved significantly from a year ago,Neutral
"As we move into the second half of 2017, we are on track to complete the full family of Ryzen processors, including Ryzen 3 processors targeting the mainstream and value market segments with on-Shop availability later this week; Ryzen Threadripper products for the high-end desktop markets with global component channel availability in early August; Ryzen PRO-based offerings targeting the commercial client segments with availability in Q3; and Ryzen Mobile APUs, which will be available for the consumer market later this year",Positive
"In Graphics, GPU revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage from year ago, with higher unit shipments and ASPs driving growth across our desktop and mobile GPU products",Positive
"Demand for Radeon RX GPUs was strong in the quarter, driven by gaming and cryptocurrency mining",Positive
"Apple announced that our Radeon Pro Vega product will power the new iMac Pro, a workstation-class product line designed for creators running the most demanding workflows",Neutral
"We will launch additional Radeon Vega products at SIGGRAPH next week, expanding further in the premium portions of the consumer and professional GPU markets",Neutral
Our investments in GPU compute and Radeon Instinct are continuing to build momentum,Neutral
We introduced our first Vega-based Radeon Instinct datacenter products in June,Neutral
"Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue declined 5% year-over-year and increased 44% sequentially",Negative
The sequential revenue gains were primarily based on higher Semi-Custom product shipments due to seasonality,Neutral
"In addition, we reached an important milestone in the quarter, delivering initial EPYC server revenue",Neutral
"In our semi-custom business, unit shipments were up sequentially and down year-over-year as we enter the fifth year of the current game console sales cycle",Neutral
"As we look at the remainder of the year and given the maturity of the current game console cycle, we expect semi-custom revenue to be down for the full year",Neutral
"And we expect an additional 20 EPYC platforms to be available in the second half of 2017. With the strong global ecosystem and customer interest we have built around our EPYC processor family, we are on track to reenter the datacenter market in a major way",Positive
"In closing, we are very pleased with the trend of our quarterly results and how our products are positioned heading into the back half of the year",Positive
"Our business foundation and growth opportunities are strong, based on our high-performance product portfolio and our expanding customer traction",Positive
"Given our first half 2017 performance and our visibility into the third quarter, we are happy to report we are progressing ahead of our annual revenue guidance and we look forward to a strong year overall",Positive
Devinder?,Neutral
Thanks for your questions,Neutral
So we are very pleased with the reception to EPYC,Neutral
The general reception has been very positive,Neutral
I would say that interest level is very high,Neutral
"In terms of what to expect in the revenue ramp, we started shipping early volume in the second half of June",Neutral
We would expect that we continue to ramp that revenue through the second half of the year,Positive
But so far so good,Neutral
"Sure, Mark",Neutral
So certainly the overall quarter for Graphics was strong,Positive
So it was better than seasonal,Neutral
"But it's important to say we didn't have cryptocurrency in our forecast, and we're not looking at it as a long-term growth driver",Neutral
"Thanks, Mark",Neutral
"Sure, Matt",Neutral
"And the important thing, particularly in the enterprise market, as well as the commercial market, having a road map â€“ a strong road map with multiple generations is important",Positive
We're working with multiple foundries on that,Neutral
"We have multiple design teams that are working, and we expect that that will give us a strong competitive road map for the next several generations",Positive
"No, I think you covered it, Devinder",Neutral
"On the investment front, Matt, just to give you a little bit more color on that, I think we see tremendous opportunity in the datacenter around both CPU and GPU compute",Neutral
And so we're taking the opportunity with some of the strength in the business to make sure we lean in to those resources and fully pay off the product investments,Neutral
"Good question, Ross",Neutral
So Ryzen performed very well,Neutral
I think the ASP contribution is very evident on the desktop line item,Neutral
"The OEMs launch their desktop products in about mid-June, and so they just started selling at the end of June",Neutral
And the mobile products are still our legacy products,Neutral
"So you saw the mobile ASPs were down slightly as we went from Q1 to Q2, and that was just a mix on some of the legacy business",Neutral
But the desktop ASPs were quite strong,Neutral
So I think you summarized the revenue guidance well,Neutral
I think we see the Computing and Graphics business accelerating on the strength of the new products,Neutral
"When you look at our Q3 margin guidance, we are certainly up year-over-year 3 points, and so I think that's the strength of the product portfolio",Neutral
"I think as we get into the Q4 guidance, we'll talk more about the margin progression",Neutral
"But what we expected in terms of margin expansion with the premium products is certainly playing out, and that's helping the Q3 guide",Neutral
"Yes, David",Neutral
Yes,Neutral
"So Ryzen notebook is on track to launch for the holiday platform sales, and so you should see OEMs launching Ryzen Mobile for the holiday period",Neutral
"So yes, we will see revenue in the second half of the year",Neutral
"Thanks, David",Neutral
"Sure, Ambrish",Neutral
"So I think from an overall standpoint, we see strong demand in graphics for the third quarter",Positive
I think that's a mix of a couple things,Neutral
That's a mix of gaming being seasonally stronger in the third quarter,Positive
That's a mix of inventories being very low in the channel,Neutral
"When we look at it as a whole, though, we think that the growth in the business is really on the strength of the products and how the design wins, both OEM and as well as system integrators are improving",Neutral
"Now, how is it different than sort of a couple of years ago? I think we understand the market much better from the standpoint of the products are significantly stronger",Positive
"And so if you look at the product portfolio, not just the current sort of Polaris or RX 5 Series products, but the Vega product coming in, really opens up a larger TAM for us",Neutral
"But overall, I would view it as GPUs are strong, and we see GPUs continuing to be strong, and so it's a great market to be in",Positive
"I mean, it all starts as a good product or a great product",Positive
And so I think the EPYC product performance is very important,Neutral
So I think our differentiation is strong,Neutral
"I think we have â€“ we put out a product that is not only strong on basic CPU performance, but also offers much more flexibility in terms of what you can do with memory and I/O",Positive
So we certainly are looking to ramp the revenue as fast as possible,Neutral
It's been an exciting market,Neutral
Some would say from a product standpoint there has been a bit of back-and-forth already,Neutral
"We feel good about how our products are positioned not just today, but how they will be positioned over the next 18 to 24 months",Neutral
And so we're going to be very focused on ensuring that we lead with the product message,Neutral
"Of course, there's a go-to-market element and all of that around that, but I think the competitive environment right now is very focused on product competitiveness",Neutral
I believe we've worked around a lot of that,Neutral
I've actually been very happy with how they've jumped on the support of it,Positive
"I think you'll see as we go through Threadripper launch, which is coming up very shortly, that the Ryzen ecosystem is strong",Positive
But we also have a very strong OEM support base as well,Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"I think from a supply standpoint we've had a very strong supply chain across the board, across both CPU and GPUs",Positive
"We are, as I said, in the process of catching up to demand, and so we're certainly increasing some of the production, and that was Devinder's comment about some of the working capital and some of the inventory comments",Neutral
"Overall, though, I think we're going into a stronger second half of the year",Positive
So it's not unexpected for us to ramp up production,Neutral
"It's just demand was quite strong, particularly in the April, May timeframe is when we saw a spike, and it takes some time to react to those signals",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"So, so far so good",Neutral
"I think the customer feedback continues to be very strong, and our goal is to get as many platforms out as possible with EPYC this year",Positive
"So yes, John",Neutral
Let me answer that,Neutral
We'll see what happens,Neutral
And so we like the growth very much,Positive
And then relative to the profit statement,Neutral
"Now, relative to priorities in R&D, it is very much focused on sort of the new growth areas for us, very much focused on datacenter and very much focused on GPU compute, so around machine learning and sort of the entire compute space on the GPU side",Neutral
So I think it's good,Neutral
"We're happy that the business affords us the ability to increase R&D in this timeframe, and we're using it to accelerate our growth in these high-margin markets",Positive
John W,Neutral
"So, Vijay, without getting too granular about percentage of EPYC revenue, I think what we've said is our target for EPYC, we sort of have -- the midterm target is to get back to double-digit market share, so over 10%",Neutral
We think that we have a product and a customer set in an environment that does support that,Neutral
"It will take longer than this year to get there, so I think this is the multiple-quarter ramp for us, but in terms of how we've laid out the business model, I mean, that's all contemplated sort of in our overall growth model for 2017. As it relates to margins, again, without being very specific, I would say the EPYC margins are highly accretive, even at our current sort of pricing, which offers, I would say, significant value to the customer",Neutral
I think it also gives us significant credit for the capability of the product,Neutral
And so the margins are accretive to our business model,Neutral
"Yes, yes",Neutral
A number of different applications,Neutral
We see that interest continue to ramp,Neutral
And that's the way it would work,Neutral
"But again, very good market",Neutral
I think we're in the very early part of the growth trajectory for AMD in these markets,Neutral
"Thank you very much, Operator",Neutral
We appreciate everyone being with us today,Neutral
"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone",Neutral
"I am pleased with our performance for the third quarter of 2017. We increased revenue 26% year-over-year, expanded gross margin and achieved both operating and net income with net income of $110 million and diluted earnings of $0.10 per share",Positive
"We are executing well with our strongest portfolio of products in many years including our Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon Vega offerings",Positive
revenue of $1.64 billion grew 26% year-over-year and 34% sequentially,Positive
"This is our highest quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2011. Year-over-year growth was primarily due to our Computing and Graphics segment, while sequential growth was driven by the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue seasonality, as well as higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue",Neutral
"Gross margin was 35%, up 4 percentage points year-over-year, primarily driven by the benefit of IP-related revenue and a richer mix from the Computing and Graphics segment, which were partially offset by costs associated with our global foundries wafer supply agreement for wafers purchased at another foundry",Neutral
"We continue to make good progress on the ramp of our new high-performance products, which had a positive impact on our gross margins",Positive
Operating expenses of $419 million compared to $353 million a year ago,Neutral
"The increase was primarily due to higher R&D-related investments and expenses related to annual employee incentive programs, driven by our better financial performance",Neutral
"Third quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $45 million, up slightly from $43 million a year ago",Neutral
Lower interest expense from a year ago was largely offset by withholding taxes for licensing revenue,Neutral
"Net income was $110 million or diluted earnings of $0.10 per share as compared to $27 million, or $0.03 per share a year ago",Neutral
"The diluted earnings per share calculation for the third quarter of 2017 was based on 1.143 million shares, which includes 100.6 million shares related to our 2026 convertible notes",Neutral
Adjusted EBITDA was $191 million compared to $103 million a year ago,Neutral
Now turning to the business segments,Neutral
"Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $890 million, up 74% year-over-year, primarily due to strong sales of our Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors",Positive
Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $70 million compared to a loss of $66 million a year ago,Neutral
The solid improvement was primarily due to higher revenue,Neutral
"Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $824 million, approximately flat year-over-year due to lower semi-custom SoC sales, partially offset by IP-related revenue",Neutral
"Additionally, server revenue increased from a year ago, driven by the increased sales of EPYC products",Neutral
"As you heard earlier from Lisa, customer interest and deployment plans are strong",Positive
"Operating income was $84 million, down $52 million from $136 million a year ago, primarily due to higher costs",Neutral
Turning to the balance sheet,Neutral
"Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total $879 million at the end of the quarter, up from $844 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue",Neutral
Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.36 billion,Neutral
"Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.74 billion",Neutral
"In the third quarter, we used $28 million from our lower interest secured revolving line of credit to pay down long-term debt, which has a higher interest rate",Neutral
"For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect revenue to decrease approximately 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%",Neutral
"At the midpoint, this equates to revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year",Neutral
"Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 35%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $410 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes, and other to be approximately $30 million, and inventory to be down sequentially",Neutral
We now expect 2017 annual revenue to increase by greater than 20% over 2016 compared to the prior guidance of mid to high-teens percentage growth,Neutral
"In closing, the third quarter was a strong quarter and we are pleased with the momentum of our new premium products",Positive
"We are making solid progress towards our growth and margin expansion objectives; and as our financial performance improves, we remain committed to investing in our multi-generational road maps and achieving our long-term financial targets",Neutral
Laura?,Neutral
"Hi, Mark",Neutral
"If I can just add, if you look at the margin trend compared to 2016, 2016 we had 31% gross margin",Neutral
And we expect to be at 34% this year,Neutral
And that's primarily based on the strength of the new product that Lisa referenced,Neutral
"And from a long-term model standpoint, we are on track with what we laid out in the financial Analyst Day of going from 31% to 34%, and then expecting to be greater than 36% in 2018 on the strength of the new premium products that are ramping into 2018.",Neutral
"I think the way I look at that is if you look at Q3 from a volume standpoint and the volume is pretty high, and that's why it's highlighted from a viewpoint of the calls, but the way you want to look at it going forward Q4 and beyond is all of the costs related with the WSA that's referenced in the scripts is contemplated in our guidance and our long-term models",Neutral
"I think the first thing I'll say is we do want to invest in the business, especially with the growth opportunities we have and primarily targeting the OpEx investments towards R&D",Neutral
"They are, in the current moment, with a lot of products ramping, just in the last few months, you heard about the Ryzen ramp, you heard about EPYC, we talk about Vega, and obviously, their go-to-market cost will ramp up new products",Neutral
"But as far as 2017 guidance is concerned, I had said previously 31% as the potential of revenue, but I think right now, where the numbers are coming out especially with the strength on the revenue side of the equation, we think we end up at about 30% on an expense to revenue ratio in 2017, which, as you probably recall, is at the upper end of what we had said our long-term target model which is 26% to 30%",Neutral
"So actually, I'm pretty pleased because if everything works out in the Q4 guidance that we gave, and in 2016 would have been a 32% of revenue; in 2017, approximately 30%; and then obviously, we'll see where we get into 2018. We're very pleased from a viewpoint of being able to make the investments in the business to support the product road map, the go-to-market cost for the ramp of new products, and at the same time, bring down the percentage of OpEx over revenue",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"I think if you look at it from an overall standpoint, if you look at the cost impact, it's all within our guidance",Neutral
And you see the benefit across both the segments,Neutral
"And from a go-forward standpoint, despite the cost of being there, we look at it overall from a viewpoint of the trend of the margin",Neutral
Major provider of the gross margin uplift is the premium new products that we are launching,Neutral
"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
"As Tom outlined, Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines",Positive
"Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $616 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange movements",Neutral
revenue was up a healthy 15% if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers Tom just mentioned,Neutral
revenue growth continued to be solid across the business with the overachievement versus our guidance driven by a higher-than-expected uptick in holiday season traffic with our Media Solutions and customers,Positive
Media-related traffic was particularly strong in the quarter,Positive
"Before I get into the revenue details, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency",Positive
"revenue from our Media Delivery Solutions was $196 million in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year, but up 8% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers",Neutral
We saw healthy seasonal traffic growth in both our gaming and software download verticals and continued robust growth in video delivery,Positive
"Turning to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $367 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year",Neutral
"Within the Solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines",Neutral
"As Tom mentioned, we have been seeing strong traction with our recently launched Image Manager and Bot Manager solutions, and we have continued to see significant growth and demand for all of our Cloud Security offerings",Positive
"Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $102 million, up 41% year-over-year, capping off another tremendous year of revenue growth and customer adoption of our security solutions globally",Neutral
"Exiting Q4, our Security business now has an annualized revenue run-rate of over $400 million",Neutral
We are very pleased with the growth and execution of our Cloud Security business over the past few years,Positive
"This growth was driven by targeted product innovation and go-to-market resource investments, as well as a very successful acquisition",Neutral
"We plan to maintain this aggressive investment posture to further broaden not only our Cloud Security offerings, but also our Web performance and emerging enterprise solution capabilities where we see substantial long-term growth potential",Neutral
"Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year",Neutral
"Turning now to our Q4 customer division results, revenue from our Web Division customers was $300 million, up 14% year-over-year",Positive
"We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings",Positive
"revenue from our Media Division customers was $301 million in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year and up 15% excluding the impact of the six large Internet Platform Customers",Neutral
This strong growth rate was driven not only by Media Division customers driving more holiday season traffic,Positive
"Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $15 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year",Neutral
"Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q4, consistent with the prior quarter",Neutral
"International revenue was $193 million in the fourth quarter, up 19%, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region",Positive
Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of just under $2 million on a year-over-year basis and a $6 million impact on a sequential basis as the dollar strengthened significantly through the quarter,Neutral
revenue from our U.S,Neutral
"market was $424 million, up 2% year-over-year",Neutral
", revenue growth was a solid 13% across the rest of the business",Neutral
"Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in-line with our guidance",Neutral
"GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, up 2 points from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and a point higher than our guidance due to the strong revenue achievement",Positive
GAAP operating expenses were $289 million in the fourth quarter,Neutral
"These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items",Neutral
"Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $230 million, up $23 million from Q3 levels",Neutral
"This was above the high-end of our guidance, driven by increased year-end commission costs associated with the revenue overachievement, as well as a significant uptick in litigation spend associated with our Limelight patent infringement cases",Positive
"Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $247 million, up $9 million from Q3 levels, and $10 million from the same period last year",Neutral
"Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q3 levels and from Q4 last year, and in line with our guidance",Neutral
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $84 million in the fourth quarter,Neutral
"These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense",Neutral
Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28% consistent with Q3 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance,Neutral
"Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the fourth quarter was about $4 million, consistent with Q3 levels",Neutral
Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million,Neutral
"As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results",Neutral
"Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $92 million or $0.52 of earnings per diluted share",Neutral
"Non-GAAP net income was $126 million or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range driven by higher revenues and a slightly lower tax rate",Neutral
"Adjusting for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in Q4 2015, earnings grew 8% year-over-year",Positive
"For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 27%",Neutral
Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $50 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 28% and coming in about 2 points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings,Neutral
Now I'll review some balance sheet items,Neutral
"Day sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 54 days, down 2 days from Q3 levels",Neutral
"Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $78 million and slightly below our guidance for the quarter primarily due to the timing of network buildouts that moved into Q1. For the full year 2016, capital expenditures came in at 14% of revenue and below our long-term model as we grew into our existing capacity from the significant 2015 buildouts",Positive
Cash flow generation continue to be strong in Q4. Free cash flow was $106 million in the fourth quarter and $550 million for the year or 24% of revenue,Positive
"Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter",Positive
"If you'll factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $1 billion",Neutral
"In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company",Positive
"Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see a normal sequential revenue decline for seasonality, perhaps a bit more pronounced in the recent years due to the particularly strong media performance this past quarter",Positive
dollar over the past few months,Neutral
"At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of just under $4 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year",Neutral
"Factoring in both of these variables, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $596 million to $610 million",Neutral
"At the higher end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% constant currency, a slight acceleration from Q4 levels",Neutral
"At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%",Neutral
"Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $217 million to $222 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels primarily due to less commission spend and fewer customer events",Neutral
"Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 39% to 40%",Neutral
"And as mentioned earlier, we plan to significantly increase our investment levels in 2017 in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling â€“ important areas we believe will help us enable to drive accelerated, sustainable long-term growth and scale",Neutral
"And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond Q1 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to grow investments throughout 2017 at a faster pace than revenue growth",Neutral
Our goal is to re-accelerate the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the longer-term,Neutral
"We are confident the success we have had with our Cloud Security investment strategy can be duplicated in other areas of the business, most notably in our new and emerging Enterprise Solutions portfolio",Neutral
This deliberate investment strategy will result in EBITDA margins in the high 30s in 2017 and for the foreseeable future,Neutral
"Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $74 million and $76 million",Neutral
"Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% to 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.69. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $48 million to $51 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of just under 29.5%",Neutral
"On CapEx, we expect a significant uptick from recent spending levels in both the first quarter and throughout 2017. This increase is driven partly by some platform deployments that shifted from Q1, but mostly by our desire to continue expanding our secure delivery network and increasing capacity to support our rapidly growing Security business",Positive
It's also worth noting that our planned investment increases in product innovation and scaling our platform will impact CapEx as well as OpEx as we capitalize more R&D development,Neutral
"As such, we expect CapEx spending to return to our long-term model range of 16% to 18% of revenue in 2017. And with the increasing CapEx, you will also see an uptick in depreciation levels throughout 2017. In closing, Akamai accomplished a great deal in 2016, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term",Positive
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"Yeah, I'll take that",Neutral
"But as you can imagine with new products, it's going to take a fair amount of time to actually fully penetrate them at installed base",Neutral
"But as Tom said, for both of these products, Bot Manager launched earlier in the year, Image Manager launched mid-year",Neutral
"Bot Manager in particular, this is the fastest-growing product we've had in a long, long time, and so the penetration is still early days",Neutral
"But it was a reasonably meaningful contributor to growth in Q4, in particular, our Performance and Security portfolio",Neutral
"So I think these new product offerings are kind of again proof points to Tom's comments that innovation is alive and well, and there's more to sell to the installed base to accelerate growth of the company",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"We're in a position to defend and absorb the largest attacks out there, and we've got a great track record and there's a lot of other folks that offer scrubbing services or DDoS services of one kind or another, and they've all pretty much had high profile failures",Positive
"AWS, we don't see really much in the marketplace",Neutral
"And DDoS is relevant for most of our customer base, so there's a lot of cross-selling that takes place and the Security Services, in general, were leading with a sale there and a lot of new accounts where they will join with Akamai because either our DDoS solution or our application layer protection capabilities with Kona and that brings new customers to Akamai",Neutral
"As we talked about, they're now collectively less than 10% of our revenue so the future impact is obviously limited, and we expect to see some further decline, but nothing to scale that we've seen over the last one to two years",Negative
"Not at all, not at all, that our balance sheet has a lot of firepower to do M&A, to do CapEx purchases and to do our share buyback",Neutral
"But we have ample firepower to do full CapEx purchases, share buyback and M&A",Neutral
We're certainly going to see a step-up in head count investments,Neutral
"You're right that we have a little bit more head count ramp here in the fourth quarter, but we hired for the year about a little over 400 people, I think, including some acquisitions",Neutral
"I think what you're going to see is that this step-up in investment is that our head count ramp is probably going to be more similar to what it's been historically than it was this past year, and as I mentioned it's going to be targeted but very heavily focused in new product innovation",Neutral
"There's also investment we're going to need to be making in our service delivery enablement that I mentioned, that our Services business is growing quite rapidly",Neutral
And we're going to be making investments in continuing to scale the platform,Neutral
And then just kind of a quick follow-up,Neutral
"Jim, you did say just in terms of looking at the Q1, we can expect a bigger sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 on a revenue basis than typically we've seen, and just wanted to understand how much of that is being driven by, like you said, the outperformance on the Media side? And how much of that is a continued expectation of â€“ and I know it's not as significant as before but just the continued declines of revenue from the top six Internet Platform Customers?",Negative
"Well, yeah, I mean, as Tom mentioned that we probably will see continued decline in the Internet Platform Customers in the first quarter; one, because seasonally they declined Q4 to Q1 anyways, because they also have a seasonally stronger Q4. But I'd say the bigger component of it is not that, and it's more that we had a very strong Q4 for Media",Positive
"Media traffic was kind of seasonally very, very strong",Positive
Unknown Speaker Got it,Neutral
"I think it's also fair to comment that even outside of Media that I think the company is certainly much more diversified now than it was kind of even a year ago or two years ago, that our performance in Security business now represents 60% of the company's revenue, you include kind of services, call it 70-plus percent of the revenue",Neutral
"So Media is becoming a much smaller percentage of the company's revenue, and we know that the Media business can have variability just given the nature of the business",Neutral
So I think what you're going to see going forward is that you're going to see more stability in the company's growth rates,Neutral
"I do think that there is an opportunity for Media to reaccelerate growth rates, but I think the catalyst for that is really going to be a significant uptick in Over the Top viewing",Neutral
And I think we're seeing steady growth in that area right now,Neutral
"Yeah, I'll parse that",Neutral
"So, certainly on the OTT side that, yeah, we're seeing very steady growth in OTT",Neutral
"It's been that way for some time, but it's steady growth, so it's much more consistent growth in Over The Top than say gaming or software downloads, which tend to be much more variable based on games that get released or software updates that occur",Neutral
And I'd say that has been the bigger catalyst driving growth in the Media business that those â€“ the gaming and the software download area tends to be much more spiky,Neutral
So I think the catalyst for growth in the Media business is going to be OTT,Neutral
I don't think you're going to see the catalyst,Neutral
"And on your CapEx question, I'm glad you asked, because we certainly are not trying to signal that we're doing a build-out for some anticipation of further OTT",Neutral
It's rapidly growing,Neutral
So it's really for other parts of the business,Neutral
It's not so much for the Media business,Neutral
"Thanks for the question, Colby",Neutral
"I do think that what you're going to see in 2017, and I said for the foreseeable future, because I think you're going to hear in 2017, you're going to hear about new product adjacencies that we are going to enter",Neutral
And I think what you're going to see is we're going to make investments in those areas,Neutral
"Those investments are probably going to extend beyond 2017. And so I think the interim model for the company, not the long-term model, I think, the interim model for the company is going to be the high 30s",Neutral
"But I do think that once those businesses get to a level of scale, because they'll be kind of early-stage businesses, I think once they get to scale, I think that we will be able to get the company model back to the low 40s EBITDA",Neutral
"And I think that given the nature of the adjacent areas, I think that they have significant opportunities for EBITDA that's more like our Performance and Security EBITDA",Neutral
"But obviously, it's going to take a time for those businesses to ramp to be able to realize that, and I think what we want to do is we don't want to constrain investment",Neutral
"Yes, yes",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
I would say that the more of the growth has been coming from selling more into our installed base,Neutral
"I think Tom's right that Security's been a product category that we've been able to penetrate with new customers, and then once you get in you can Land and Expand them",Neutral
You can expand it via other offerings,Neutral
But I'd say more of the growth to date has come from penetration into the installed base,Neutral
"And then I think you're going to see us do more in the way of new customer acquisition, Land and Expand model, and I think some of the new offerings are actually going to help us with that",Neutral
"Well, I think, again, I think you should look at our depreciation expense (54:31) as a percent of revenue to take the depreciation expense that we've been incurring as a percent of revenue",Neutral
"And as you ramp CapEx, as a percent of revenue you should be ramping depreciation as a percent of revenue in a similar way",Neutral
We don't really operate on an overflow basis,Neutral
That's one thing that we've seen in the past,Neutral
I just think it'll be a lower percentage of revenue going forward,Neutral
No,Neutral
I think you're going to see a steady increase in investment throughout the year,Neutral
"I think you're going to see that investment occur, it's going to begin in the first quarter",Neutral
"So I think you'll probably â€“ I'm not going to specifically guide for Q2, but as I said beyond the first quarter, which I said 39% to 40%, and I think that it will be 39% to 40% depending upon where our revenue lands in the range",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"So as Tom mentioned, the declines we've seen in these large customers were much more significant in 2016. So the wraparound impact of that really began a little bit in Q4 and you're going to see that continue in Q1. And so some of it is the wraparound effect of these customers not having nearly the impact on the company growth rates as they did a year ago",Negative
"My comment was more of a sequential comment that Q4 to Q1 we always see some seasonal declines in the company revenues and also with these big customers, and I expect to see that happen",Negative
"And as I mentioned, I think some of the seasonal decline is going to be much more notable in the Media business, and I think you're going to see steady growth in the Performance and Security business",Neutral
"Yeah, roughly, yes",Neutral
I wasn't referring to a specific timeframe,Neutral
I think you know the company has been operating in double-digit revenue growth,Neutral
This is actually the first year we have not,Neutral
The company growth rate outside of them has been growing in the mid-teens,Neutral
So we have been growing in the double-digits,Neutral
"I think that my point was that as we make these investments, these investments are going to take a bit of time to see revenue ramp, and so you're going to see the dividends from these investments more in 2018 and 2019. And I think that is what's going to lead to consistent double-digit growth for the company",Neutral
"We're pretty pleased with our international growth, but you're right that our international growth has been growing very fast and growing very fast particularly in our Asia-Pacific region",Positive
"So our investments are much more weighted, I would say, on R&D innovation, to be frank",Neutral
Our investments are not heavily weighted towards more go-to-market,Neutral
I actually think the go-to-market side of the equation â€“ we will make some investments there,Neutral
It's a matter of giving our existing sales force more products to sell,Neutral
"Our sales force is pretty confident that penetrating our products into their installed base set of customers is a matter of giving them more products to sell, and I think that by stepping up investment in R&D, getting more products announced, I think will lead to kind of more revenue",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"I mean, I think in general that we continue to get good traction in upgrading Ion to our customers that buy our Web performance products that you can imagine that it's kind of a hierarchy of â€“ it starts with customers that really, really care about performance",Positive
"And so I think we have a further room there, but I think that kind of the customers that are going to buy Ion â€“ many of them are already buying their products",Neutral
"If they're DSA, now they can buy Imagine Manager",Neutral
"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
"As Tom highlighted, Q1 was another solid quarter for Akamai with both revenue and earnings coming in at the high end of our guidance range",Neutral
"revenue in the first quarter was $609 million, up 7% year-over-year or up 8% in constant currency, and up 13% if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers",Neutral
"revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $369 million, growing 18% year-over-year and was the driver of delivering to the high end of our guidance in the quarter",Positive
"Performance and Security Solutions contributed over 60% of our total revenue in Q1. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our highly differentiated, higher margin and more stable subscription model offerings",Positive
"Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines with particularly strong growth continuing in our Cloud Security Solutions",Positive
"First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $110 million, up 37% year-over-year",Neutral
Our Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of $450 million,Neutral
"We are pleased with the continued strong growth and execution of our Cloud Security business, led by our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic offerings and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas, like bot management and Enterprise Application Access",Positive
"And we plan to further broaden our performance, security and enterprise offerings where we see substantial long-term growth potential",Neutral
"And our recent SOASTA acquisition, which closed in early April, is a good example of extending our market-leading Web acceleration offerings into the natural adjacency of Digital Performance Management focusing on cloud application monitoring and testing and aligning performance to business value",Neutral
"Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $187 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers",Neutral
"This revenue growth rate was lower than the past several quarters and below our expectations, driven by a moderation of traffic growth throughout the quarter in our Americas region and within our gaming vertical, most notably",Neutral
"As we've discussed in the past, the drivers of the Media business, namely traffic volumes and price, can lead to revenue variability from period to period given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points; the size, timing and delivery mechanism of software and gaming releases; as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities",Neutral
"And while Media growth rates have moderated more than we expected in the near term, we continue to remain bullish on the longer-term secular growth trends for our Media business, particularly in the OTT area, as more video content moves online",Positive
"Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year",Neutral
"Turning now to our Q1 revenue results by customer division, revenue from our Web Division customers was $305 million, up 15% year-over-year",Neutral
"We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with Cloud Security offerings",Positive
"revenue from our Media Division customers was $285 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 11%, excluding the impact of the large Internet platform customers",Neutral
This growth rate was lower than 2016 levels driven by the moderation in media traffic that I mentioned earlier,Neutral
"Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $19 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year",Neutral
"Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 33% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from Q4 levels",Neutral
"International market revenue was $203 million in the first quarter, up 19% year-over-year or up 21% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region",Positive
Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and $2 million on a sequential basis,Neutral
revenue from our U.S,Neutral
"market was $407 million, up 2% year-over-year",Neutral
continued to weigh heavily on the U.S,Neutral
market growth rates,Neutral
"Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q4 levels and the same period last year",Neutral
"GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66%, down 1 point from Q4 levels and consistent with the same period last year",Neutral
GAAP operating expenses were $288 million in the quarter,Neutral
"These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items",Neutral
"Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $228 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels, but above our guidance range, driven by higher commissions and performance incentives as well as increased recruiting-related spend associated with an uptick in hiring activity",Neutral
"Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $241 million, down $6 million from Q4 levels, due to seasonal revenue declines, and up $7 million from the same period last year",Negative
"Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 39%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from Q1 last year and within our guidance range",Neutral
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $87 million in the first quarter,Neutral
"These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense",Neutral
"Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $165 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines and up $1 million from the same period last year",Negative
"Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from the same period last year and within our guidance range",Neutral
"Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was $5 million, up slightly from Q4 levels",Neutral
Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million,Neutral
"As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results",Neutral
"Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $81 million or $0.46 of earnings per diluted share",Neutral
"Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share and at the high end of our guidance, driven by the strong revenue achievement",Positive
"For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%",Neutral
Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%,Neutral
Now I'll review some balance sheet items,Neutral
"Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 58 days, up four days from Q4 levels and down two days from the same period last year",Neutral
"Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $94 million and at the midpoint of our guidance",Neutral
Cash flow generation continued to be solid with cash from operations of $143 million in the first quarter,Positive
"Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter",Positive
"If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is just under $900 million",Neutral
"As we discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times, including the repurchase program",Neutral
"Over the past five years, we have lowered the company's share count by over 7 million shares or 4% while also spending nearly $1 billion in strategic acquisitions, thereby deploying capital in areas that we believe are in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders",Neutral
"In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company",Positive
"There has been a level of consistency in what we've talked about every year, the favorable market trends, the uniqueness in differentiation of the Akamai platform, the leadership position we maintain and the very rapidly changing and evolving cloud ecosystem and a tremendous amount of innovation we've seen across the business and new product adjacencies as well as continued enhancements within our existing core offerings",Neutral
"Innovation is alive and well across all the divisions, and we believe it will be a key enabler for accelerating growth back to double-digits for the company",Neutral
The fundamentals of our business remain strong,Neutral
We're continuing to innovate rapidly,Neutral
"And while our investments in new adjacencies will pressure margins in the near term, we believe they will drive significant future top-line and bottom-line growth",Neutral
"And I certainly believe that if we continue to execute, we will remain a compelling investment proposition for investors",Positive
"Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect Media growth rates to continue to moderate from Q1 levels and within Americas gaming vertical, most notably",Positive
"While it is also possible that Media growth rates moderate in the back half of 2017 as well, we remain bullish in the medium- to long-term growth prospects for this business, especially the potential for an increase in the amount of video traffic that could move online",Neutral
"Factoring in the anticipated moderation of Media growth, we are expecting overall Q2 revenue in the range of $597 million to $609 million",Neutral
"At the high end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% in constant currency, consistent with Q1 levels and up 2 points from Q2 2016 levels",Neutral
"At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of $6 million compared to Q2 of last year and a positive impact of $3 million sequentially",Neutral
"At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 65% and cash gross margins of 76%",Neutral
"Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $235 million to $241 million, up roughly $10 million sequentially at the midpoint",Neutral
"This increase is driven partly by our continued investment in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling and partly from absorbing our recent SOASTA acquisition",Positive
"Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate EBITDA margins of roughly 37%",Neutral
"And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q2 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to continue to make investments in the business throughout 2017 in the areas outlined earlier even while the Media business experiences a near-term moderation in revenue growth",Positive
"We believe these are important investments that will enable us to drive accelerated, sustainable, long-term double-digit top and bottom line growth",Neutral
"We are confident we can manage the company within our 37% to 39% EBITDA model, while we may go through some quarters where EBITDA margins fall slightly below these levels, possibly even in the second half of 2017. As I've said in the past, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins within our stated ranges is heavily dependent on revenue volumes, possible M&A and needed investments in the business",Neutral
"Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $77 million to $79 million",Neutral
"Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $42 million to $44 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29%",Neutral
"On CapEx, we expect to spend $110 million to $115 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter",Neutral
"This is an uptick from Q1 levels, primarily due to some planned facility and IT upgrades as well as continued expansion of our Secure Delivery Network and Prolexic scrubbing capacity",Positive
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
So that has not changed,Neutral
Nothing has changed about what we believe are the growth prospects for the Media business,Neutral
"Relative to our Investor Summit is that what we did see is that we did see traffic growth moderate, as I mentioned in the Americas region in particular and very notably in our gaming vertical and it moderated throughout the quarter",Neutral
So it was relatively strong in January and then it moderated in February and then it moderated further in March,Positive
"I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10%",Neutral
"And, Jim, your comment about Performance and Security, it continues to be a very strong growth for the company",Positive
"The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens",Positive
So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned,Neutral
So it's not uncommon to go through these periods,Neutral
"But I believe we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential, not just for OTT, but also within gaming",Neutral
So we're bullish about the prospects for media,Neutral
We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers,Neutral
And our Media Division customer growth was about 10%,Neutral
"We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services",Positive
"At the midpoint, you're going to see a further moderation of media growth rates and that's really kind of what it's all about",Neutral
"Well, let me start and then I can have â€“ Tom can talk a little about the products",Neutral
I think you're right that the growth rates in Security were in the kind of the high-40%s and then the low-40%s and now they're in the high 30%s,Neutral
Five years ago this was just a idea,Neutral
"So this business is growing very, very rapidly",Neutral
"Its growth rate on a percentage basis is lower because it's on a much, much bigger base",Neutral
This is not license model,Neutral
"So Tom can talk a little bit about the product categories, but there's a lot going on there",Neutral
"Colby, there was really no revenue for any of those",Neutral
Those were more technology tuck-ins,Neutral
"There's certainly some revenue that comes with SOASTA, as I mentioned, but the first three that you mentioned really were more of technology capability acquisitions",Neutral
"No, you're absolutely right about the international growth, that the growth rates are very different in the European markets than the Asia Pacific markets",Neutral
"And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing very, very strong growth in the Asia Pacific markets",Positive
"We are not seeing nearly the same level of growth in the European markets, but we have pretty good growth rates also in Europe",Neutral
"They're not the same as in Asia Pacific, but I'd say international growth rates at 21%, heavily fueled by Asia Pacific with decent growth in EMEA",Neutral
And that's probably not uncommon,Neutral
And you could take the OTT question,Neutral
"No, I think we always plan our CapEx in alignment with where we believe traffic growth is going to be",Neutral
"So, yes, we will dial CapEx in alignment with our revised projections, but we need to continue to build out as traffic grows and we don't have CapEx just for our Media business that while our Media business is certainly the most CapEx intensive that we do build our CapEx, as I mentioned, with our rapidly growing Security business, we're building out more attack capacity for Prolexic",Positive
And so there is a level of investment that's going on in CapEx,Neutral
"Even though security is not heavily CapEx-oriented business, it does have some CapEx",Neutral
"The other thing is, as we continue to make investments in R&D, we're going to capitalize more R&D, which is basically new product incubation",Positive
So there's a bunch of areas of CapEx many of which will continue to grow,Positive
Our expectation is that we'll manage CapEx and align it with traffic and revenue projections,Neutral
"I did signal that because I think you know that EBITDA is a function of a lot of things, revenue and volumes being the most notable",Neutral
"And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers",Neutral
And so we don't want to curtail investment there,Neutral
"And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case",Negative
"I was just being cautious that if we do dip below 37%, I wanted to make sure that people realize our intention is to manage the company to 37% to 39% EBITDA",Neutral
And I forgot what your second question was?,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
So we certainly have the expectation that we're going to return to double-digit growth in 2018. That's still where we believe we can be,Neutral
So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens,Neutral
"But, as you know, we've been through these periods before and then media growth roars again",Neutral
"I mean, I would say that we manage the company as a portfolio and we look at all the investments that we want to make in product areas and what we believe kind of the return on investment is going to be for each one of them",Neutral
"And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, that our Performance, Security, and Enterprise offerings, have 50% EBITDAs even with the investments that we've been making",Neutral
"And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company",Neutral
"You see margin expansion happen very, very rapidly",Neutral
That's a bit of the nature of the Media business,Neutral
And so it wouldn't be wise for us to curtail investments in the business because of some short-term disruption in Media growth rates,Neutral
"And it's been that way for a long, long time",Neutral
"But I think we'll continue to see competition from startups, from the traditional players, and from the cloud providers",Negative
"And we fare well against the competition, especially in situations where quality matters",Neutral
"The first question on are we worried about the big broadcasters as they start their own services and grow and so forth, doing more themselves? I don't think so",Neutral
I think it's going in the other direction,Neutral
"Generally speaking, those folks are taking, doing less in-house maybe than they did before",Neutral
So I don't see that's an issue,Neutral
"If anything, it's going in the other direction",Neutral
"And there's competition there and their users, the end viewers, demand the higher-quality video as you get better devices into the home, I think just the opposite happens",Neutral
"I think when you come to a renewal for the same product, they always want to lower price",Neutral
"On the other hand, maybe there's more traffic, which helps",Neutral
And the best part is we've got a lot of new products,Neutral
"So there's more to bring to bear in the account, which helps us hold price or grow revenue in the base",Neutral
And so we are seeing revenue growth in the base of customers with our Performance and Security products,Neutral
We don't actually report customer count,Neutral
We have done that for some time,Neutral
So really not much to comment there,Neutral
Let's flip over to page four,Neutral
"Removed the noise though and it was a terrific 2016. Let's start with pro forma revenue of $7.4 billion, up 15% from 2015. We estimate that elevated redemption activity in Q4 added about $175 million or 3% growth to 2016. Essentially, AIR MILES that would have redeemed in 2017 were instead redeemed in 2016 ahead of the expiry, creating a pull forward of revenue recognition to 2016. Adjusted for that, revenue was approximately $7.2 billion, up 12% and consistent with the guidance",Positive
Let's turn over and talk about LoyaltyOne,Neutral
"Adjusting the breakage reset and revenue pull forward added the number, we estimate that revenue and adjusted EBITDA for LoyaltyOne both increased about 4% for 2016. Let's begin with BrandLoyalty which had a terrific year with high single-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA",Neutral
market could be a growth driver in 2017 based upon early successes,Neutral
"We believe issuance growth will return to 3% range in 2017. In addition, we reduced the breakage rate for the AIR MILES Dream [ph] program for 26% to 20% at the end of 2016. The first 1.5 point reset resulted from higher than expected Q4 redemption activity",Neutral
"However, the second 4.5 point reset is different and that it was driven by the enactment of a new law and one-time event, thus we headed it back for adjusted EBITDA and core EPS purposes",Neutral
Flipping over to Epsilon,Neutral
"It was a disappointing year for Epsilon as revenue increased 1% while adjusted EBITDA decreased 6%, both substantially less than our 5% growth expectations for '16. Breaking down revenue by key offering, let's start with the good â€“ collectively auto, CRM, affiliates and data grew revenue, double digits compares to 2015. In addition, after a slow start to 2016, due to the pull back of a large client, agencies growth rate turn positive in the back after the year",Negative
Let's now shift to the problem childs; technology platform growth turn negative mid-year due to some flying attrition,Neutral
This offering alone was a 3-point drag to Epsilon's revenue growth,Neutral
"Turning to adjusted EBITDA, we start off the year in a big hole, down 22% in Q1. By significantly lowering our expense base, we cut that to a modest 9% in Q2, turn to flat in Q3 and then up 30% in Q4. We believe that our lower expense base will enable us to be more price-competitive on certain product offerings going forward",Neutral
Let's now flip over to card services on page seven,Neutral
It was another stellar year for card services with 24% growth in revenue and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA net despite over $200 million built and allowance for loan losses,Positive
Growth in the core weekends as the year progressed is comparable sales growth turn negative at several of our large apparel-focused clients,Positive
Gross yields after being down in Q1 through Q3 due to cardholder changes made to the program in 2015 stabilized and increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that these changes have fully burned in at this point,Negative
"We continue to receive operating leverage, operate expenses up 21%, compared to revenue growth at 24% for 2016. As a percentage of average card receivables, operating expenses decreased 50 basis points compared to 2015. Average receivables growth remained robust at 24% for 2016. Growth slowed over the course of 2016, due to softness in core spending as discussed before, resulting at ending card receivables growth of about 20%",Negative
"The principal loss rate was 5.1% for 2016, just slightly higher than original guidance, primarily due to this low and receivables growth rate",Positive
This creates what we call the denominator effect,Neutral
"Importantly, losses continue to track in line with our delinquency expectations for 2017 as we show on the wedge",Negative
"With that, I will it over to Ed",Neutral
I'm right there with you,Neutral
I do,Neutral
I think yields should be stable,Neutral
That will be our top priority,Neutral
"As the year progresses, if we don't see any further M&A opportunity, we could increase the buy back and be even more active",Positive
"What I would say, Bob, from a free cash flow standpoint, expect it to be up 7% to 10% in '17 over '16. Again, we'll have money we're keeping back at the banks, but it's a little bit of slow in growth than they are",Positive
That will diminish a little bit,Neutral
We consider the $500 million in terms of guidance,Neutral
"Again, what has happened is you have a certain band of credit that you cater to and coming out of the great recession, we had people who were signing up for the card, who are at the very high end as the recovery continued and the people repaired their credit",Positive
It's not like things are getting worse,Neutral
"A year ago we had a strong conviction that this would be sort of a year and-a-half, two-year cycle to normalize",Positive
We're past the first 12 months,Neutral
"I think that's very possible, Sanjay",Neutral
"Thanks, Ed",Neutral
"Letâ€™s start with Slide number 3, and if you look at our start to 2017, it was better than expected with revenue of 12% to a $1.88 billion and core EPS of 2% to $3.91. Both exceeded guidance for the first quarter, which is a very good start",Positive
Adjusted EBITDA net was flat at $440 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. A $72 million reserve billed at Card Services and a $17 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA at AIR MILES due to the breakage reset at the end of 2016 dampen the growth rate for the quarter,Positive
"First, that Epsilon could return to positive revenue in adjusted EBITDA growth and that we could stabilize the technology platform offering",Positive
"We would say weâ€™re on track; especially I view it as very strong Q1. Second, the credit normalization will conclude by the end of 2017 with a check as weâ€™re definitely tracking to the wedge on Slide 11. Third, that we can retool the AIR MILES model to replace loss to EBITDA from the breakage reset",Positive
"Weâ€™ll start with AIR MILES, and AIR MILES revenue decreased 6% to $181 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease is largely due to a 4% decline in AIR MILES redeemed which was expected given the elevated redemption activity in 2016. The burn rate which were miles redeemed divided by miles issued was still elevated during the first quarter of 2017 due to a backlog that carried over from 2016. But we expect it to normalize at about a 78% burn rates for full year 2017. AIR MILES adjusted EBITDA decreased 32% to $35 million or a 20% EBITDA margin",Negative
BrandLoyalty revenue and adjusted EBITDA decreased 6% to $152 million and 14% to $24 million respectively compared to the first quarter of 2016. The declines are largely due to program timing between years as well as unfavorable FX rates been a 3-point drag on both,Negative
"Itâ€™s the first quarter in some time that I actually enjoy talking about the Epsilon results, as we started the year very strongly with revenue up 7%, adjusted EBITDA up 5% a very nice flow through the top line growth to adjusted EBITDA",Positive
And there was a better balance of revenue growth in the key product categories than weâ€™ve seen in some time,Positive
"This offering turn quickly in 2016 as growth rates went from plus 5% growth in Q1 to flat in Q2 to minus 4% in Q3 and then minus 13% in Q4. The change in 2016 was due to the loss of a few key clients midyear, importantly the client base has since been very stable",Positive
"Lastly Conversant Agency was down 28% compared to the first quarter of 2016. This offering has been a consistent drag now for about nine quarters, but itâ€™s now reaching a level where at less than 5% of Epsilonâ€™s revenue, it appears to be stabilizing",Negative
"revenue increased 22%, just slightly over $1 billion for the first quarter of 2017 driven by strong gross yields which increased 80 bps compared to first quarter 2016. Operating expenses increased only 3% to $360 million for the first quarter and expressed as a percentage of average card receivables decline to 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016 that is a very strong start to the year in terms of expense leveraging",Positive
"Now with that, Iâ€™ll turn it over to Ed",Neutral
Itâ€™s a great question David,Neutral
"Weâ€™re now up to about 1,300, I believe",Neutral
"On the reserve side, Darrin, the reserve was 6.6% in reservable AR at 12 â€“ sorry, at March 31. What I would expect is the provision build, that reserve build, which was $72 million in Q1, should drop probably below $50 million Q2 â€“ below $50 million Q3. Q4 is really going to come down to growth and whether we see any type of bulk acquisition coming through",Positive
So I think that your questionâ€™s right,Neutral
"But what youâ€™re really trying to do with the Epsilon model is always make sure the revenue growth rate is better than the payroll growth rate, and we definitely did that in the first quarter",Positive
"Yes, the only thing I would add, and I think this is a very important piece, historically, when weâ€™ve had a retailer just basically go out of business, going through liquidation, the loss rates in that portfolio are no different than the overall portfolio experience",Neutral
"So to Edâ€™s point, you lose the opportunity",Neutral
They canâ€™t go on to the store and spend,Neutral
Iâ€™d say thereâ€™s none in particular,Neutral
"As part of what Ed talked about, how we had to shift to a little bit more of a packaged product to lower the costs, lower pricing, what you have seen us do is as weâ€™ve had renewals since then, we had come down a little bit on the pricing",Negative
So weâ€™d say that base is stable,Neutral
"As Ed talked about before, weâ€™re expecting it to basically return to flat growth year-over-year probably as early as Q3. So we think that weâ€™ve addressed the salient issues with the technology platforms",Neutral
And we think the changes weâ€™ve made have really put this back in place frankly to return it to a growth offering versus where it declined over the last three quarters,Neutral
"I would expect that â€“ the EBITDA margins to be fairly consistent with the full service, maybe down a little bit",Positive
"Q3, Q4.",Neutral
Both would be strong,Neutral
"Obviously, Q1, it was extremely good",Neutral
"As Ed talked about, probably 20, 30 basis points versus a very strong start to the year",Positive
So itâ€™s the growth in the portfolio,Positive
Sure,Neutral
"Youâ€™re going down the right area, which is the way that CRM signings work is almost like a vintage, where in the first year youâ€™ll sign a group that maybe they do $50 million of revenue first year, $75 million second year, $100 million third year, and we are definitely benefiting at the same time that we are definitely benefiting from new clients",Positive
"Last year, we added about 33 new clients with CRM",Neutral
"This year, it could be an estimate as high as 50. So itâ€™s the combination of both the ability to leverage a new client for three to four years, get revenue growth, plus weâ€™re continuing to onboard new clients as people see â€“ companies see the value of the proposition we bring",Positive
It could pass a little bit through to gross yield,Neutral
So thereâ€™s a lot of moving parts,Neutral
But we would say steady state,Neutral
25.5% feels good for the year,Neutral
"It could up maybe 10, 20 basis points given further interest rate increases coming through",Neutral
"No, nothing to add to that",Neutral
Thanks Ed,Neutral
"revenue for the third quarter increased 1% to $1.9 billion, soft against our mid-single digit expectations, primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma negatively impacting the growth shields at Card Services, which knocked off about three points of growth",Positive
"That brings our corporate leverage ratio down to about 2.8x as of September 30, 2017 versus our covenant of 3.5x, leaving us with over $2 billion in available liquidity",Negative
Breaking it down by major business,Neutral
"AIR MILES revenue decreased 28% to $185 million for the third quarter of 2017, driven by a 43% decline in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed",Negative
"80% is our target, really, moving forward",Neutral
"We expect issuance growth to improve in the fourth quarter and in 2018. Importantly, we recently re-signed BMO, our largest AIR MILES sponsor, to a multi-year contract",Positive
"BrandLoyalty's fourth quarter is looking good, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA expected to increase double digits year-over-year",Positive
Let's go to Slide 5 and talk about Epsilon,Neutral
"Year-to-date, revenues has increased 5%, slightly better than annual guidance while adjusted EBITDA is essentially flat, soft compared with our annual guidance of 4% growth",Positive
revenue came in short of expectations as the growth rate in our digital offering slowed during the quarter,Positive
The pull back in digital growth also negatively impacted EBITDA margins for the third quarter,Positive
"Importantly, Epsilon's technology platform offering continued to show progress toward a promising turnaround, with revenue increasing 1% for the third quarter",Positive
"This is a significant improvement compared to the double-digit decline in the fourth quarter 2016. The client base is showing stability, and we've seen an increased win rate on the basis of the introduction of cloud-based more packaged products into the market",Negative
"Card Services produced another solid quarter growth, with revenue up 9% to $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA net up an even better 20%",Positive
"Average card receivables increased 14%, just under $16 billion, consistent with our expectation of mid-teens growth while credit sales increased 5% to $7.4 billion",Positive
"Recovery rates are still down year-over-year, pressuring the net loss rate, but we consider this pressure to be transitory as we shift collections back to internal",Negative
Our delinquency forecast continues to suggest flat to lower loss rates in 2018. This trend allowed us to slightly drop our reserve rate during the quarter while maintaining 12 months of forward coverage,Negative
"So what that means to our gross loss rates were down 18 bps year-over-year, take away the 15 basis points for the improved from the hurricanes, and that's roughly the flat year-over-year change in our gross loss rates",Negative
"With that, I will turn it over to Ed",Neutral
"Yes, so there's two things I'd point you, Dan",Neutral
"First is the gross yield decline year-over-year makes the percent growth look a bit higher, the 16% you referred to",Negative
"As a percentage of AR, it moved a nominal amount",Neutral
I think that's still on track,Neutral
That'd be correct as well,Neutral
"But let's say we hadn't had the influence of the hurricanes affecting our gross yields, the revenue growth would have been up 15% to 16%",Positive
"I'd say, Dan, we think the core is still very strong",Positive
I think that's the biggest thing we're looking at,Neutral
We would tell you the backlog is still strong,Neutral
Thanks,Neutral
That is the consolidated number,Neutral
"And again, it's rounded to three",Neutral
It's about 2.6% so aroundâ€¦,Neutral
That's really the metric we've been focusing on,Neutral
"I mean, we're looking basically â€“ yes",Neutral
"If we're looking to Q4, we would tell you putting Signet on the side line, we feel good gross losses will be down year-over-year in Q4. And that's going to be driven by the natural improvement you're seeing on delinquencies in that wedge",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"Obviously, growth imbalances influences it",Positive
There are certain programs that influence it,Neutral
But I think that's a very reasonable target,Neutral
It's about 20 basis points per year,Neutral
You make it very simple if you make a transaction,Neutral
So think about it this way,Neutral
It's pretty small,Neutral
We're going to look to divest it,Neutral
"But really, it goes back to something that Ed said before, is with the growth we're generating and now assume that coming onboard, we can look at different verticals and this is one we tested for several years, really, not a great vertical for us",Positive
We saw the same thing in September,Neutral
Thanks Andrew,Neutral
That's a lot of progress over a relatively short period of time as we continue to grow the volume of business with both our large enterprise customers as well as on our e-store,Positive
Total deferred revenue grew 18% against the tough compare last year when we attached very high percentage of maintenance contracts along with the last sale of perpetual licenses for individual products,Positive
tax that equates to $1.9 billion,Neutral
"I turn now to our outlook our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view of the past several quarters, but most of the mature markets performing relatively well, but many of the emerging markets have been challenging",Negative
With the new administration in the U.S,Neutral
Here our primary financial goals were resetting for fiscal 2018. We're projecting the total ARR growth will increase to between 24% and 26%,Positive
"Spending will be about flat and we expect the percentage of recurring revenue to increase to approximately 90% beginning in Q1. As we look at our outlook for Q1, keep in mind that total ARR growth and subscription additions will build over the course of the year",Positive
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"So it was a very strong quarter, it's good to see the cloud products which will be key to kind of the second wave of the transition that the cloud products begin to take off",Positive
"In terms of disclosure, I would say at this point well it's â€“ we're seeing good growth, still good growth off a small base and it's having a bigger effect obviously on subs and it is on ARR as that becomes material or we think it's clouding the results and making it too difficult to model that's will consider breaking it out",Neutral
"Yes, Sterling said another way",Neutral
"Ken, I don't think we can project that",Neutral
So the number is not unusual or unexpected for us,Neutral
"So I think of enterprises being heavier in Q4 and Q1, products subs are very strong, we mentioned that in the opening commentary that was the leading driver of the growth, 227,000 remodel sub adds during the quarter and cloud was also strong albeit from a smaller base",Positive
So we've had great insight into where this is headed and kind of how it's going to be interpreted and how the guidelines will be applied and going through what we're going through the business model transition,Positive
"We've built in into our products subscription, a fair amount of integrated cloud functionality such that a significant amount of the value comes not just from the executables that come down to the endpoint, but from the interaction with the cloud services",Negative
Yes,Neutral
"And one of the places where we are definitely accelerating acquisition of customers is also the cloud and as regions around the world whether they are emerging countries or places in Asia they come back to better economic health, they will contribute to this sort of overall unit volume growth",Positive
So we're feeling pretty confident,Neutral
We appreciate your interest in ADP,Neutral
"This quarter, we saw the continued benefits of strong prior period new business bookings and a strengthening in our retention metric which helped to drive organic revenue growth across all market segments",Positive
Our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share growing 20% to $0.87 per share,Positive
Jan will take you through the key contributing factors to our strong earnings performance in more detail shortly,Positive
"During the quarter we experienced a decline of 5% in new business bookings compared to a strong second quarter in fiscal 2016. These results reflect a continued difficult grow-over related to the tailwinds from our fiscal 2016 sales of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act, which was expected",Positive
"Accordingly, we continue to expect new business bookings growth in the second half of fiscal 2017, but in light of the second quarter decline, we have now revised our outlook and now expect to be about flat for fiscal 2017 as compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal 2016. The client experience remains a priority for us whether it's through investments in our service model, in innovation and the user experience or in our efforts to upgrade clients with the most appropriate strategic based platforms, we believe that we have the right strategy to address these continuously evolving needs and opportunities and we remain pleased with the progress we are making",Negative
Feedback on this acquisition from many of our mutual Fortune 100 customers has been extremely positive,Positive
"As we think about the future growth of ADP, we anticipate that investments such as these coupled with our ongoing organic investments in innovation, service and sales will enable us to continue to stay at the forefront of the HCM industry",Neutral
"For the last couple of quarters, we've been sharing our plans regarding our Service Alignment Initiative and I'm excited to highlight for you that we've been making great progress",Positive
"In fact, I believe that we're in a firm position for sustained growth and success as we continue to make the technology and service investments to further increase the strategic value of the HR function",Positive
It's a great question,Neutral
"Obviously, there are two factors that are affecting the growth in our new business bookings",Positive
"And in particular, one of the things that I noted, I've seen a chart that shows â€“ I believe it's the NFIB confidence index, but small business confidence indexes are kind of off the charts positive and in a strange way, it's a little bit reflective of kind of what we're experiencing which is continued success which we don't give guidance by segment, but we have very good and strong new business bookings results in our down market and not so much in our mid and upmarket",Positive
"So there's a lot of moving parts and hopefully that provides you a little bit of color, but we don't have really great precise scientific tool to be able to ascertain how much of the weakness is coming from each factor",Positive
"So there's a number of things that are in play by the administration, generally speaking over 67 years we have benefited from whether it's one particular party or another particular party or one philosophy versus another philosophy because generally there's change, there's constant change and I think, employers use services like ours to help them manage through that change",Neutral
"As you can see from our retention notes, we haven't add â€“ I think, Jan makes a great point which is what's fascinating is obviously the challenge for us right now is the new business bookings, but we haven't had cancellations or in fact we have clients that are still being implemented on ACA, but it's natural that once you've made a decision and you're committed and you're on the path and it is the law, by the way, it still is the law, it makes sense to go forward, but I can see how some people, if they're doing it in-house or doing it themselves might be hesitant to make a decision given the uncertainty around what's actually going to happen regarding the law",Positive
"Well, I didn't say the new business bookings growth was weak in the PEO, we don't give segment reporting with details of our bookings",Positive
"I was just trying to give you a general flavor because, as you saw, we also had some weakness on the revenue growth, but that wasn't necessarily related to ACA, but just in general, I was trying to convey that there is some logical, I guess, explanation to some of what's happening in the sense that there appears to be a lot of optimism on the part of small businesses and we're seeing that reflected in parts of our business",Negative
"In other parts of the business the results are mixed because we do, I think, see as a result of the fact that 50% of the PEO's business comes from referrals of our existing payroll sales force, to the extent that that sales force is encountering some slower decision-making, particularly in the midmarket, and also encountering some slow decision-making as a result of uncertainty about ACA that is expected to have and is having some impact on the PEO",Neutral
"But to be clear, the weakness in the revenue growth of the PEO was almost exclusively the pass-through revenues and lower inflation in health benefits and a slight slowing in benefits participation which is probably also related to a, quote unquote, peaking of ACA implementations",Positive
"So that slowing trend of benefits participation coupled with lower inflation of benefits per worksite employee is what led to slower growth, if you will, in the PEO, but the 12% worksite employee growth is still very, very strong, so we're still very happy with what we consider to be net revenue growth in the PEO which is now growing almost in line with worksite employees whereas historically had grown a little bit faster because of this pass-through cost pressure",Positive
So I hope that helps a little bit,Neutral
"And it's certainly isn't for lack of head count, so we're in a strong position from a sales force capability standpoint",Positive
"I think we also have â€“ I think our expectation is a little bit of a return of the growth of the PEO pass-through cost, which I think that just mathematically also adds to â€“ I think the last part of your question was a broad PEO margin pressure question about ADP, but in this first half, second half it is a factor",Neutral
"So even though the PEO has an absolute lower margin, the fact that its margin has been improving as much as it has combined with the slower growth of pass-through costs made this a moot point for the first two quarters of this year",Positive
And I think what you have from us is a commitment to really make sure that we have a lot of transparency around because we do a lot of what-if scenarios around the next two to three years what the PEO margin expectation is versus the ES margin expectation and the overall ADP,Neutral
"If we have a lot of inflation and pass-through costs, we might have to revisit that topic just because of the pure mathematics, not because of the quality of the business or the strength of the business, just because of the math that I think you're implying",Neutral
"No, I think that â€“ Jan may have something to add, but we had a great quarter earnings-wise, so that helps because we obviously provide guidance based on what we really think is going to happen",Positive
"So I think we feel good about where we are in terms of our expenses, even though Jan described very well this issue of we've lapped our ACA revenues, and we had already lapped our ACA expenses for the last two quarters",Neutral
"But in general when we look at the quality and the trajectory of the business, we feel pretty good other than this issue in new business bookings, which ironically helps our margin in the first half of the fiscal year",Neutral
"And when you look at 20 years of data, our new business bookings growth over the course of rolling four quarters because obviously any one quarter can have issues like we just experienced",Positive
"We had for example Y2K 20 years ago but, in general, follows very, very closely almost a smooth line what's happening with the economy, as does our pays per control growth",Positive
"So our pays per control growth when unemployment is going up, tends to go down and vice versa",Positive
"But since that doesn't appear to be the environment that we're entering at least for now, we feel that we're going to rely on this historical data and I think plan on returning to historical growth rates in our new business, and our new business bookings",Neutral
"And that's a global statement, not just a U.S",Neutral
"And so we like where we are, we like the space we operate in, and we're optimistic about, I think, the future, although obviously, we're not exactly happy about what's happening in the short term here",Negative
"And I think â€“ I'll just add that I think we are working on these types of products and others in order to drive not just incremental revenue from the products themselves, but to gain market share and to win more new business",Neutral
"I think Jan described it well which is it's a very broad strategy around differentiation and strengthening our products, as well as we don't mind earning a little bit of extra revenue and income from selling those types of products",Neutral
"Yes, we're still on track",Neutral
And very excited about it,Neutral
"So again, caution that given the $12 billion of revenue, if it wasn't obvious from our comments, this is not an immediate game changer from a revenue growth standpoint, but it's an immediate game changer from a strategic standpoint and from a brand standpoint",Positive
No,Neutral
"And so we obviously fully expect to return to stronger new business bookings growth as these compares get a little bit easier and hopefully as some of this uncertainty wears off, but I think that your math is dead on, which is why you hear us still remaining optimistic",Positive
You're referring to new business bookings? Or,Neutral
"I'm not sure I understand, sorry, the question",Neutral
The,Neutral
"Jan, I think that â€“ sorry",Neutral
"Maybe I didn't at first understand the question, but I did look last night at sales force productivity over the last few years",Neutral
"And as you can imagine, now our average productivity per sales rep is down, but largely driven by ACA",Negative
"We had two years of 13% and 12% new business bookings growth, fiscal years, and I don't know the last time that we had ever done that",Positive
"So clearly, maybe we didn't emphasize enough how much help we were getting",Neutral
We've got to now focus on fundamentals,Neutral
We've got to go back to selling new clients and the old-fashioned approach of ADP of having a reasonable mix of head count growth and productivity growth,Positive
"And I think when I look through the numbers and try to normalize for ACA, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of head count and also sales force productivity",Neutral
"It may have already come out, we don't know",Neutral
"But besides higher interest rates, which are going to be beneficial to ADP, we think this is going to be beneficial to ADP's new business bookings and to our approach to the market, which is to help our clients and products exactly with this topic",Neutral
"And I think when that happens, I think some of the products and solutions that we've developed, this acquisition that we've just done with TMBC, I think, position us well to help our clients with that",Neutral
"We're very excited about what that's going to do for the quality and long term cost of our service, and as you heard from us today, we're certainly not backing down on our distribution channel",Positive
So we appreciate your time today,Neutral
"ADP revenues for the quarter grew 5% on a reported basis, 6% organic",Positive
Our revenue growth this quarter experienced pressure as we began to lap our fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues,Positive
"Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew 4% on a reported basis to $828 million, despite almost 2 percentage points of combined pressure from our second quarter business disposition and our fiscal year 2017 acquisitions",Positive
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 4%,Positive
"Our margins this quarter were impacted by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations cost related to our service alignment initiative",Positive
Our net earnings grew 10% on a reported basis to $588 million and benefited from a lower effective tax rate,Positive
Diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31 and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago,Positive
"However, we have continued to make investments into our sales organization to better position us for growth",Positive
"In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis for the quarter and included 1 percentage points of pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses earlier this fiscal year",Positive
Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S,Neutral
grew 2.5% in the third quarter,Neutral
"This decrease was driven by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations related to our service alignment initiative",Positive
"PEO revenues grew 12% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 12% to 471,000. The PEO continued to experience slowing growth in the benefit pass-through costs, resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation of our worksite employees during the quarter",Positive
New business bookings this quarter were down 7%,Neutral
"Despite our revised new business bookings guidance and this quarter's revenue retention decline, our revenue outlook remains unchanged at about 6%",Negative
"While Employer Services segment consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 3% to 4%, which continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency",Positive
"For the PEO, ADP continues to anticipate revenue growth of 13%",Positive
"For the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies and slower growth in our pass-through revenues as compared to fiscal year 2016 to help drive margin expansion on a full year basis",Positive
We are also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase to about $20 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of about $15 million,Positive
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
I think that's true,Neutral
"But, David, you're mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward",Positive
"And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth",Positive
And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong,Positive
We were happy with it and we take it,Neutral
It's good for our shareholders,Neutral
It's good for our revenues,Positive
But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind,Neutral
"And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind",Neutral
Now we have what I would call the political issue,Neutral
"And by the way, some of that happened to us",Neutral
So I think all three things are a factor,Neutral
"But unfortunately, we can't",Neutral
"Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted",Positive
And it's driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth,Positive
So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time,Positive
"But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities",Neutral
"But we'll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we're bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward",Positive
So we're preparing for growth in the future,Positive
"And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not",Neutral
And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket,Positive
"So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales",Positive
"And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP",Negative
So keep that in mind,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
And both have very similar dynamics,Neutral
So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it,Neutral
"And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits",Positive
The tenets translate into what you have heard,Neutral
"And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward",Positive
Thank you,Neutral
We appreciate your interest in ADP,Neutral
"This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results, with revenue growth up 6%, both for the quarter and the year",Positive
"revenue for the year was up 7% on an organic basis, benefiting from a solid 6% client growth and from the continued strong performance of our downmarket, PEO, and multinational solutions",Positive
The clients were concentrated in our mid- and upmarkets and the challenges were due in large part to growing over the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act,Positive
"Despite these challenges, the sales opportunities within the mid and upmarkets continue to demonstrates a solid environment with positive growth prospects",Positive
"During fiscal 2017, we increased our head count investments in our sales organization to better position us for growth during fiscal 2018 and beyond",Positive
Election,Neutral
"Accordingly, as we return to a more normalized growth trend, we expect fiscal 2018 new business bookings to grow 5% to 7%, gradually expanding back to pre-ACA growth levels as we progress through the year",Positive
"Our full-year retention was down 50 basis points to 90%, which also includes a 20 basis point impact from the loss of the Office of Personnel Management contract in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Please note that this contract was part of the CHSA business that we subsequently disposed-off during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. I would also like to remind you that the loss is contributing to our annual decline in retention remain concentrated on our legacy platforms in the mid- and upmarkets",Negative
"Last quarter, we mentioned the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect, where we are leveraging the scale of our strong 510,000-plus client base downmarket to create a compelling value â€“ to create compelling value for our referral partners",Positive
Adoption of Accountant Connect has been strong,Neutral
The value proposition of the PEO gets stronger as the complexities of managing the workforce increase and expectations of employees evolve,Positive
This global reach remains a truly differentiating capability for ADP and continues to meaningfully contribute to our growth,Positive
"In closing, we're pleased with our ability to response to the challenges we faced in fiscal 2017. This year, we began to see signs that are improving service metrics and our progress on client upgrades are helping to drive improvements and retention",Positive
Election,Neutral
"These dynamics, together with a continued strong performance of our multinational solutions, downmarket offerings, and the PEO, give us confidence heading into fiscal 2018. ADP is built for the long haul",Positive
Good morning,Neutral
"Well, I think as we've said in our comments, the midmarket, the PEO, multinational have all been quite strong",Positive
"In the midmarket, obviously, we had a very significant grow-over, given the strong sales for ACA products in 2016. But as we've kind of checked in with the sales force throughout the year, and frankly, continue to make investments to keep their heads in the game, we've maintained our turnover at almost exactly the same rate it was in the prior year, which is a very encouraging sign because, obviously, it was a very tight labor market",Positive
"But I think it's a sign of, I think, optimism on the part of the sales force that there is really no issue with the economy or with our products or competitively or with pricing that it's really just unfortunately a mathematical issue that got aggravated by some of this uncertainty that came out of Washington, which really stop people from buying not only â€“ or slowed the sales of ACA to a much lower level than we had planned, but I think just created some kind of short-term uncertainty after November",Neutral
"And I think if I you stick to like looking at 'our adjusted results,' then you shouldn't even worry about it for next year because the dual ops incremental expenses is minimal",Neutral
"So, there's really nothing to worry about",Neutral
"Well, I think that it's obviously very early",Neutral
We feel like we've gotten some great people,Positive
We've got great engagements,Positive
"So, we're very excited",Neutral
"And fortunately, it's on track as of now",Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
And we've done that again this year,Neutral
But it's $5 million to $10 million,Neutral
I think it's really related to the factors that we're seeing that Jan was talking about in terms of some of the revenue growth issues,Neutral
"And so, if you go back and you look at quarterly numbers, you will see that we had two strong quarters the first half of this fiscal year, and then now we just had two relatively weak quarters because of the grow over issues",Positive
"So we will have another two-week quarters because of the grow over issue at the beginning of fiscal 2018, and then our plans are that our sales return to near pre-ACA levels in the second half, as well as our revenue growth begins to once again gradually accelerate",Positive
"And likewise, the $175 million in revenue, even though it didn't come all in one year, a lot of it did come in January of 2016, which means that from a revenue standpoint, you also have, call it, a point or so of incremental growth that you've picked up from ACA",Positive
"And that's right about how the math works because on an organic basis, we're at about 7% growth this year, and we were at about 8% last year",Positive
"We've had good sales growth over multiple years, double-digit revenue growth, generating great margins because now we've got scale, and the business is â€“ I would just call it humming along",Positive
"We hope it will be at some point in the near future, but the international business, good, solid performance and really good margin performance as well where that business â€“ 10, 15 years ago, my predecessor, we struggled for years to really get that business to perform as well as the rest of ADP from a margin and ""retention standpoint,"" and I think we're kind of there now",Neutral
We're very happy with our international and multinational business,Positive
Multinational â€“ sorry,Neutral
And then what we call international,Neutral
So the multinational is $500 million,Neutral
"And then Canada, another $400 million",Neutral
So that's how you get to approximately 20%,Neutral
We are on track on the migrations,Neutral
But fortunately that's all behind us now,Neutral
"About 5,000 to 6,000 clients left",Neutral
And everything starts again in February,Neutral
"So the power that that business is going to have now, the focus â€“ and to focus on the competition and to focus on execution and NPS scores and retention is going to be, I think, equal to what we've done in the downmarket on RUN, and that gets me excited",Neutral
Sure,Neutral
The midmarket is different from the upmarket,Neutral
Some of them bleed across some of those segments,Neutral
"I think that gives us some advantages, which we leverage in terms of products and service capabilities, et cetera",Neutral
And obviously we are several billion,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
We would like to try to help there,Neutral
So the first two quarters of this fiscal year should not look that different from the first two quarters of this fiscal year from a revenue growth standpoint,Positive
"If our sales forecasts and our retention forecasts hold true, by the second half of this fiscal year, there will be gradual improvement on the revenue growth",Positive
"And I think in terms of the relative size of the PEO bookings, I don't know that we don't really give that guidance, but I don't think there's anything wrong with giving you a range of the sales dollars for TotalSource are somewhere around â€“ call it 20% to 25% â€“ 20-ish%, if you will, of the total bookings, somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit higher than that",Neutral
"And again, with good growth, obviously that's driving the top line revenue growth",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
I shouldn't have done that because Jan is right,Neutral
So the PEO had record retention,Neutral
"So if we really deliver great products and great service, the clients stay in all of the segments",Positive
"And again, I think it's getting all the clients on one platform so that you make all your investments and you put all your focus and all your R&D on one platform",Neutral
"So having everyone on one platform, going after kind of the friction and the things that create bad service experience and just good execution, all those things, I think you put them together, and it's really created a really great story for us that obviously is translating not only into great retention but great retention in these businesses leads to really great margin performance and really good revenue growth",Positive
And we know that our productivity jumped dramatically when we had ACA sales and obviously came back down when we didn't have that tailwind,Negative
But we have ways of getting at the numbers,Neutral
"And obviously, it doesn't happen in a vacuum",Neutral
You've got to have great products,Neutral
You've got to keep sales force turnover down,Negative
"As you are a very correct observer, Jim",Neutral
I think it's really too early to read anything into the fourth quarter sales results,Neutral
"But it was better than the alternative, so we're happy that we had the finish that we had",Positive
So maybe there's a little bit of that,Neutral
But we â€“ can't put my finger on it,Neutral
And we're happy to hear about it or address it,Neutral
That's why we have a higher effective tax rate,Neutral
It's relatively small,Neutral
It could be significantly positive,Neutral
But that probably happens to every CEO,Neutral
They always think that they have more competition than the previous person,Neutral
And we know that we have to earn our place every day in the marketplace by having competitive products and great service,Neutral
"And whenever we slip or trip, they take advantage",Neutral
"And whenever they slip or trip, we take advantage",Neutral
"And they try it and then maybe three years later, they go back, or sometimes they stay",Neutral
Sometimes they go away,Neutral
Thank you very much,Neutral
We appreciate your time today,Neutral
"I'm very proud â€“ it's year-end, so I think I should say that I'm very proud of the hard work and dedication of our associates who obviously have been able to help us deliver these results, including the improvements in the service experience and improvements in retention this quarter",Neutral
"So we believe that these investments, along with our ability to execute, I think, really give us the right formula for sustained, continued success for many years to come",Neutral
We appreciate your interest in ADP,Neutral
We're pleased with this revenue growth which was above our expectations,Positive
"revenue growth in the quarter includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure from the fiscal 2017 disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were substantially offset by the benefits from foreign currency",Positive
Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6% to $0.91 per share and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding,Positive
"Overall, this earnings growth in the quarter exceeded our expectations, and we're very pleased with our solid results, which Jan will walk through in more detail shortly",Positive
New business bookings during the first quarter were down 3% compared to the first quarter of 2017. This performance was in line with our expectations as we begin to realize the benefits of our fiscal 2017 head count investments while we continue to manage through the effects of the regulatory uncertainty that has prevailed since last year's U.S,Negative
elections,Neutral
"As we communicated previously, we continue to expect our bookings growth to gradually expand back to pre-ACA growth levels as we progress through the year",Positive
"As a result, we continue to anticipate full year fiscal 2018 new business bookings growth of 5% to 7%",Positive
"On the client retention front, we experienced a 160 basis point improvement during the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations and saw positive growth across all of Employer Services Markets",Positive
This performance is due in part to our continued efforts to upgrade clients to strategic cloud platforms as well as the investments we've made to improve the client service experience while also aided by the easier compare from our fiscal 2017 first quarter federal government OPM contract loss,Negative
"We also continue to make good progress on our Service Alignment Initiative where we now have 2,000 associates across our three new scalable service centers and 5,400 associates in total across all five of our strategic service locations, delivering service to clients across the HCM spectrum",Positive
The progress we are making with respect to new platforms and improved service is leading to happier clients and improvement in our NPS scores,Positive
Innovation is a job that's never done,Neutral
"ADP's unique ability to meet the needs of our clients today while anticipating their needs in the future have been hallmarks of our success over the past 68 years, and will drive our sustained growth in the years ahead",Positive
This is the DNA of ADP,Neutral
We are excited about this acquisition and we're pleased to welcome the Global Cash Card team to the ADP family,Positive
I'm proud of the efforts of our associates,Neutral
"Our results in the quarter continue to reflect the enduring qualities of ADP, including a culture that is relentlessly focused on delivering a great client experience through best-in-class technology and unparalleled service",Positive
"But this quarter, we happened to have good news and we're very happy about it",Positive
We think that is not just because of volatility but I think because some of the things we've been doing around investments in our service organization,Neutral
"We have about 2,000 left",Neutral
We may have a couple of stragglers,Neutral
I think the impact of that large loss was around 100 basis points last year,Neutral
Other than that it's getting really big,Neutral
And we're still pretty happy with 10% unit growth,Positive
That's one of the largest employers in the U.S,Neutral
which is becoming a very large base,Neutral
But we feel pretty happy and pretty satisfied with that kind of growth rate,Positive
I think we included there about 51% of our revenues being on our strategic platforms that I just mentioned the names of,Neutral
"So for example, our insurance services, our retirement services, we have some international platforms that we're happy with that we're not planning any movement there",Positive
"And I think starting off with the fact that we've increased our innovation spend from around $150 million to around $450 million, I think or somewhere thereabouts in that neighborhood, so it's a significant amount of increase in our R&D investment",Neutral
"But we've also made big investments in things like our data cloud and things like our mobile solutions and some of the other products and innovations that we actually already have out in the market and are helping us, I think, with our efforts in terms of helping our clients and also helping drive new business bookings and retention and so forth",Neutral
So it's increased slightly,Neutral
"So, I'm going to let Jan maybe go through a few of the numbers here",Neutral
"Clearly, it had an impact on the business",Neutral
We have a decent sized business in Puerto Rico,Neutral
"So, the fact that you're asking the question, I think shows the strength of ADP that we continued to perform and to deliver business as usual in the face of what was obviously a very, very challenging situation",Negative
It becomes the entire GDP eventually,Neutral
"So, it's safe to say that this is a number that has to, by definition, maybe not over a quarter or two or over one year, but that number has to at some point converge or regress back to the mean",Neutral
But we have had times where we've had even bigger differential between worksite employee growth and our pass-through revenue growth,Positive
"We'll try to help with that, but again, what we encourage people to do is to look at Employer Services margins and profit growth and the PEO's margins and profit growth",Positive
Right,Neutral
"Exactly, I mean that's ultimately the â€“ growth in Employer Services and profitability Employer Services and growth in PEO ultimately would drive return on invested capital and that's really the right way to focus on the business",Positive
"As you know, our PEO business is our most profitable, most successful, best business",Positive
"I think it's probably, it's both",Neutral
So I think it's both things,Neutral
"I think that one of the things we've been as we've been kind of going out talking to folks, making sure that this is an opportunity now to make sure everyone understands that the starting point for margins in terms of the amount of room there is for improvement was larger in the small business market than it is in the mid-market",Neutral
So we have a successful good business in the mid-market including healthy margins,Positive
"We do think that based on what we see around retention potential because the real, one of the really important improvement to the small business division was the rise in retention which has a fairly big impact in that business on margins because the amount of business you have to sell, which brings with it sales cost, implementation cost, is less to achieve the same growth objective if you will",Positive
"Better retention should have the same impact that it had on SBS in the sense that you have sell that much less business in order to achieve the same growth rate or you can grow faster, like it's either you get the best of both worlds that you can choose which way depending on market conditions you want to move",Positive
"They were higher to begin with in mid-market and the replatforming is really about strengthening our competitive position, driving faster growth and hopefully some modest improvement in margins as well because we do expect to get higher retention rates in the mid to long term as we get all of our clients onto one platform",Positive
"Yeah, and think I also want to point out again, I want to say it one more time that clearly some of the pressure we're experiencing is from investments, because we have been investing in our sales force for example",Neutral
"Because last year, in the first half of the fiscal year, so the last two quarters of the calendar year, we had almost 20% operating income growth, and then in the last two quarters of the fiscal year, first two quarters of the calendar year, because of the ACA grow-over in the comparisons of having lapped the revenues, the revenue comparison, we ended up having the numbers go in the opposite direction",Positive
"And then as we've said multiple times in our guidance, our second half of this fiscal year gets back from a margin standpoint, from a growth standpoint, from a bookings standpoint to a more reasonable normalized place, if you will",Positive
And it's not just about the platform,Neutral
Client stay 15 to 20 years on average,Neutral
"So we're really trying to do what ADP's been doing for many years with a slight change in emphasis, with greater emphasis on product and technology than maybe historically we had had 5, 10, 15 years ago",Neutral
"So the second part is a tricky question, because the way it gets shared, if you will, is it makes our company stronger",Positive
But we definitely appreciate it,Neutral
So it's all positive,Neutral
"So I think historically, I think it probably make us stronger, more competitive",Positive
I guess to be completely direct,Neutral
And so there's a long way to go to get back to that $300 million and that would not be even adjusting for inflation and for growth,Positive
And so you shouldn't say it either,Neutral
It could be used globally,Neutral
So we're not ready,Neutral
"They just, they create outcomes",Neutral
And then the cost of maintenance and the cost of support will go down significantly based on our business cases that we have for these back-office engines,Negative
"But we believe based on our business cases that obviously, whether it's two, five, seven years down the road, that new technology can help us leverage those services that we provide in a much more efficient manner",Negative
It's a great business and it's a good-sized revenue business fortunately it's around breakeven is the way we would describe it,Positive
"I think for bookings growth, what we try to look at is the noise in the system has been pretty significant in the last 24 months because first, we had ACA and then we didn't have ACA",Neutral
And we're now I think at about 7% head count growth year-over-year,Neutral
They have to get ramped up,Neutral
They have to get into the field,Neutral
We feel good about the future,Neutral
But I think it's premature,Neutral
We did get help from tax,Neutral
We did get a little bit of help from on the growth rate from the floating come,Positive
So I think it's just too early,Neutral
"But directionally, we feel good",Neutral
So we feel good about it,Neutral
"They're real and they're going to drive long-term efficiency, lower costs, stronger sales, better client experience",Positive
Thank you,Neutral
"As you could see, we're off to a really good start, and we're happy that the initiatives that we have around enhancing our service, the innovation of our products and expanding our distribution model are working",Positive
"And we have obviously a lot of confidence that I think the investments will continue to deliver the results we expected from those investments, especially in the latter half of fiscal 2018 and beyond",Neutral
"The dedication, I think, and the attentiveness and the integrity, more importantly, of our associates is what makes this company great and it's what our founder I think insisted on",Positive
"Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everyone",Neutral
"First, guidance",Neutral
"Specific to earnings, we expect adjusted EPS growth will be in the range of 13% to 15% in the middle of our 12% to 17% guidance range",Positive
"And third, tax rate",Neutral
"Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 28.6%, which was driven down by the impact of the Message Automation investment gain",Negative
I will now provide a quick recap of our results,Neutral
"Let's move to the drivers of our top line growth, which are laid out on page 6 of the presentation",Positive
"As I noted, total revenues grew 46% to $1.01 billion",Positive
"The acquisition of NACC, which occurred on the first day of the first fiscal quarter was the biggest driver of our total growth, contributing $277 million to our revenues",Positive
"Event-driven fee revenues, up 26%, were a nice contributor for our growth in the quarter, rising $12 million to $61 million",Positive
That increase contributed 2 points to our overall revenue growth in the third quarter,Positive
The impact of changes in foreign currency was a slight drag on our reported revenues but less an impact than it has been in recent quarters,Negative
Recurring fee revenues grew 30% to $592 million,Positive
"Excluding the impact of NACC and other acquisitions, organic recurring fee revenue growth was 4% in the third quarter",Positive
"The biggest driver of our organic growth with the impact of strong closed sales, which accounted for 7 points of growth was partially offset by 2 points of client losses",Positive
Internal growth was negative 1%,Positive
"Excluding the impact of the Accenture Post Trade Processing or APTP recontracted from a year ago, which I will discuss in my comments on the GTO segment results, internal growth would have been neutral, and organic recurring fee revenue growth was at 5%",Positive
"Organic growth contributed 5 percentage points to our recurring fee growth over the first nine months, with the balance coming from acquisitions, mostly, NACC",Positive
"Turning to slide 8. Adjusted operating income rose 22% to $134 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. That growth was driven by the acquisition of NACC, organic recurring fee revenue growth, and the impact of higher event-driven revenues",Positive
"Adjusted operating income margins declined from 15.9% to 13.2%, largely as a result of adding the lower-margin NACC business, partially offset by the increase in event-driven revenue and higher margins in the GTO segment",Negative
The second item was the tax rate,Neutral
The third item to point out is the share count,Neutral
A 1% decline in the weighted average shares outstanding also contributed modestly to our EPS growth,Negative
"ICS recurring fee revenues benefited from organic growth in our communications business and from growth in data and analytics, tax, and other new product lines",Positive
"As Rich noted, ICS revenues also benefited from a pickup in ETF and mutual fund interim position growth to 5%, as well as 6% stock record growth",Positive
"The growth in earnings reflects the impact of the NACC acquisition and higher event-driven revenues, which more than offset higher amortization expense related to the NACC and Inveshare technology acquisitions",Positive
"Next, to GTO",Neutral
"Organic growth was 3%, and recent acquisitions contributed another 3%",Positive
"Breaking down the organic growth, closed sales added 7 points of revenue growth, which netted to 5 points of Net New Business after client losses",Positive
"The contribution from Net New Business reflects the strong GTO sales results over the last couple of years, including some sales closed in fiscal year 2015. This meaningful lag between sales and revenue recognition highlights the number of larger deals we have been closing",Positive
"Similarly, as we consider the recent record sales results, many of the sales we have closed over the course of this fiscal year will not begin to have an impact on reported revenues until late fiscal 2018, 2019, and in some cases, even 2020. The growth in revenue attributed to Net New Business was offset by negative 2 points of internal growth",Positive
Our general growth comparison was impacted by the recognition of $4 million of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 related to the recontracting of a single APTP contract,Positive
"Excluding the impact of that revenue, internal growth would've been modestly positive; and GTO organic growth would've been 5%",Positive
"GTO earnings before taxes rose 10% to $44 million, as we continue to realize positive operating leverage, especially for Net New Business",Positive
We continue to expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 40% to 42%,Positive
"For recurring fee revenues, we were reaffirming our guidance of 29% to 31% growth",Positive
"With a lower than expected revenue contribution from NACC, we expect recurring fee revenue growth to be closer to the lower end of that range",Positive
"Excluding the impact of NACC, we expect recurring fee revenues to grow 6% to 7%, including organic growth of approximately 5%",Positive
We expect adjusted EPS growth to be in the middle of our 12% to 17% range or 13% to 15%,Positive
"One, we expect ICS, excluding NACC, have a nice finish to the year on recurring fee and earnings growth",Positive
"Two, NACC is expected to have a seasonally lighter contribution to the fourth quarter, and therefore, will be less meaningful to the quarter's earnings growth",Positive
Keeping our costs in check is critical to our overall growth strategy,Positive
"And these initiatives will help to position us for additional growth by enabling us to reinvest in our business, while delivering bottom line growth in fiscal 2018 and 2019. Our final key metric is closed sales",Positive
"As Rich noted earlier, we have reported record closed sales, and our pipeline remained strong",Positive
"So, to sum up, Broadridge reported strong third quarter results, with double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EPS, and closed sales, and remain on track to deliver our fiscal year 2017 guidance on key metrics of recurring fee revenue growth, adjusted EPS, and closed sales",Positive
"We expect spending on efficiency initiatives to increase in the fourth quarter, as we position the business for more growth",Positive
"And Connor (44:27), this is Jim",Neutral
"Again, it's a great success",Positive
We've built up a good set of deals in our revenue backlog,Positive
Unknown Speaker Sure,Neutral
Great,Neutral
"Sometimes, it's more formal, less formal",Neutral
"As Rich said, maybe a bit more intensity and formality around this",Neutral
"So, just sort of giving you a heads up that we could see a little bit of elevated expense in the fourth quarter for that, as part of laying our foundation for more growth",Positive
"Thanks, Lip-Bu and good afternoon everyone",Neutral
"Also, please note that the recurring revenue mix was approximately 90%; DSOs were 31 days, down six days from Q1 on strong collections",Positive
Our DSO target remains approximately 35 days,Neutral
"Functional verification revenue was down from last year, as overall hardware revenue was less than anticipated for the first half",Negative
"However, we expect hardware revenue to be a little stronger for the second half",Positive
Now let's turn to our outlook,Neutral
"dollar, primarily the Japanese yen",Neutral
"To conclude, we are pleased with our second quarter results, including strong financial performance, software and IP growth, and growing proliferation of our digital and sign-off solutions with market shaping customers",Positive
"Looking forward, we are excited about the new opportunities resulting from our system-design enablement strategy, and we are confident that we will continue to drive strong financial and operating results",Positive
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"And Farhan, this is John Wall here",Neutral
But just want to point out,Neutral
"So Q2 ended up being a very strong quarter for us, for collections",Positive
So we reiterated the cash flow guidance,Neutral
"And Krish, this is John here",Neutral
"I just want to add that, we have great products in the hardware space",Positive
"And note, that we delivered excellent financial results for Q2, software and IP were both strong, and we increased our outlook for the year",Positive
"Yeah Monika, this is John",Neutral
"But we are continuing to build on our innovation and take action to drive growth and deliver results for our customers, all of which should enable us to deliver value to shareholders",Positive
"Geoff, I don't know if you want to add anything?",Neutral
Yes,Neutral
"Thanks, Chuck",Neutral
"Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter with revenue of $11.6 billion, down 2%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, flat year-over-year",Negative
We continued to make progress on our strategic growth priorities while maintaining rigorous discipline on profitability and cash generation,Positive
"As part of our strategy to drive long-term profitable growth, we're prioritizing key investments, both organically and inorganically, such as the intended acquisition of AppDynamics",Positive
Let me provide some more details on our revenue breakdown,Negative
Total product revenue was down 4% and let me walk through each of the product areas,Negative
"Routing was down 10%, although we did see growth in orders",Positive
We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue growing 14%,Positive
"Data center declined 4%, impacted by the continued market shift from blade to rack, though last week we announced expansion of our UCS portfolio by offering the Microsoft Azure stack on UCS via an integrated validated system that enabled organizations to deliver Microsoft Azure services from their on-premise data centers",Negative
"Security grew 14% with deferred revenue growth of 45%, as we offer more solutions to customers with increasing software content that result in greater recurring revenue",Positive
We had very strong performance in our advanced threat security of 65% as well as strength in unified threat management and web security solutions,Positive
"Services continues to execute well, growing 5% with a strong focus on renewals and attach rates",Positive
"Overall, we drove 13% growth in total deferred revenue with product up 19% and services up 9%",Positive
"We made good progress on increasing our recurring revenue, with 31% of our total Q2 revenue generated from recurring offers, up from 28% a year ago",Positive
"In terms of orders, total product orders growth was flat with book-to-bill greater than 1. Let's take a look at our geographies, which is a primary way we run the business",Positive
EMEA was down 4% and APJC was down 5%,Neutral
"In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 1%, commercial grew 3%, public was down 6%, public sector was down 6% and service provider declined 1%",Negative
"From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.1%, down slightly by 0.1 points",Negative
"Our product gross margin was 62.4%, down 0.9 points and service gross margin was 68.8%, growing 2.1 points",Negative
The guidance for the third quarter is as follows,Neutral
"certainly, and in commercial and enterprise",Neutral
and Europe and Asia,Neutral
So we're in that 1.5% to 2% range,Neutral
"Well again, as we continue to accelerate the growth, as we're continuing to grow it like we have been growing it, I referred it may get even more until it evens out, but in the last few quarters it has been in that range",Positive
"Yeah, we don't share gross margins by business unit, but I can tell you, the margins are growing in our security portfolio overall between the mix of the growth in these areas and the acquisitions and the SaaS businesses we've been adding",Positive
So it's very accretive to the Cisco average,Neutral
"Hi, Vijay",Neutral
"Yeah, that's a great question, Steve",Neutral
"So actually product as a percentage of my total product revenue, it's up to 10% now this quarter for the first time, so we're happy about that",Positive
So we're trying to find ways to find other offers,Neutral
"It's a great new innovation and extension of TelePresence, but it's a great example of where we're selling that",Positive
We used to sell it always as a system,Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
So that's why we're so focused on it,Neutral
"I'll take that one, and a great question",Neutral
"So we had, if you go back a year ago, SP video in Asia was extremely strong because of that",Positive
That program has dramatically slowed down,Neutral
So that's hurting us quite a bit as well,Neutral
So in the normal ranges,Neutral
But really it's those two specific things,Neutral
"And I will say that I do anticipate those two headwinds to remain there next quarter as well as we had very strong SP video, that China program, in Q3 as well",Positive
I'll start on the supplier component issue,Neutral
"So yeah, those articles are out there",Neutral
This is very proactive,Neutral
"Sure, so yeah",Neutral
So that 51% growth is year-over-year growth of over $1.3 billion and everything's growing in that space,Positive
And they're all growing huge double digits,Neutral
Everything is up massively to drive to that 51%,Neutral
"Yeah, wireless being Meraki, yes",Neutral
Not as of right now,Neutral
"Thank you, Marilyn, and, good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
"In Q1 we delivered a solid quarter with revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. We are seeing great traction with our new intent-based networking solutions, delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio and offering a broader range of new consumption options to our customers, resulting in strong increases in our software and subscription revenue",Positive
"The progress we've made resulted in all three of our geographic regions returning to orders growth during Q1. Cisco has always been about connecting people, information and machines at scale",Positive
"First, let's start with Infrastructure Platforms",Neutral
Our launch of The Network,Neutral
Intuitive,Neutral
Now turning to applications,Neutral
Moving to Security,Neutral
"This differentiated strategy drove the 8% revenue growth in our Security portfolio, and we also saw continued momentum in our Security deferred revenue, with 42% growth",Positive
I firmly believe that Cisco is well positioned to capture long-term growth opportunities ahead,Positive
"Yes, Mark",Neutral
Thanks for the question,Neutral
"So clearly, we're pleased with where we're going right now with this product portfolio",Positive
We're pleased with the early feedback,Neutral
It's still one quarter,Neutral
"Well, thanks, Steve",Neutral
We needed to drive new innovation,Neutral
"So, Vijay, thanks for the question",Neutral
"It's our first insertion there, and actually it was before the large sales day that they experienced I think last week",Neutral
We're in discussions with all of them,Neutral
We have made announcements with several of them,Neutral
There's two facets,Neutral
"Kelly, do you want to",Neutral
I'd say couple of quarters ago it began to exceed what I was expecting so I changed my expectations and it's â€“ but they're doing a great job,Positive
The teams are doing well,Neutral
So we're very pleased with that,Neutral
"And I think that after we acquired Viptela, we have now â€“ at our sales meeting we provided tremendous clarity to our sales organization and our partner community at the Partner Summit about what our strategy is",Neutral
"So, again, happy with where we are relative to the positioning of the different platforms",Positive
Yes,Neutral
"So, Tal, thanks for the question",Neutral
Let me break it down,Neutral
"Thanks, Mitch",Neutral
They've got their branch networks,Neutral
"And, Kelly, any comments on the",Neutral
"Kelly, do you want to take",Neutral
"So, I'm sorry that was Simon",Neutral
In the enterprise switching?,Neutral
"So, thanks for the question, Jeff",Neutral
I think that the intuitive network [The Network,Neutral
"And where we compete with competitors who their value prop is up front cost of the hardware, I think we're changing the discussion, because if you look at the cost of operating this infrastructure over a five-year period, it's probably 10X the cost of the upfront hardware",Neutral
"Yes, Erik, thanks for that",Neutral
"In our commercial business, we saw 12% growth on a global basis and it was double digits in every geography, which is always good to see",Positive
as well as this whole SD-WAN discussion,Neutral
"Well, that's it, isn't it?",Neutral
I'll wrap it,Neutral
"Thanks, everyone again for joining us today",Neutral
I just want to wrap with a few points,Neutral
And we are laser focused on five key elements of that strategy to enable our customers' success and drive profitable growth for us and shareholder value as well,Positive
"Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you",Neutral
"Thank you, Mark, and welcome to everyone",Neutral
"As you can see, the business results are strong",Neutral
The faster-than-expected shift is a strong indicator of our customers' belief in our long-term vision,Positive
It's now our job to be more intentional about the transformation needed in all areas of the business to drive solid growth and profitability into the future,Positive
"Looking at our products, I believe we currently have the strongest product portfolio and roadmap that I've seen in my tenure with the company",Positive
"So to sum it all up, business is strong",Neutral
Thank you very much,Neutral
"And as always, we look forward to your questions",Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
The quickest way to answer that is just look at the mix from Q2. Just about 85% of the mix was coming from new customers or maybe existing customers with new use cases,Neutral
"In fact, it's stronger than it has been in many, many, many years now",Positive
"We've got two great leaders running both product and engineering, and we've recently gone through a unification from an org model standpoint to bring together all of our product and engineering efforts",Positive
We're releasing a number of new capabilities,Neutral
"Overall, I think it's going quite well",Neutral
We had a couple of promotions going,Neutral
We feel very good about it,Neutral
"Sure, Kash",Neutral
"First off, thank you",Neutral
I appreciate the support,Neutral
So a lot of work to do,Neutral
We'll talk about it on the quarter,Neutral
We see a lot of opportunities,Neutral
"If you think about some of the transitions we've already started making in the last few months around reorganizing the engineering team, the product teams and all these others",Neutral
So I'd say stay tuned,Neutral
Give us three months to finish out this plan,Neutral
"Overall, we're excited about where we can go and we think there's opportunities both to accelerate revenue and deliver leverage expansion over the next three years",Neutral
We were running hot in the first half of the year,Neutral
"So again, I'd say stay tuned",Neutral
"The core takeaway is that business has been very strong, but the subscription mix is moving faster than we anticipated, more than double the pace that we were expecting a year ago",Positive
"Sure, Michael",Neutral
"So if you think about our kind of three main markets, service providers attached to other Citrix solutions and what I would call pure-play ADC, the pure play was up strong double digits in the quarter so we're actually being able to engage and win in a much greater number of competitive transactions",Positive
We're not relying on a rip-and-replace hardware cycle for growth at this point in time,Positive
Billings growth was 8.5%,Positive
We did have double-digit bookings growth across all three of our main businesses so the underlying trends have been positive,Positive
It does tend to be more back-end loaded,Neutral
"So I don't know the exact number off the top of my head, but roughly it would be 60%, maybe as much as 65% of the renewal pool would come up in the Q3, Q4 timeframe",Neutral
"But, overall, I'd say if you look at the field organization, and the big takeaway is that we're executing now internationally whereas we had been driving a lot of the growth domestically over the last couple of years",Positive
"back in the 2013, 2014, 2015 timeframe",Neutral
We started that work later in the international markets and now they're delivering significant growth,Positive
"No, it's the latter, Kirk",Neutral
So we have the ability to moderate expense growth and do that in a way that expense growth looks more close to revenue growth,Positive
"That number has started to accelerate over the last couple of quarters and I would expect that as we go into the back half of the year, we'll exit north of 40% growth in SaaS revenue for Q4 as well",Positive
"Yeah, unit growth was strong",Positive
It was low double-digit unit growth,Positive
We do tend to be the higher priced competitor,Neutral
"So in the aggregate, not a big shift",Neutral
We are not going to win on price,Neutral
It's not a long-term strategy,Neutral
"Well, thank you again for joining us today",Neutral
We hope that everyone is excited as we are for the next great chapter in Citrix's transformation,Positive
I'd say we're moving quickly,Neutral
Thanks again,Neutral
Talk to you in three months,Neutral
"Thanks, Frank",Neutral
"Second quarter revenues were up 4.1% year over year, driven mostly by our growth in insurance",Positive
"In insurance, we're seeing broad-based growth across clients and strong demand for multi-service line managed service deals",Positive
This is being partly offset by continued strong growth in our mid-tier accounts,Positive
Today they make up over a third of our total company's revenue and are meaningful contributors to our growth and our portfolio diversification,Positive
Products and Resources grew 13.2% year over year as a result of continued strong performance with our manufacturing and logistics clients,Positive
"Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter of broad-based growth, up 16.8% year over year",Positive
"To close out our geographic discussion, we had continued strong growth in the rest of the world, which was up 21.2% year over year",Positive
This growth was driven by key Asia-Pacific markets such as India and Australia,Positive
"And just as we have done in continental Europe, we're building a strong local presence and investing both organically and inorganically in these emerging markets",Positive
I'd like to add a few points to this discussion,Neutral
"Hey, Brian, this is Raj",Neutral
"Hi, Jim",Neutral
This is Raj,Neutral
"So look, I think the overall financial services, I think if we look at the entire practice, obviously insurance continued doing well",Neutral
"And as we talked about, regional banks are healthy, strong growth",Positive
And I think we're well positioned,Neutral
"And so that's obviously areas that we're investing in, and we're hopeful for future growth as they get healthier",Positive
"I have nothing to add to that, Joe",Neutral
Now that's a longer-term trend,Neutral
Cognizant delivered solid third quarter results,Neutral
Three of our four business segments were strong contributors to our performance,Positive
"Healthcare, product and resources and communications and media and technology averaged double digit growth rates",Positive
Our third quarter digital related revenue grew well above company average,Positive
"For 2017, we delivered three consecutive quarters of strong execution at the top and bottom lines",Positive
This consistent performance underscores the soundness of our strategy and investments and the continuing strong demand for our portfolio of services,Positive
"For a leading financial institution facing slowing growth in a major business, Cognizant developed an artificial intelligence enabled robotic investment advisor that would appeal to a new market of approximately 90 million millennials and that will enable the firm to achieve its goal of doubling retail assets under management by 2020. To envision and build this digital solution, we brought a cross-functional team from the client together with Cognizant digital business designers, strategists, technologists and financial services experts",Positive
But strong digital skills alone are not enough,Neutral
I'll talk a little bit about the overall plan,Neutral
I think about the transition or the shift to digital in two pieces that sort of the services that we offer to clients,Neutral
And I think we continue to make great progress there,Positive
"I'll let Karen comment on the overall digital revenue, it grew again double digit - at a double digit pace much ahead company average this quarter",Positive
And we feel good about the transition of the service mix to digital,Neutral
I think it's also important that just to note that as we've said before that today our portfolio if you look at the entire portfolio of digital revenue it is running at a higher margin than the rest of the business,Neutral
So overall just a very healthy mix shift going on and I think that that will continue to unfold through 2018 and beyond,Neutral
"Having said that, Moshe it's Frank, I think it's worth adding one additional piece of color for you which is that, Karen mentioned that last quarter digital revenue as a percent of total company revenue was about 26%",Neutral
So I don't think by any stretch that we are not a significant player in financial - in the digital aspects of financial services as these big money center banks start to think about and start to execute on their digital plans,Neutral
"Again, I want to separate",Neutral
"So, yet there are deals that if they convert could be significant going down the road, but we are already - the point I was making, Moshe, is that today digital is already and financial services is roughly in line with our company average",Negative
"So think about the 26% number, we're right around there in financial services",Neutral
"As the healthcare market changes and evolves we have just sort of a very strong end to end portfolio of service offerings whether that's consulting to help our clients figure out what they need to do to respond to the changes, whether that's operating in terms of our BPaaS offerings and our ability to run core parts of the operation for our client or whether that's on the technology front as they think about modernizing and digitizing their technology backbone",Positive
"So as these changes come to healthcare given that we have such a strong portfolio of assets both software assets, intellectual property in the form of our people and capabilities",Positive
"It's Frank, let me take that",Neutral
And so that's broad plan,Neutral
"So we'll run them relatively independently, let them continue to do the great work that they've been doing for their clients",Positive
We think there maybe some opportunity to cross-sell our traditional services into their clients and we'll continue to execute on that going forward,Neutral
"By combining sort of our services and software capabilities increasingly together, we're creating these - think of them as solution offerings capabilities that we take to the market",Neutral
"Well, thanks very much",Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
"Thank you, Wendell and good morning",Neutral
"As we noted in today's release, our fourth quarter core results reflect the sequential and year-over-year improvement we expected and we're very pleased with our strong operating performance",Positive
"Looking ahead, we see year-over-year growth in the first quarter in sales, net income and EPS",Positive
These proceeds offset much of the yen-related decline in display's earnings,Negative
"Turning to fourth quarter core results, sales grew 6% year over year and net income was $534 million, up 24% year-over-year",Positive
"Adjusting for the former Dow Corning silicones business equity earnings which no longer contribute to our results, net income grew 36% year over year",Positive
"Fourth quarter EPS was $0.50, up 47%",Neutral
These positive year-over-year results were primarily due to rapid adoption of Gorilla Glass 5 and record Gorilla Glass volume which produced higher sales and a profit boost from its premium price; sales growth and higher profitability in optical communications; and LCD glass volume growth and moderate pricing,Positive
"Total gross equity earnings were $112 million, driven primarily by our equity earnings from Hemlock which is seasonally strongest in Q4. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17%",Positive
The fourth quarter display market and our results were strong and in line with guidance,Positive
The fourth quarter is the strongest season at retail,Positive
"Based on preliminary data, premium retail area growth year over year was robust, particularly in North America and China",Positive
"Sequentially, our volume was down slightly",Neutral
"As we predicted, growth was driven primarily by average TV screen size which grew more than 1.5 inches",Positive
Let me walk you through the details,Neutral
This has a small contribution to glass market area growth,Positive
"This will contribute 4% to 5% to end market glass area growth in 2017. Third, we think IT will be flat, with larger screen sizes offset by lower units",Neutral
We do not expect IT and other smaller form factors to contribute to glass market growth,Positive
"And fourth, the value chain enters the year with healthy inventory levels and we think inventory will again be healthy at year-end 2017, expanding during the first half to prepare for a seasonally-strong second half, when inventory will contract",Positive
"This is down mid-single digits sequentially, driven by two fewer production days in the quarter and a reduction in panel maker capacity",Negative
"We believe the full-year 2017 glass price declines will be more moderate than 2016. In fact, we may see the smallest declines in the last five years, as the profitability of our competitors remains low and supply/demand remains in balance",Negative
"Let's move to optical communications, where we're very pleased with the results, as fourth quarter sales rose 11% and NPAT rose 85% over last year",Positive
"North America carrier network business provided the fourth quarter growth highlight, as demand for our fiber-to-the-home solutions remained strong",Positive
"Turning to 2017, we're preparing to leverage the strong opportunities we see within the existing telecom market",Positive
"These include fiber market demand exceeding market supply; key industry leaders in telecom investing in optical solutions, particularly as they look to the next generations of network capabilities; and, finally, industry consolidations that favor some of our strong business partners",Positive
"As a result, we expect low teens growth for full-year 2017 sales",Positive
"The increase will largely be the result of a continuation of the growth trends we saw in the second half of 2016. In the first quarter, we expect year-over-year growth of at least 25%",Positive
"As a reminder, a software implementation issue constrained sales in the first half of 2016. In environmental, fourth quarter sales were down slightly, in line with our expectations",Negative
"The heavy duty diesel market is in a different place, particularly in North America, where truck builds were down 30% year on year and our sales were down",Negative
"For the first quarter, we expect to report sales consistent to down slightly versus Q1 of last year",Negative
"For 2017 overall, we expect full-year sales to be consistent to up slightly from 2016. We expect continued sales growth in the auto market and lower heavy duty volume",Positive
Net income was up 48% year over year,Neutral
We began to feel the benefit of Gorilla Glass 5 pricing in the fourth quarter and expect it to positively impact our financial performance in 2017. Our growth prospects remain strong in this market,Positive
We're highly confident that our specialty materials business will grow in 2017. The only question is how big that growth will be which will depend on the timing and extent of customers employing Gorilla Glass 5 and other Corning innovations,Positive
"In Life Sciences, fourth quarter sales were up year over year and net income growth outpaced that of sales",Positive
"For full-year 2017 and the first quarter, we expect low single-digit growth year over year, ahead of forecasted market growth rates",Positive
"As Wendell noted, for the first quarter, we expect year-over-year growth in sales, net income and EPS",Positive
Recall from our strategy and capital allocation framework that we plan on investing $10 billion from 2016 to 2019 in growth and sustained leadership which included capital spending,Positive
We anticipate investing a total of about $1.5 billion in 2017 which is up from 2016. This is driven by expansions related to four growth opportunities in our market access platforms,Positive
"First, to support the double-digit growth of optical communications",Positive
"Let me close by saying that we're very pleased with the strong fourth quarter results and our positive momentum coming into 2017. Overall, we feel very good about our progress against our framework and the rich set of opportunities ahead of us",Positive
"With that, let's move to Q&A",Neutral
Let me start on the optical question,Neutral
We definitely had good growth in the fourth quarter,Positive
It was higher than what we expected,Neutral
"But over time, we definitely expect this to be a strong driver of growth",Positive
"And as we look out into next year, for our full year, we think our growth will be in the mid-teens",Neutral
"But we do expect some growth in the hyperscale data -- enterprise in general, including hyperscale data centers",Positive
"Now, for the first quarter, we said the growth would be greater than 25%",Positive
"I think you can think about that, roughly half of that coming from the issues we had last year and half of it being the strong market that we have",Positive
"Because overall, we think the market in the mid-teens gives you a sense that -- our growth in the mid-teens gives you the sense that the market, we expect to grow greater than 10%",Neutral
I think that right now fiber supply is very tight,Neutral
"Why don't I start with the telecom question, Rod",Neutral
"I think from an overall standpoint, we did see the growth in the fourth quarter and that was on a year-over-year basis, also versus Q3. But I think one thing that we learned in the process of talking about hyperscale growth is, because of the lumpy nature of it and the timing",Neutral
I think it's more important to think about it on an annual basis and it's part of our mid-teens or low teens growth that we expect in 2017.,Neutral
"We agree, I think, IT is stronger than it has been over the last couple of years",Positive
So we just don't see it as a big contributor,Neutral
"Of course, we could be wrong about that",Neutral
"Clearly, Gorilla Glass 5 adoption was strong in the fourth quarter",Positive
"I'm not going to give you the percentage of what it was, but it was strong in the fourth quarter and we expect it to continue to accelerate as we go into 2017 and that's positive, both in terms of the volume itself and of the premium price",Positive
And that premium price clearly had a positive impact on our profitability in Q4. And it will continue to have an impact on our profitability in 2017.,Positive
Sure,Neutral
"I think on the overall growth standpoint, it's always hard for us to know exactly the impact of the software implementation issue that we had",Neutral
"But I think if you were to adjust for that, you would still see growth in the double digits",Neutral
The bottom line here is that we think that our position in this market and where we play in this market and the part of the market that is most important to us is growing very rapidly and we think it's seen a double-digit growth,Neutral
"In terms to fiber-to-the-home, clearly North America is a place where we see lots of fiber to the home growth",Positive
And I'm also not going to disclose how much it is,Neutral
So the answer to your second question is correct,Neutral
That is the way that we expect it to play out,Neutral
"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
I was very pleased with F5 teamâ€™s performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2017. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 5% the strong profitability and operating margins,Positive
"The highlight of the quarter was a return to product revenue growth, which will remain our number one financial clarity throughout fiscal 2017. We continue to make good progress on sales execution fueled by the vast array of new products that we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Product sales in our Americas region continue to improve with another quarter of year-over-year sales product growth",Positive
Software revenues were very solid in fiscal Q1 driven by strong growth in virtualization software sales and strong growth insured security solutions,Positive
"If we maintain our current growth momentum, we should exit fiscal 2017 on a $400 million annual trajectory for software sales",Positive
These trends resulted in double-digit year-over-year Q1 growth rates within our security product portfolio,Positive
Once again our services business delivered strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 8.5%,Positive
"As Andy mentioned, we are seeing as expected slowing year-over-year services revenue growth related to the slower product sales in FY 2016. We expect our services revenue growth trends to begin to normalize in the second half of the year as product revenue continues to grow",Positive
The Herculon SSL Orchestrator provides improved insight for customers experiencing growth in the volume of encrypted application data,Positive
"I believe we are poised to see increased growth in year-over-year product revenue in Q2 and we have every opportunity to build in that momentum for the second half of fiscal 2017. In conclusion, Iâ€™d like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners, and customers for their support last quarter, and with that weâ€™ll now hand the call over for Q&A",Positive
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"On the first one, on service provider, actually I felt really good about service provider last quarter, especially in Americas",Positive
"EMEA did have a tough-ish quarter in service provider and that went hand-in-hand, quite frankly, with the overall toughness weâ€™ve seen, but I was pretty happy with the results",Positive
"In terms of the product refresh, I think I caught the question, but if I didnâ€™t, Andy, excuse me, will correct me",Neutral
This is looking very good for that to happen,Neutral
"As we said in the script, weâ€™re very, very happy with the way that â€“ the reception from customers, A, from the ones that we announced towards the end of Q4, and then for the ones that we announced at the end of Q1. We even saw quite a strong pickup towards the end of December across the board, and I know that the field are quite excited about it",Positive
Yes,Neutral
"Let me go with the software, first of all",Neutral
"So, I think weâ€™ve sometimes said 78%",Neutral
"Linearity, yes",Neutral
The linearity last quarter was interesting,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
So we havenâ€™t kind of past so,Neutral
"And then the other things Julian, asking about Silverline, I think you missed in this script was, weâ€™re very much using Silverline as a competitive advantage, just against cloud based solutions and other service solution",Neutral
"It still equates more, but growing I mean I could give you a very big growth number, but that would be, it quite still equates more",Positive
"And I think what we said and we suppose taking to this is as I guess bigger the Fed revenue in particular from a subscription point of view, weâ€™ll start talking about it",Neutral
"So weâ€™ll see, but so far, so good",Neutral
"Typically, I might be wrong",Neutral
Yes,Neutral
So you see four quarter,Neutral
Thanks,Neutral
"Obviously, we mentioned services, and until we start to see the product growth coming back â€“ there the main areas, but no â€“ in terms of looking alone at the product stream, when I look at what Iâ€™m very happy about, itâ€™s software sales, the VE sales, the cloud sales starting to rise with Amazon and Azure",Positive
Thank you,Neutral
Itâ€™s going to be in container architecture,Neutral
"I did mention that we saw a little bit of a lull, which could have been linked to the iSeries announcement, and then we saw a strong close at the quarter and some of that can be budget flush, but I wouldnâ€™t say it was â€“ it wasnâ€™t incredibly significant",Positive
"And then, the second question?",Neutral
Okay,Neutral
"In fact, I talked about double-digit growth, so we felt very, very good about that",Positive
"I mean, one of the things that has been becoming very obvious, too, is when our customers â€“ remember, we have a very, very large Fortune 500 customer base â€“ when our customers are doing lifts and shifts to the public cloud, whether Azure, whether itâ€™s Amazon, et cetera, that almost 100% of the time our products are going with that and that product being, it could be classic TMOS with programmability and iRules already included",Neutral
"It is, and itâ€™s usually September where we have a very strong , I mean, what weâ€™d say is weâ€™re very, very happy with the sales execution over the last couple of years in federal",Positive
"So we expect it to be strong, but this is far too early",Positive
"Thank you, FranÃ§ois",Neutral
"F5 delivered revenue of $518.2 million in fiscal Q2, reflecting year-over-year revenue growth of 7%",Positive
The majority of this growth came from sales strength in the U.S,Positive
", highlighted by strong enterprise and service provider sales, offset by continued weakness in EMEA and lower-than-expected services revenue",Positive
"We were particularly pleased to see product revenue growth accelerate to 7% year-over-year in Q2, up from 2% year-over-year growth in the prior quarter",Positive
"GAAP EPS was $1.43 per share for the quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.95. During Q2, we had a number of large wins that helped drive product revenue growth and reflect our continuing focus on opportunities in security and the cloud",Positive
"To cope with the explosive growth of traffic resulting from its unlimited data plans, a large U.S",Positive
"As part of its Cloud Edge strategy, a top U.S",Neutral
"Contributing to stronger product revenue growth, the entire family of new iSeries appliances was available for the entire quarter",Positive
"Customer response has been positive, and we continue to be happy with the uptick of the new platforms which was in line with prior appliance refresh cycles",Positive
Product revenue of $241.1 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 47% of total revenue,Positive
Service revenue of $277.2 million also grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 53% of total revenue,Positive
"While APAC contributed 15% of revenue, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16%",Positive
Federal,Neutral
And our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 33.4%,Neutral
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32%,Neutral
Turning to the balance sheet,Neutral
Cash flow from operations was $175.3 million,Neutral
DSO at the end of Q2 was 51 days,Neutral
Inventories were $32.5 million,Neutral
"The continued adoption of our iSeries products, accelerating sales of software solutions and F5's growing relevance in cloud environments, all serve as a foundation for continued product revenue growth",Positive
"While, we are pleased with the uptick the products introduced in the first half of the year and excited about the opportunities the continuing influx of new products represent, we feel that the ongoing uncertainty in EMEA merits prudence as we approach our outlook for Q3. With this in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 is $520 million to $530 million",Positive
Our GAAP EPS target is $1.47 to $1.50 per share,Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"I'd be reluctant to quantify, but EMEA combined with the shortfall that we saw on services, which â€“ we had talked last quarter about services continuing to decline, but then through the year we'd see it shallow out and then start to grow again",Negative
Yeah,Neutral
"I'm not sure conservatism is the word I'd use on this, because I think we've been talking with the sales organization, evaluating the pipeline, looking at the business",Neutral
This really isn't a new dynamic for us,Neutral
"One thing we talk about a lot is the uptake in the product refresh, and I think at times we don't draw the conclusion we want you to draw when we make these comments, because we talk about â€“ in the first full quarter, we want to see roughly 25% and we see that increasing over four quarters to 80%",Neutral
So we did feel we saw some good wins this quarter and it did impact the product revenue growth that we saw,Neutral
But our $1 million plus size deals were actually pretty strong across the rest of the world,Positive
"And then, for cloud",Neutral
"I mean it definitely did, when it got to full steam, drive very solid revenue growth",Positive
And I think we'll see it play in there,Neutral
"And then really as we expand out 18 months to 24 months and if you look historically, that's when we've seen it be a real strong driver",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"Historically, we've looked look at that as an opportunity to derive top line growth",Positive
And I think we'll continue to do that and balance that trade-off of investment against higher gross margin,Neutral
I think we're right on track,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"And we have said pretty consistently over the last three or four years that we expect op margin with seasonality to pull back in Q1 and Q2, because it's important for us to not slow the machine down on our investing and head count to try to overly â€“ I'll use the term overly manage op margin",Negative
And this is Andy,Neutral
"And the one area that we came away feeling good about is, competitively we feel as strong as ever",Positive
And we think that's important to highlight,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"So I'll take the first part of that question, which is our view on growth and product",Positive
"But, broadly, we think we're going to be pushing hard on the top line and we think we have every opportunity with the drivers we have in place",Neutral
Our viewpoint is not that,Neutral
"I wouldn't comment on next year, up or down, but we believe we're a growth company",Positive
"At our scale, what does that mean? We'll see",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"FranÃ§ois highlighted that our security had strong growth year-over-year, continue to expect that from software",Positive
We're not guiding that,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
We think off of this new base we start to go to more normal growth rates again,Neutral
"I think they averaged over 7 years old and they did have strong attach rates to them, still renewal rates",Positive
So that's where we ended up,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
I would highlight surrounding this discussion that our deferred revenue was pretty strong in the quarter,Positive
No,Neutral
We didn't break that out,Neutral
"Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
"While we delivered year-over-year growth of 4% and strong profitability in the third quarter, our product revenue performance fell short of our expectations",Positive
"The reacceleration of product revenue growth remains our number one priority, and we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on this over the coming periods",Positive
"Customer adoption of our recently introduced products remains strong and our revenue is increasingly coming from more diverse sources, including Virtual Editions, public cloud solutions, and application security",Positive
"While we have already made significant progress on these fronts, we recognize the need to move even faster to ensure we provide our secure application services in the way customers demand now and in the future",Positive
We have taken a number of steps to ensure our resources are properly aligned to growth opportunities across territories and customer verticals,Positive
Our security solutions delivered solid growth in the third quarter,Positive
We saw additional purchases from a large U.S,Neutral
"During Q3, we completed a deal with a large U.S",Neutral
I believe these new environments and consumption models for application services will create a meaningful opportunity for growth in our market,Positive
"Julian joined F5 in 2000 when the company boasted just over 500 employees and became part of the executive team in 2001. Julian has been a driving force behind developing a world-class services organization that now stands at over 1,200 people and generated over $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016. Julian will remain actively involved in his day-to-day operations until his retirement, and we have begun the process of finding his successor",Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"Thank you, Jess",Neutral
"Look, I'll take the first one on product growth",Positive
"And typically, in the past, we've seen an acceleration in product growth once we are further into the cycle and iSeries represent a higher percentage of our sales",Positive
"We are tracking â€“ as you look at the percentage of our appliance sales that are represented by iSeries, we're actually tracking to prior growth cycles or prior product cycles",Positive
And that's part of what gives us the confidence that we can have product revenue growth in coming quarters,Positive
"We continue to see growth in our Virtual Edition offerings, both because of private cloud and now increasingly because of public cloud",Positive
"And as we get further into the cycle, our expectation is to continue to see product revenue growth",Positive
"Thank you, Brian",Neutral
"So, a couple of areas",Neutral
"As it relates to marginalization, to your point around do we feel F5 is being marginalized, I don't think so",Neutral
"For the customers that we have typically served and, typically, those customers have large and complex workloads, when they're moving to either private cloud environment or a combination of private cloud and public cloud, we are involved in the conversation, and we feel we have a very strong win rate and we have relevant offerings to support them",Positive
So I don't feel that there's any marginalization going on with our existing customer base,Neutral
"Brian, we're not guiding for next year",Neutral
But I would say we're pretty confident we will see product revenue growth in 2018.,Positive
"Thank you, Jim",Neutral
"And on those aspects, yes, we are taking actions",Neutral
"We believe that, in some cases, we have probably too many people in some geographies where there's not enough opportunity and not enough people and geographies where we see growth opportunity",Positive
It's not â€“ it doesn't happen overnight,Neutral
"We have a pretty strong process that goes bottoms-up against pretty much every geography and vertical, and we continue to be thorough about it",Positive
"Thank you, Jim",Neutral
Andy will take the second one,Neutral
On the non-U.S,Neutral
Our non-U.S,Neutral
I think if you look at how this cycle is tracking and we track that fairly closely in terms of what percentage of our total sales are with the new platform,Neutral
So it looks to be taking the same shape,Neutral
That's much less the case here,Neutral
So don't mistake the total number in quarter for a lack of activity around hiring folks on what we believe are some very exciting growth opportunities for the company,Positive
"Thank you, Troy",Neutral
"Thank you, Meta",Neutral
"So, the best bundle is actually the â€“ we're seeing higher demand for that, which you can translate into we're seeing a higher security attach rates to our solution, which we actually think is a very good growth driver",Neutral
"As it relates to partnership and acquisitions, look, our philosophy about this has been and frankly is going to be, we want to have very strong organic plans for addressing the high-growth opportunities in our market, which essentially revolve around the cloud and security",Positive
"No, it makes sense",Neutral
I understand the question,Neutral
"So, the reason we're saying it's tracking after prior cycle is really a key metric for iSeries is the adoption of the product in the customer base as in do our customers see good reasons to adopt this new platform and refresh their environment? And the best way for us to measure that is to look at the percentage of our total appliance sales that come from this new platform",Positive
"Now, to your second question, which was",Neutral
"Thank you, Andy",Neutral
"The only thing, Jeff, that I would add is, whilst we look at the refresh cycle as a growth opportunity for F5, I think we also want to be clear that that is not solely what we see as the medium to long term growth driver for the company",Neutral
"And I want to be very, very clear with that, that we see the number of applications being deployed in private and public cloud and specifically in virtual ADC market, we see that as a growth market",Positive
And that I see as a growth driver for the company,Positive
The other important growth driver is application-centric security,Positive
It is a bigger issue,Neutral
We're seeing strong demand for that,Neutral
No,Neutral
Attrition are in line with historical levels,Neutral
"So, no, we're not seeing that",Neutral
Yes,Neutral
We're more of an application security player,Neutral
"Ryan, on the containers?",Neutral
"Thank you, Alex",Neutral
Good reflections,Neutral
And security is actually one of these domains,Neutral
"Our philosophy around this is that we have to have strong organic plans to do that and there's a number of things we're doing organically that we've started executing on that we'll be able to discuss at a later stage, not today",Positive
"If and when we see some good opportunities to extend that inorganically, as I said, we will not rule that out",Positive
We said that's our number one priority,Neutral
We do see product revenue growth next year and we've got a number of exciting organic propositions that we're executing on that we believe will contribute to that,Positive
"Thank you, Alex",Neutral
"Thanks, Gary",Neutral
"In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 4.8% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $846 million, a 15.2% increase compared to the prior year",Positive
"For the year, revenue increased 4.6% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $2.9 billion, an 11.1% increase compared to the prior-year period",Positive
"EBITDA margin expanded 220 basis points to 31.2%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% to $3.82 per share",Positive
"We finished the year marginally exceeding our run rate synergy goal of $200 million for 2016. Moving to slide 10. In the four quarter, IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 2.5%, while EBITDA grew 5%, primarily driven by a favorable shift in revenue mix, coupled with executing ongoing cost management initiatives",Positive
"Absent this, the IP-led product business grew approximately 3%",Positive
Payments grew 1.1% for the quarter,Neutral
"As we've discussed previously, EMV growth comparables will become more difficult in the second half of the year",Positive
We issued 7 million EMV cards in the quarter,Neutral
Corporate and digital produced growth of 12.5% for the quarter,Positive
This growth was driven primarily by strong sales for corporate liquidity and continued double-digit revenue growth in digital solutions,Positive
"In addition to the large contract Gary mentioned, our corporate liquidity solutions had strong license revenue, contributing to the growth",Positive
"As discussed in prior quarters, we did not expect IFS results in the second half of the year to replicate the exceptional growth in the first half of the year",Positive
"We are pleased with the organic growth of 5%, and profitability results for the year",Positive
"Turning to slide 12. In the fourth quarter, GFS revenue grew 7.7% organically while EBITDA grew 31.3%",Positive
"EBITDA grew 17.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting 380 basis points of margin expansion to 30.4%",Positive
"Moving to slide 13. Our Institutional and Wholesale business grew 8.7% for the quarter, driven by buy-side and risk and compliance solutions",Positive
Banking and Payments grew 2.5% organically,Positive
"Consulting results for the quarter were in line with our expectations of double-digit growth, primarily driven by easy comparables to the prior year quarter",Positive
"The transaction produced approximately $500 million of net cash proceeds, which was used to pay down debt",Negative
We are also providing guidance on IFS and GFS revenue growth in 2017. IFS will continue to serve our U.S,Positive
"GFS will continue to see strong growth in institutional and wholesale, and an improvement in our Banking and Payment Solutions",Positive
We expect single-digit growth for our consulting services for the full year,Positive
"For the full year, Corporate and Other segment, which houses our non-strategic assets, we created approximately 1% top line headwind to consolidated organic revenue growth",Positive
"This decline is primarily driven by a loss of the client, who was acquired in late 2016, continuing decline in check volumes at the point of sale, and loss attributed to the planned divestiture of the public and sector (sic) [sector and] (19:31) education revenue growth",Negative
"To be clear, organic growth is adjusted for the divestiture of PS&E, but the loss of higher growth from this business will be a headwind during the year",Positive
"Turning to slide 17. For 2017, we expect consolidated organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%, IFS organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, GFS organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%",Positive
"Consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.04 billion to $3.12 billion, implying reported growth of 3% to 6%, or 6% to 9% adjusting for the impact of the PS&E divestiture",Positive
"Adjusted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.30 per share representing growth of 9% to 13%, or 12% to 16% adjusted for the impact of the PS&E divestiture and does not include any share buybacks",Positive
"This 300 basis point reduction from the prior year period is driven by efficient tax planning strategies, growth in lower tax geographies, and the impact from changes in accounting treatment of stock-based compensation",Positive
We are confident in our guidance for the year and our ability to continue to drive value to our shareholders through compelling business model and strong cash flow generation,Positive
That concludes our prepared remarks,Neutral
"Operator, you now may open the line for questions",Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"Good morning, Dave",Neutral
"Yes, that sits in the Corporate and Other segment",Neutral
The impact to consolidated organic growth is about a point with a combination of that loss and declining check volumes in that segment,Positive
"Again, their growth being in line with what we talked about back in May",Positive
"Thanks, David",Neutral
"That's correct, Dave",Neutral
It overall is a drag on total company organic growth in that zone,Positive
"Yeah, a couple of things",Neutral
"It can continue to go down in the current environment, as we continue to work through tax planning strategies, and as our international revenue base continues to grow",Negative
"As we talked about in May, we really gave 3% to 7% organic revenue guide over the horizon, with 13% to 18% earnings per share growth",Positive
I would not anticipate changing that guide,Neutral
We do have an adjustment associated with PS&E,Neutral
But the individual earnings per share growth per year we think is very close to that,Neutral
"If you adjust out PS&E this year, you're in 12% to 16% underlying growth in the business",Positive
"Yeah, if you remember specifically, we tried to give you an implied number associate, but we're trying to give percentage growth over that horizon",Positive
"It will be difficult to get to that full $4.70 number, Ashwin, with the sale of PS&E, but we do anticipate in that 13% to 18% EPS growth",Positive
"The growth, we believe, will be in the 13% to 18% range for 2018.",Positive
"If you go into the tax rate, Brett, if you go back to May, we looked at the bridge of earnings growth over the next couple of years",Positive
The tax rate was a component of that,Neutral
"And to your comment with regard to revenue growth, we wanted to make sure we put together another conservative guide that we felt very comfortable being able to meet or exceed",Positive
We don't have a specific one,Neutral
We've got some tailwinds specifically this year in EMV and the people-based project,Positive
"You've got accelerated EMV growth in first quarter of 2016 that will be a difficult grow over in 2017, and we had a large license renewal in the I&W, the Institutional and Wholesale Group, and global trading that will not recur in the first quarter",Positive
I want to make sure we've got it clear,Neutral
I'm glad you asked the question to clarify,Neutral
"Again, you have got three moving parts",Neutral
We still expect that to be a decliner over time,Neutral
"I'll begin on slide 10. In the second quarter, revenue increased to $2.3 billion, or 2.3% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew to $746 million, a 7.2% increase compared to the prior-year quarter",Positive
"For the first half of the year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew to $1.4 billion, a 7.1% increase compared to the prior-year period",Positive
Adjusted earnings per share grew 11.2% to $1.88 per share,Positive
"Consistent with last quarter, a detailed bridge of revenue growth from GAAP to organic is included in the appendix material",Positive
"Moving to slide 11. In the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 2.6% to $1.2 billion",Positive
"For the first half of the year, revenue increased 2.1% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $911 million, a 4.6% increase compared to the prior year period",Positive
"Payments grew 1.1% for the quarter, reflecting difficult EMV card production comparables that we have previously discussed",Positive
"Turning to slide 13, in the second quarter, Global Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 3.9% to $1.1 billion",Positive
"Adjusted EBITDA grew to $614 million, a 14.2% increase compared to the prior-year period",Positive
We remain confident in our second-half growth expectations for this business,Positive
"Moving to slide 15, the revenue from our non-strategic assets in Corporate and Other declined 17.8% on an organic basis, consistent with our previous guidance",Negative
"Corporate expenses were $75 million, a 4.5% decline from the prior year, driven by continued focus on cost management initiatives",Negative
"Turning to slide 18, for 2017, we are reiterating our organic revenue growth rates and revising consolidated and segment revenue dollar ranges due to the divestiture",Positive
"Full-year consolidated organic revenue growth is expected to be 2% to 3%, resulting in a range of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion",Positive
"IFS organic revenue growth is expected to be 3% to 4%, resulting in a range of $4.62 billion to $4.67 billion",Positive
"And GFS organic revenue growth is expected to be 4% to 5%, resulting in a range of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion",Positive
"Despite our relatively slow start to the year on a top-line basis, which we expected, we remain confident in the full-year growth rates we provided at the beginning of the year and the underlying strength of the core operating segments",Positive
The net impact to full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance is an increase to $4.22 to $4.32 per share or 10% to 13% growth compared to prior-year period,Positive
"Adjusted for the timing of the consulting and public sector divestitures, and the refinancing activity this summer, normalized EPS growth would be approximately 10% in the third quarter",Positive
"We continue to focus on consistently improving cash flow generation, deleveraging our balance sheet, investing for growth, and returning cash to shareholders",Positive
That concludes our prepared remarks,Neutral
"Operator, you may now open the line for questions",Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"Morning, David",Neutral
I'll start and let Gary add some color,Neutral
"Thanks, Dave",Neutral
"Yeah, I'll hit your FX first",Neutral
"With regard to FX, you're right",Neutral
We had a very minor impact in the second quarter,Neutral
Neither one of those would impact organic growth in the way we calculate it,Positive
"Darrin, with regard to your first one, we've done some calcs, and we tried to give some color in the prepared remarks around what organic growth would look without the consulting business",Positive
"We haven't pulled out what the impact of, specifically, of the risk-based project and some of the compares are, particularly on the EMV, because that's just ordinary business, difficult compares, and we've got to grow through it",Negative
"But it'll certainly help both IFS and, we believe, GFS for full year in terms of organic growth",Positive
So it'll definitely help organic revenue growth,Positive
"As you know, we were looking at about a 1 point consolidated headwind from Corporate and Other, but feel very good about the strategic segments, about the growth rates we outline, and about where they can go long-term in those sustained rates we mentioned back in May of 2016.",Neutral
"Thanks, Darrin",Neutral
"Thanks, Brett",Neutral
Those are the two biggest chunks,Neutral
"Thanks, George",Neutral
The second would be around the discussion point around the revenue growth profile and what it looks like,Positive
"So, ultimately, we think it'll flow",Neutral
It'll flow like that,Neutral
"in those lowers rate jurisdictions, we'll continue to see a lower relative tax rate than maybe some others in the business",Neutral
But 30% to 31% is a pretty low effective tax rate,Neutral
That's the biggest issue,Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
"And ultimately, that drives better cash flows",Neutral
"So we're not updating our guide around that, feel good about the 105% to 115%, but certainly anticipate EBITDA margins to continue to improve",Neutral
It's probably in the $0.05 range,Neutral
"Upfront here, I'll plan to cover two subjects",Neutral
"So, on to the quarter",Neutral
That's back-to-back quarters of profit growth above 25%,Positive
The macro overall was a nonfactor in our Q2 earnings,Neutral
"Organic growth 9%, in Q2 with Fuel Card revenue growth of 8%",Positive
revenue growth in our other four major product lines was double-digit; that excludes our All Other category,Positive
"Q2 sales grew 7% versus prior year, with two of our smaller international markets, Mexico and Russia, grew sales a 100% versus last year",Positive
"It grew 14% on a pro forma basis, again 9% organic growth, about $40 million flowed through into earnings",Positive
"Fortunately, the U.S",Neutral
"But look, all in all a good solid quarter, good profit growth, and really kind of a good first half of 2017. Okay, let me transition over to the outlook for the rest of the year",Positive
So obviously that trade should result in faster revenue growth next year,Positive
"Our second half organic growth overall should pencil out at around 8% or 9%, with slower fuel card growth in the second half, again due to that bumpy MasterCard conversion",Positive
And that raise was oversubscribed,Neutral
"So, happy to continue to grow that program with them",Positive
"Cambridge is out looking 20% plus revenue growth in calendar 2017. You may have seen the SVS announcement, we have decided mutually with First Data to terminate our gift card JV",Positive
We're in the process now of reworking our growth plan for SVS and we'll revert with those thoughts and ideas later this year,Positive
"Low teens revenue growth in the first half, many of our transformational initiatives now taking hold, some pricing, lower credit losses, traction on some new sales channels, and testing of a new revamped IT system",Positive
"This is good, it's â€“ it helps in terms of processing speeds, it'll lower our IT costs going forward and it gives us better disaster recovery if we should ever need it",Positive
"So, look, in conclusion again a good Q2, good growth, 26% profit growth, back-to-back quarters of 25%-plus profit growth",Positive
"Our second half outlook is up sequentially, expecting 20% profit growth for full-year 2017. We're rebalancing the portfolio to faster growth businesses; NexTraq out, Cambridge in; we're strengthening our capital base, returning capital to shareholders, still increasing our liquidity and still maintaining a less-than-three-times leverage ratio",Positive
"So net-net we feel pretty well positioned to finish the rest of 2017 strong and take some of that momentum into 2018. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric",Positive
Eric?,Neutral
"Yeah, Ramsey",Neutral
"So the short answer is, it's just more term",Neutral
"They're happy, we're happy, so they added more term to the existing deal",Positive
Thanks,Neutral
"Hey, David",Neutral
"Yeah, I don't have it handy",Neutral
"I think the combination of all of those was plus 17%, the happy stuff that didn't convert and the sad stuff that converted, I think the consolidated number was 17%",Positive
I think it was a point or point and half negative,Neutral
So it's not one thing,Neutral
"Let me look; I've got the sales number, I think, handy here",Neutral
Always a pleasure,Neutral
"2% to 3%, Ashish, in Q2.",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"We're going to go back basically and dust off some of the other options and dust off his three-year growth plan, which we reviewed a bit ago, and come back to you guys, probably next call, with some clearer view of what we're going to do",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"I mean, the business is performing great, sales in that line of business were up 35% in the quarter, and I think we told you they were up 50% the prior year, over the first year",Neutral
"So, the sales are good, and that conversion time is about 12 months to 18 months, so it's relatively easy for us to plan what the second half of next year is going to look like, because we fundamentally have sold virtually all the business as of today that will hit revenue in the second half and in 2018. And so, again, that business is trending, I think, 14% â€“ 13%, 14%, 15% this quarter, it'll step-up a bit, so it's great",Neutral
"And then obviously on top of that we have the Cambridge thing that we expect to close this month, and that gives us some great cross-sale opportunity, some ripe accounts to deliver those same domestic AB (45:25) products into",Positive
So we've grown to like that business a lot,Neutral
"So that's one of the places that same-store sales are still quite soft, which is bringing the tran count down",Negative
"But again, we don't â€“ today the company doesn't get paid very much from that group, so it's not as big an impact on revenue",Negative
Yeah,Neutral
"Our â€“ we keep track of both credit losses in total and fraud as a piece of our credit losses, and fraud has declined 2016 over 2015, and this year year-to-date versus the per year",Negative
So our fraud is down,Neutral
"So I'd say that we've worked that pretty hard, and year-to-date, I think our total fraud losses are in the $4 million, $5 million range, so it seems pretty low",Neutral
I have it â€“ I have it here in front of me,Neutral
"Hey, Tien-Tsin",Neutral
"I'd say in our forecast, we reported 7% global sales growth over the prior year",Positive
"So I would assume that that will rebound, will be double-digit growth of sales in the second half",Positive
"And we haven't done all the math yet, there will be some flow-through from this one-time attrition, so one portfolio, which I think, Eric, was 3% to 4% of the global company was the file we converted? So, anyway whatever that one-time loss is, we'll see some of that trickle into Q3 and Q4, that 91.5%",Neutral
"But again, that's in our â€“ kind of in the numbers, which I don't want to make this a depressing call talking about IT, but just to remind everybody, it clearly suggests rest of world, rest of three quarters, doing good to be able to continue to kind of beat what we set out and beat the profit number",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"But with as many different places and things we're in, and I can't say that we have a great forward view of it",Positive
Thanks Jim,Neutral
Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $465 million a 15% increase compared to the third quarter of 2016 and as Jim mentioned an 8% organic growth rate,Positive
and 27% in Europe,Neutral
"Third quarter revenue for surveillance was $146.8 million up 8% from the third quarter of 2016. Airborne and man portable products were particularly strong, compared to the prior year and the addition of the UAS business added inorganic revenue growth all partially offset by a decline in our land products due do a difficult comparison in the prior year",Positive
"Moving to Slide 11, instruments revenue of $91.4 million was up 11% over the third quarter of 2016. Broad product line growth drove this increase with particular strength in both volume and premium handheld plant predictive maintenance cameras as well as growth in our automation cameras",Positive
The acquired integrated imaging solutions line of business was the driver of this growth,Positive
"OM and emerging operating profit grew 30% year-over-year to reach an all-time quarterly high of $26.9 million, operating margin of 31% did decline 200 basis points versus the prior year, due to higher operating expenses, primarily related to product development and yield improvement initiatives",Negative
"Securities LOREX business grew significantly due to sell-ins of our new 4K Ultra HD bundle and our wire-free camera system to two major retailers, some of which was revenue pushed in from Q2. We saw significant growth in LOREX web channel as well",Positive
"FLIR-branded Professional Visible Security solutions grew 12% year-over-year, while thermal security products were flat to the prior year",Positive
Security operating income grew 36% to $6.5 million year-over-year due to the strong topline and a reduction in operating expenses,Positive
"Maritime segment revenue was $42.3 million, up 4% versus the prior year, despite the negative impact of Hurricanes in the U.S",Negative
"New products drove broad growth across the Raymarine business, which was partially offset by weakness in thermal cameras due to increased customer vetting processes",Positive
Maritime operating income grew 42% to $4.5 million or 11% of revenue,Positive
"Stronger gross margins mix with controlled operations spending resulting in another quarter of operating margin improvement, this time by 280 basis points compared to Q3 of 2016. That concludes my summary of the financials and the segments",Positive
I'll now pass it back over to Jim,Neutral
"Drew, we've been a fairly acquisitive company",Neutral
We intend to be -- continue to be acquisitive,Neutral
Q1 was a really tough comp,Neutral
Q3 also was a tough comp,Neutral
"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone",Neutral
2016 was yet another strong year for Gartner,Neutral
"The combination of the tremendous value we provide to our clients around the world, the investments we are making to capture our vast market opportunity, our focus on strong operational execution, and our exceptional business model saw us continue our trend of delivering double-digit growth with strong free cash flow conversion",Positive
"On an FX neutral basis, our year-over-year financial performance for the full year 2016 included total company revenue growth of 14%, Research revenue growth of 17%, normalized EBITDA growth of 10%, and diluted earnings per share excluding acquisition adjustments of $2.96 per share or 24% growth",Positive
"During the fourth quarter, we saw an acceleration in our contract value growth along with sequential improvements in our retention metrics and sales productivity",Positive
"And as our 2017 outlook demonstrates, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth with strong cash flow generation",Positive
"On an FX neutral basis, our year-over-year financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2016 included, contract value growth of 14% and Research revenue growth of 15%, Events revenue growth of 2% on a same-event basis, Consulting revenue growth of 1%, normalized EBITDA growth of 3% and diluted EPS excluding acquisition adjustments of $0.97 per share",Positive
I will close with remarks on our 2017 guidance,Neutral
And we will then be happy to take your questions,Neutral
Beginning with Research,Neutral
Research revenue grew 14% on an as-reported and 15% on an FX neutral basis in the fourth quarter,Positive
Our newest acquisitions had a less than 1 point impact on Research revenue growth for the quarter,Positive
"The gross contribution margin for Research in Q4 was 68%, a 40 basis point increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. On a full year basis, the gross contribution margin for Research was 69% in 2016, flat when compared to the full year 2015. Building on the positive momentum that we highlighted last quarter, all of our Research business metrics remained very strong and improved on a sequential basis",Positive
Total contract value was $1.930 billion as of the end of Q4 or FX neutral growth of 14% versus the prior year,Positive
We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business,Positive
"Our growth in total contract value continues to be broad-based with every region, every client size and virtually every industry segment growing at double-digit rates",Positive
"Consistent with this, our retention metrics remain very strong and are near all-time highs",Positive
"New business growth remained strong, up 13% from last year's fourth quarter",Positive
Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises,Positive
This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth through both new and existing enterprises,Positive
"The denominator is our beginning of period head count, which was our Q4 2015 ending head count of 2,171. Equally as important, our standalone Q4 2016 sales productivity increased by 12% on an FX neutral basis over Q4 of 2015. As always, we remain highly focused on improving our sales productivity and remain confident that the initiatives we have implemented to drive productivity will positively impact our results over both the short and long-term",Positive
"To sum up, we delivered another strong quarter in Research with an acceleration in CV growth and sequential improvements in both our retention metrics, as well as sales productivity",Positive
Moving to Events,Neutral
"And lastly, the year-on-year comparison in Q4 was especially tough, following the exceptionally strong 15% same-events year-on-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. We held 14 events in Q4, one less than in the prior year quarter, and on a same-events basis, attendees were up 3% versus last year",Positive
"Events' Q4 gross contribution margin was 54%, down by approximately 350 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower than expected revenues",Negative
"On a full year basis, Events revenues increased by 6% in 2016 or 8% on a same-events basis and its gross margin contribution of 51% was down slightly compared to 2015. As we look forward to Q1 and the full year 2017 outlook, we have a fuller, more tenured sales force driving our Events business and our forward-looking indicators are strong",Positive
This is reflected in our 2017 guidance that calls for Events returning to double-digit growth,Positive
Turning to Consulting,Neutral
Our labor-based business was approximately flat versus Q4 of last year with modest growth for contract optimization practice,Positive
"On the labor-based side, billable head count of 628 was up 4% from the year ago quarter and fourth quarter annualized revenue per billable head count ended at $372,000, which was down by 4% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis",Negative
"Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business ended the quarter at $104 million, down 9% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis",Positive
Consulting gross contribution margin declined by 310 basis points year-on-year,Negative
"On a full-year basis, Consulting revenues increased by 6% on an FX neutral basis, in line with our long-term growth target range of 3% to 8% and we expect to continue this growth trend in 2017. Moving down the income statement",Positive
"SG&A increased by 12% year-over-year in fourth quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force",Positive
"For the full year, normalized EBITDA was $457 million, representing 12% growth for 2016 or a 10% increase on an FX neutral basis",Positive
Moving down the income statement,Neutral
"Depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter reflecting higher capital spending to support our growth, while acquisition and integration charges declined by 12% reflecting the impact and timing of acquisitions made in recent years",Negative
Turning now to cash,Neutral
"For the full year 2016, free cash flow was $347 million, up 10% compared to full year 2015. Free cash flow was modestly below our expectations due to a combination of Q4 Events performance and the timing of our CV growth",Positive
"Managing our business to generate strong cash flow is one of our top priorities, consistent with the negative working capital dynamics that are a key characteristic of our subscription-based business model, we continue to generate free cash flow well in excess of net income",Positive
"We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, cash position and liquidity profile",Positive
"Our guidance is consistent with our performance over the last several years, as we are again projecting at the midpoint of our guidance range, double-digit growth in revenues, EBITDA and EPS, on an FX neutral basis",Positive
We are expecting total revenues for 2017 of $2.680 billion to $2.745 billion or 12% to 14% growth on an FX neutral basis,Positive
Turning to our three business segment,Neutral
"First, revenues for the Research segment are expected to be $2.050 billion to $2.085 billion in 2017, FX neutral growth of 14% to 16%",Positive
"Again continuing our trend of mid teens growth for our largest, most profitable and most cash generative segment",Positive
"Second, we expect Consulting revenues of $345 million to $360 million or 2% to 7% FX neutral growth compared to 2016 and consistent with our longer term outlook of 3% to 8% annual growth",Positive
"And third, we expect to deliver Events revenues of $285 million to $300 million, 8% to 14% growth on an FX neutral basis",Positive
This continues our trend of meeting or exceeding our long-term growth outlook for this segment,Positive
We currently expect to hold approximately 69 events in 2017 compared to 66 in 2016. We expect normalized EBITDA for the full year 2017 to be between $495 million and $530 million or 9% to 17% growth over 2016 on an FX neutral basis,Positive
"Excluding acquisition and integration charges, our guidance for EPS is to be between $3.15 and $3.35 per share in 2017. This represents 6% to 13% growth to full year 2016 or 10% at the midpoint of the guidance range and includes approximately a 1% headwind related to FX",Positive
"We are not forecasting those items to occur again in 2017. Normalizing for those items, the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance yields 14% EPS growth versus 2016, which is in line with the midpoint of our EBITDA growth guidance for 2017. For 2017 we are guiding operating cash flow of $385 million to $415 million, or 5% to 14% growth on a year-over-year basis",Positive
"We anticipate cash outflows for acquisition and integration charges to be $38 million in 2017. As a growth company, with a growing associate population, one of our larger capital expense items are real estate projects",Positive
"Inclusive of these two large products, our capital expense guidance is for $75 million to $80 million in 2017. Putting this together equates to free cash flow of $348 million to $373 million in 2017 or flat to 7% growth over 2016. Normalizing for the two major projects I just mentioned, free cash flow would be increasing by between 7% and 14%",Positive
"Starting with our guidance for Q1 2017. If you recall, we had an unusually strong first quarter in 2016 with 81% year-on-year growth in adjusted EPS, driven by a combination of very strong growth in Events and Consulting as well as a few non-recurring below the line benefits, such as lower stock-based compensation expense that we do not expect to repeat in Q1 2017. We expect that Q1 will be our lightest quarter of the year from both a total company and Events revenue perspective",Positive
"Just to double click on Events, we expect Q1 2017 revenues to be proportionally similar to Q1 2016. For Consulting, we expect to see a modest year-on-year decline in revenues, when compared to the unusually strong 11% year-on-year growth from Q1 2016. Completing the primary drivers of our Q1 EPS, we expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%, and 27% on a normalized basis",Positive
"As a result, we expect GAAP EPS to be between $0.45 and $0.48 per share in the first quarter of 2017, including approximately $0.13 per share of acquisition and integration charges in Q1. And as in past years, the fourth quarter is expected to be our largest, with more than 50% of the full year Events revenue occurring in Q4. Finally, I'd like to spend a moment on the impact of foreign exchange, as it relates to our reported total contract value",Negative
We do this so you can understand the true organic growth in our Research segment,Positive
"As a result, $1.903 billion is the baseline figure you should use for comparison purposes when judging contract value growth in 2017 on an FX neutral basis",Positive
"We delivered another very strong quarter in Research in Q4, capping off another strong year of mid-teens revenue growth for our largest and most valuable segment",Positive
"In 2016, we saw improved momentum in total contract value, delivering 14% CV growth and our client and wallet retention metrics are near all-time highs",Positive
"And as our 2017 outlook demonstrates, we expect to continue our trend of double-digit growth with strong cash flow generation",Positive
"We are in a very strong position to capture the vast market opportunity ahead of us and continue to live, to deliver long-term value for our shareholders",Positive
We believe this will further enhance our ability to generate long-term double-digit growth with strong free cash flow conversion,Positive
Yes,Neutral
Good morning Anj,Neutral
"As we've discussed all the time as we've talked about our market opportunity, we have strong conviction in the fact that we have an enormous market opportunity in all of the enterprises that currently don't do business with us and we have an enormous market opportunity even in our existing enterprises",Positive
I wouldn't read too much into it,Neutral
"We drove really nice new business growth over the course of the year, and we did accelerate our CV growth rate over the course of the year up to 14% as well",Positive
"And so as we go forward, we again, expect to see about what we have seen historically which is about two-thirds of our growth come from further penetration of existing enterprises and about one-third of our growth come from net new logos",Positive
Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay,Neutral
"Good morning, Tim",Neutral
The improvement we saw was broad based,Neutral
That alone does not account for the acceleration in CV growth,Positive
"Yes, it was small impact, less than 1 point on the overall growth rate",Positive
"Important note, SCM World was in last quarter",Neutral
That's ultimately the strategy,Neutral
"We do believe that over the long term that will result in the things I just mentioned, which are more stable revenue growth, more stable utilization",Positive
"Good morning, Manav",Neutral
It's the typical range of outcomes,Neutral
"If we have accelerated CV growth earlier in the year, that obviously can flow through and impact the earnings as well",Positive
"Good morning, Jeff",Neutral
"In terms of the head count growth, as we have talked, we do a bottoms up planning exercise around all the territory growth we want to do at any given year",Positive
But our overarching planning assumption as we rolled it up from the bottom netted out to about 13% territory growth and that's what we baked into the plan,Positive
We don't plan based on hope,Neutral
We plan based on what we've actually achieved,Neutral
Sure,Neutral
"Good morning, Jeff",Neutral
"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone",Neutral
"Because of the tremendous value we provide to our clients around the world, the investments we are making to capture our vast market opportunity, our focus on strong operational execution and our exceptional business model, we delivered yet another quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth",Positive
"On an FX-neutral basis, our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included total company revenue growth of 13%, contract value of 15%, Research revenue growth of 15%, Events revenue growth of 11%, Consulting revenue growth of 2%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 1%, and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.60 per share, which was towards the top end of our guidance range for the quarter",Positive
We will then be happy to take your questions,Neutral
Beginning with Research; Research revenue grew 15% on both a reported and FX-neutral basis in the first quarter,Positive
Acquisitions had a one-point impact on Research revenue growth for the quarter,Positive
"The gross contribution margin for Research was 69%, a one-point decline compared to the first quarter of 2016. Our other Research business metrics also remain very strong, and we continue to see robust demand for our services across the globe",Positive
"Total contract value was $1.95 billion as of the end of Q1, FX-neutral growth of 15% versus the prior year",Positive
"Excluding L2, total contract value growth would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, consistent with the 14% growth we delivered last quarter",Positive
We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business,Positive
"New business growth remained strong, up 13% year-on-year in Q1. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients",Positive
"Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity, with both new and existing client enterprises",Positive
This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth through both new and existing enterprises,Positive
"As always, we remain highly focused on improving our sales productivity and remain confident that the initiatives we have implemented drive productivity will positively impact our results over both the short and long term",Positive
"To sum up, it was another strong quarter for our largest and most profitable segment",Positive
"And as you'll see from our updated outlook, we continue to target another year of mid-teens growth",Positive
"Events Q1 gross contribution margin was 38%, down by approximately 200 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016. This was primarily due to higher year-on-year investments to support our growth strategy in a seasonally light quarter",Positive
"In summary, we had a strong Q1 in our Events business",Positive
Our outlook remains unchanged,Neutral
We still expect double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis for the full year,Positive
"Turning to Consulting; on an as-reported basis, first quarter Consulting revenues were flat year-on-year and increased by 2% on an FX-neutral basis, coming off a very strong Q1 last year",Positive
"Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $103 million, down 9% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis",Positive
"Consulting gross contribution margin declined by 140 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to a modestly lower utilization but was up strongly on a sequential basis",Positive
"For the full year, we continue to target Consulting revenues growth of 2% to 7% on an FX-neutral basis, in-line with our long-term growth target range of 3% to 8%",Positive
Moving down the income statement; SG&A increased by 18% year-over-year in the first quarter,Negative
"As we detailed on our Q1 2016 call, our Q1 results were positively impacted by lower stock compensation expense related to changes to the executive team",Positive
This is an increase of 223 or 10% from a year ago,Neutral
"On a normalized basis, our quota-bearing sales growth was around 11.5%, and we continue to plan for approximately 13% sales head count growth in 2017. Moving on to EBITDA and earnings; adjusted EBITDA was $106 million in the first quarter, meeting our Q1 EBITDA expectation",Positive
"Adjusted EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% on an FX-neutral basis, as top-line growth was partially offset by the higher SG&A spend, I just referenced",Positive
"Moving down the income statement; depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter reflecting capital spending to support our growth, while acquisition and integration charges increased by almost $5 million",Positive
"So we are right where we targeted to be coming out of Q1. The year-on-year growth rate was, obviously, impacted by our Q1 2016 adjusted EPS, which as you may recall, was up 65% last year",Positive
"Our new business bookings accelerated over the course of the first quarter, culminating in an exceptionally strong March",Positive
This yields free cash outflow of $23 million,Neutral
"The year-on-year changes primarily driven by the timing of contract value growth in the quarter and the related collections, as I just described, higher incentive payments, higher CapEx and higher acquisition and integration payments",Positive
"Relative to the $703 million of gross debt we had at the end of 2016, our gross debt increased by approximately $2.9 billion related to the acquisitions of CEB and L2. In total, we had approximately $3.6 billion of gross debt as of April 5, comprising of the following: $1.485 billion of term loan A; $500 million of term loan B; $545 million drawn on our revolver; $800 million of high-yield bonds; and $300 million of bridge financing",Neutral
"In total, we have $1.4 billion of hedges in place",Neutral
"Using CEB's methodology, constant currency CEB segment contract value growth was down about 1% year-over-year, while constant currency CEB segment wallet retention was 89%, flat year-on-year, but up by more than 1 point sequentially",Positive
"However, given that the CEB transaction closed only a month ago, please note that our GAAP estimates are likely to be subject to change as we complete purchase accounting and further refine our estimates for other GAAP-related expenses",Positive
"On a GAAP basis, our 2017 earnings per share is expected to be significantly impacted by acquisition-related accounting and integration charges, of which the vast majority are noncash in nature",Negative
"Turning to our cash flow guidance, similar to GAAP EPS, our 2017 operating cash flow is expected to be significantly impacted by charges related to the CEB acquisition as well as incremental interest expense",Negative
It is worth noting that CEB's strongest free cash flow quarter has historically been Q1. This was true in 2017 as well,Positive
"What you see in our combined free cash flow guidance reflects 12 months of Gartner and nine months of CEB, but excluding CEB's strongest quarter",Positive
"Therefore, on an adjusted basis, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.80 and $0.85 for the second quarter 2017. In closing, we had a strong start to the year, and we expect this performance to continue throughout the balance of 2017. Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth, and contract value growth was 15%",Positive
"Our Events business is back on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017, and Consulting delivered another quarter of growth, following a very strong year-ago quarter",Positive
"From a standalone Gartner perspective, our 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook is largely unchanged, and we expect to continue our trend of double-digit growth",Positive
"On an adjusted basis, the acquisition of CEB is expected to be immediately accretive with between 5% and 7% accretion in 2017. We also continue to expect double-digit percentage adjusted EPS accretion in 2018 and remain confident in our ability to generate long-term double-digit growth with strong free cash flow conversion",Positive
"I'll now turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions",Positive
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"The revenue, in a sense, it doesn't get locked, but it gets close to locked based on where they finish 2016. 2017 is really a transition year is the way to think about it",Neutral
"As Gene mentioned, we're laying all the groundwork, so that we can accelerate growth in years beyond",Positive
That's helpful,Neutral
"And as a follow-up, with regards to standalone Gartner, could you speak to the selling environment as it relates to the productivity? Is it having any dampening impact that you would call out? Perhaps if you can just give us a sense of what the improvement in productivity may have been if you had to adjust for that M&A impact? And I may have missed it, but what is your expectation for how long the M&A activity may impact some of your KPI?",Negative
"And then also last year, the acquisition of Evanta didn't happen until Q2. And so we've got the grow-over problem of expenses that weren't in there last year, plus the revenue doesn't really start coming in until Q2. There's also, as you can probably see from the revenue, a decline year-over-year on revenues of about $9 million, that's also flowing through",Negative
"And, Manav",Neutral
And we're not satisfied at 83% or 84%,Neutral
"And again, the target that we've talked about, ranging up to $50 million, we're working very diligently to be in a place where we can harvest as much of that in 2018. That said, given when contracts run through or the timing of when we can reduce or eliminate certain costs may roll into 2018. So think of that more on a run rate basis or an annualized basis as opposed to all coming through in 2018. That said, we're going to do our best to harvest as much of that as possible in 2018.",Neutral
"And Jeff, just to add to that, the way we think about it is, the best way for us to drive growth and penetrate accounts is for the people who specialize in selling IT, supply chain, HR, whatever it might be, to actually go do that and talk to the HR professional, supply chain professionals, marketing professionals direct",Neutral
"But again, the way we drive productivity and the way we drive growth is by actually having those salespeople specialize in those functions going after those functions",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"But again, what we feel good about is we've had really strong performance, Q3, Q4 into Q1, and we expect that to continue",Positive
"And Peter, and we also â€“ as we've talked about, we go faster in places where we have the management capability to handle and very strong productivity and we obviously slowed down in areas that may be impacted by macro things and have lower productivity",Positive
"And what we said for this year was we had â€“ on that bottoms-up view, we expected around 13% head count growth",Positive
"If we challenges, we may pump the brakes on it",Neutral
"Hey, Bill, it's Craig",Neutral
"Yeah, hey, Jeff, it's Craig",Neutral
"On a standalone basis, the way we thought about it is, as I mentioned, the prime driver of what we saw in Q1 was really the timing of our contract value growth with more of it coming in March then in January and February",Positive
"Good morning, Mike",Neutral
The way we are thinking about it and modeling it and is consistent with what we talked about when we announced the acquisition is that we are targeting to get down to around three times gross leverage over the next 24 months to 36 months,Neutral
"That will be modest, but I would expect the real de-levering to start moving in earnest over the course of 2018 and through 2019. And again, within 24 months to 36 months, we're targeting to get down to three times gross leverage",Negative
"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone",Neutral
Starting with Research,Neutral
"Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment, representing approximately 72% of our combined full year 2016 company revenues and approximately 80% of total gross contribution",Positive
"For modeling and comparability purposes, we are also providing historical revenues, adjusted revenues and contribution margin for the combined company in our full reportable segments for the four quarters of 2016, as well as Q1 2017. This information along with an in-depth overview of our Q2 performance is available in the two documents we have furnished to accompany this call, both located on our Investor Relations website",Neutral
"Turning to our Q2 performance, our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included total combined company adjusted revenue growth of 9%, driven by 13% growth for the traditional Gartner business and a 3% decline for the acquired CEB business",Negative
We will then be happy to take your questions,Neutral
Beginning with Research,Neutral
"On a combined basis, adjusted Research revenue grew 11% in the second quarter",Positive
The adjusted gross contribution margin for Research was 68% or a 130 basis point decline compared to the second quarter of 2016 on a comparable basis,Negative
"This modest decline is primarily due to our newer acquired businesses such as Capterra, SCM World and L2 having lower gross contribution margins than traditional business",Negative
"Acquisitions, primarily L2 and SCM World had a slightly less than 2 point impact on the traditional Gartner Research adjusted revenue growth for the quarter",Positive
"Our other traditional Gartner Research business metrics also remained very strong with accelerating contract value growth, accelerating sales productivity and improvements in our retention metrics",Positive
"Total contract value was almost $2 billion as of the end of Q2, FX-neutral growth of 15% versus the prior year, and an acceleration from the growth we delivered last quarter",Positive
"On an organic basis, excluding the contribution of L2, which we acquired in March 2017, total contract value growth for traditional Gartner Research would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, also an acceleration from the growth we delivered last quarter",Positive
We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth of new business,Positive
"New business growth for traditional Gartner Research remained strong, up 14% year-on-year in Q2. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients",Positive
Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises,Positive
This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth through both new and existing enterprises,Positive
"As always, we remain highly focused on improving our sales productivity and remain confident that the initiatives we have implemented to drive productivity will positively impact the results of both the short and long-term",Positive
"Turning to the performance of CEB Research in the quarter; CEB adjusted research revenues declined by 1% year-on-year in Q2, an improvement from the 4% year-on-year decline in Q1. CEB's other research metrics also improved in the quarter",Negative
Moving to Events,Neutral
"On a combined basis, adjusted Events revenues increased by 10% year-on-year in Q2. Events' second quarter adjusted gross contribution margin was 56%, down by approximately 200 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter",Negative
"While CEB Events revenue was approximately flat on a year-on-year basis, the traditional Gartner Events business had a very strong quarter in Q2, with a 13% year-on-year increase in same-event revenue, a more than 100 basis point year-on-year improvement in contribution margin, and an 18% increase in same-event attendees",Positive
"Turning to Consulting, on a comparable basis, second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 6% on a reported basis and 8% FX-neutral, driven by a strong performance in our contract optimization business",Positive
"Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for Consulting business, ended the quarter at $91 million, down 1% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis",Positive
"Consulting gross contribution margin increased by 160 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to the strong performance of the contract optimization business",Positive
Turning to TA & Other,Neutral
Adjusted revenue in the TA & Other segment declined by 6% compared to the year-ago quarter,Negative
Moving down the income statement,Neutral
"This is an increase of 277 or 12% from a year ago, and we continue to plan for approximately 13% sales head count growth for the traditional Gartner business in 2017. The acquisition of CEB adds more than 500 quota-bearing research sales associates",Positive
"While this is essentially flat on a year-on-year basis, as Gene mentioned, we have already started to grow sales head count and we'll leverage our proven best practices around recruiting, training and tools to drive accelerated CV growth and improved productivity",Positive
"As a growth company and now as a much larger growth company, we also continue to invest in areas such as recruiting, technology, facilities and other areas to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long-term",Positive
"At the same time, we're making good progress on cost synergies related to the CEB acquisition, specifically in G&A functions",Positive
"Given the investments we have already made and plan to make through the balance of the year to drive accelerated growth in CEB's contract value, we continue to expect very modest net synergy flow through in 2017. We remain on track to deliver on our 2018 cost synergy target and are working very diligently to harvest as much of the $50 million as possible in 2018. Moving down the income statement; depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter, predominantly reflecting the addition of CEB, while amortization and integration charges were up significant, again related to the transaction",Negative
Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 35.4%,Neutral
A lower than expected adjusted tax rate positively impacted our Q2 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04. This was primarily due to the timing of certain tax costs that are expected to be realized in the remainder of the year,Positive
"As I commented last quarter, CEB has historically had different cash flow seasonality at Gartner, where CEB's strongest cash flow quarter has been Q1, followed by its weakest quarter in Q2. On a combined basis, operating cash flow increased by 1% in Q2. It is also important to note that our Q2 operating cash flow includes significant acquisition and integration payments, which we adjust out for our free cash flow calculation",Positive
"Pivoting the free cash flow, Q2 2017 CapEx was $31 million and Q2 cash acquisition and integration payments were $48 million, compared to less than $1 million in Q2 2016. This yields Q2 free cash flow of $129 million, approximately 50% higher when compared to combined company free cash flow in Q2 2016. The timing of our contract value growth is a key driver of our quarterly free cash flow performance and our strong research results from March and across Q2 have begun converting to free cash flow",Positive
This is comprised of the following,Neutral
"For the traditional Gartner Research business, we expect to continue our trend of mid-teen revenue growth in 2017. This is obviously supported by the very strong contract value growth we just reported",Positive
"For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $214 million and $226 million",Positive
"First, the vast majority of our change is due to our decision to accelerate certain frontline investments in areas that will fuel CEB's growth for the future",Positive
"The other and smaller change is to our outlook for the Evanta and Talent Assessment businesses, where we've had to focus on fortifying the structures we have acquired to set them up for future growth",Positive
"As I commented last quarter, our GAAP 2017 earnings per share is expected to be significantly impacted by acquisition and integration charges, of which the vast majority are non-cash in nature",Negative
"In addition, our tax rate may also vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the projected geographic mix of earnings, the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to stock-based awards, as well as the timing of certain items",Negative
"Therefore, on an adjusted basis, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.48 and $0.52 per share for the third quarter 2017. To provide some additional color on expected seasonal trends, third quarter is typically a seasonally light events quarter from both the traditional Gartner and CEB Events perspective, followed by a seasonally-strong Q4, where we typically generate half of our annual Events revenue",Positive
"In closing, we had a strong start to the year and we expect this performance to continue throughout the balance of 2017. Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth and contract value growth was 15%",Positive
"We also saw acceleration in our CV growth, sales productivity and retention measures",Positive
Our Events business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017 and Consulting delivered another quarter of growth following a very strong year-ago quarter,Positive
"From a standalone Gartner perspective, our 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook is largely unchanged and we expect to continue our trend of double-digit growth",Positive
"Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions",Positive
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"And Jeff, it's Craig",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"Good morning, Gary",Neutral
"So, we actually expect to deliver nice growth in Events contribution in Q4 as well",Positive
"So, it's really those two factors",Neutral
"Yeah, sure",Neutral
"Hey, good morning, Tim",Neutral
"The way to think about it is, I think the majority of the change relates to us accelerating investments that we believe will drive great long-term value",Positive
"So, think in the 60%, 70% of the change, balance related to some softness on TA and Evanta revenues",Neutral
"And also, quite frankly, investing with the right leadership and filling out the team so that we can actually deliver over the long-term in those two businesses as well, but think roughly 60%, 70% on the acceleration investment, balance on fortifying the TA and Evanta businesses",Neutral
"So, Tim, I think that the way to think about it is the acceleration on the investment are some of the things that Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks, so probably the biggest one related to actually starting to grow the sales force, again where CEB Research sales had been flattish, the number of head count over the last several years",Neutral
"Number two, if we get them onboard and trained over the course of 2017, while there'll still be new sales people, who inherently have lower productivity, they will actually yield some benefit in 2018. But again, you know the cycle of how, when we hire new sales people in year one, they're less productive, in year two they're a little bit more productive and then by the year three they typically look like a fully-tenured sales person",Neutral
"It's a great question, Tim",Neutral
"The â€“ what I can tell you is, through the end of 2017, we will breakout contract value growth and wallet retention for the traditional Gartner business and the traditional CEB business",Positive
"So, the fidelity gets a little hard to track",Neutral
"That said, we'll figure out the right way to provide transparency and progress on was the traditional Gartner business maybe with a few tweaks based on those integration adjustments I mentioned and on the traditional CEB business, again with a couple of tweaks to reflect how we've actually integrated and are running the business",Neutral
"And Anj, it's Craig",Neutral
"Number one is what you typically think about around retention, which is making sure the clients are getting consistent value over the life of the contract and renewing year after year after year after year, and again we have best practices around how to do that and we're already as we mentioned earlier rolling out portions or all of those best practices across the way we service the CEB Research clients",Neutral
Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay,Neutral
That's helpful,Neutral
"And then for the second question, I was wondering if you can speak to sales force productivity x-L2, that's â€“ it's really strong improvement year-over-year, so any further elaboration on which training programs are driving this",Positive
And the other I'd mentioned Anj and I think you know this from conversations with us over the years is there's no finish line for us in terms of productivity,Neutral
We are pleased that we've seen some improvement,Neutral
Because we know that ultimately improving our sales productivity will accelerate our contract value and research revenue growth,Positive
"Good morning, Andrew (sic) [Henry]",Neutral
It's Craig,Neutral
"On the margin side, if you think about from a business perspective, if you go segment-by-segment, our view is that the CEB Research products will run at roughly the same gross margin and incremental gross margin targets that we run the traditional Gartner business at",Neutral
"So, think in the 70% range",Neutral
I think same thing on the Events side,Neutral
"We haven't really changed the margin profile all that much, and again we're trying to drive significant growth in both of those businesses and so I'd expect margins maybe on research to improve a little bit as we're tracking a little bit behind the 70% over time, but essentially kind of tracking where we are",Neutral
"But on the sales side and given the size of the market opportunity, we expect to continue to invest in growing the CEB sales force to drive accelerated contract value growth on the traditional CEB business",Positive
"So, we're going to utilize the gross margin leverage we talked about earlier to continue to fund growth in both the Gartner sales force, again given the size of the market opportunity and the traditional CEB sales force to go capture that market opportunity over the long-term",Positive
"The one other thing I'd add that is the â€“ as Gene mentioned, the new seat-based products include the best of both, so in his example on HR, it's the great core CEB Research and deliverables and assets combined with the relevant Gartner technology",Positive
"And so, as we continue to innovate and improve those seat-based products, I think over time, and this is what we saw on the Gartner journey from over a decade ago, clients will over time migrate over, upgrade over to the new products, because they're better",Neutral
"And again, as Gene mentioned, if they're happy and they want to keep renewing and keep paying us, we're happy to let them keep doing that",Positive
"And good morning, everyone",Neutral
"Because of the tremendous value we provide to our clients around the world, the investments we are making to capture our vast market opportunity, our focus on strong operational execution and our exceptional business model, we delivered another strong quarter",Positive
"On a combined basis, our adjusted revenue grew 11% in the third quarter of 2017. As Gene detailed, we are also progressing in accordance with our plans to integrate CEB into the Gartner business",Positive
Turning to our Q3 performance,Neutral
"Our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included total combined company adjusted revenue growth of 11%, driven by 15% growth for the traditional Gartner business and a 1% decline for the acquired CEB business; combined adjusted EBITDA of $149 million and combined adjusted diluted EPS of $0.65 per share, which is $0.13 above the top-end of our guidance range for the quarter",Negative
We will then be happy to take your questions,Neutral
Beginning with Research,Neutral
"On a combined basis, adjusted Research revenue grew 13% in the third quarter",Positive
The adjusted gross contribution margin for Research was 69% or an 80 basis point decline compared to the third quarter of 2016 on a comparable basis,Negative
"This modest decline is primarily due to our newer-acquired businesses such as Capterra, SCM World and L2 having lower gross contribution margins than our traditional business",Negative
"Acquisitions, primarily L2 and Machina Research, contributed to adjusted revenue growth in the quarter by less than 2 points",Positive
"Our other metrics for the traditional Gartner Research business also remained very strong with 15% CV growth, accelerating sales productivity and improvements in our retention metrics",Positive
"Total contract value was $2.063 billion as of the end of Q3. FX neutral growth of 15% versus the prior year, roughly in line with the growth we delivered last quarter",Positive
"On an organic basis, excluding the contribution of L2, which we acquired in March 2017, total contract value growth for the traditional Gartner Research would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, also consistent with the growth we delivered last quarter",Positive
We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business,Positive
"New business growth for traditional Gartner Research remained strong, up 11% year-on-year in Q3. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades through existing clients",Positive
Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises,Positive
This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CEB growth through both new and existing enterprises,Positive
"We remain confident that the initiatives around recruiting, training and tools that we have implemented to drive productivity will positively impact our results over both the short and long term",Positive
"Turning to the performance of CEB research in the quarter, CEB adjusted research revenues were flat year-on-year in Q3, a modest improvement from the year-on-year decline in Q2. We saw many positives with CEB's other research metrics in the quarter despite a modest decline in contract value",Negative
We are confident these impacts are temporary and that the actions we are taking position us well to drive growth and value in the future,Positive
"The traditional Gartner Events business had a very strong quarter in Q3 with a 25% year-on-year increase in revenues, driven by an 18% increase in the same event revenues",Positive
"Turning to Consulting, third quarter Consulting revenues declined by 2% on a reported basis and declined 3% on an FX-neutral basis",Negative
"In the labor-based business, revenues declined 1% versus Q3 of last year, while the contract optimization business was down 11%",Negative
"Broadly speaking, the MP strategy is working",Neutral
"We'll be temporarily slowing down our MP growth on those two teams, so that we can focus on improving productivity",Positive
"Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business ended the quarter at $91 million, up 2% year-on-year",Positive
Our bookings performance strengthened in September and our Q4 pipeline looks strong as well,Positive
"Consulting gross contribution margin decreased by 230 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to modest softness in the contract optimization business and a slight decline in utilization",Negative
"Turning to Talent Assessment & Other, adjusted revenue in the TA & Other segment declined by 4% compared to the year-ago quarter",Negative
"Moving down the income statement, on a combined basis, SG&A increased by 13% year-over-year in the third quarter",Negative
FX had a roughly 1 point impact on the growth rate,Positive
This is an increase of 385 or 17% from a year ago,Neutral
"We will leverage our proven best practices around recruiting, training and tools to drive accelerated CV growth and improved productivity",Positive
"As a growth company and now as a much larger growth company, we continue to invest in areas such as recruiting, technology, facilities and other areas to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long term",Positive
"At the same time, we continue to make good progress on cost synergies related to the CEB acquisition, specifically in the G&A functions",Positive
"Through the investments we've already made and plan to make through the balance of the year to drive accelerated growth in CEB's contract value, we continue to expect modest net synergy flow-through in 2017. We continue to work the cost synergy side of the equation and we'll report back on our progress in subsequent quarters",Positive
"This result is driven by growth for traditional Gartner EBITDA, offset by year-over-year decline to traditional CEB EBITDA",Negative
Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.2%,Neutral
This contributed approximately $0.04 of upside,Neutral
These two items contributed about $0.04 of upside,Neutral
"This yields Q3 free cash flow of $144 million, approximately 14% higher when compared to combined company free cash flow in Q3 2016. The timing of our contract value growth is a key driver of our quarterly free cash flow performance and our strong Research results from March Q2 and across Q3 have begun converting to free cash flow",Positive
This is comprised of the following,Neutral
"For the traditional Gartner Research business, we expect to continue our trend of mid-teen revenue growth in 2017. This is obviously supported by the very strong contract value growth we just reported",Positive
"For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $210 million and $225 million",Positive
"As I commented last quarter, our GAAP 2017 earnings per share is expected to be significantly impacted by acquisition and integration charges, of which the vast majority are non-cash in nature",Negative
"In addition, our tax rate may also vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the projected geographic mix of earnings, the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to stock-based awards as well as the timing of certain items",Negative
It's our largest Events and Consulting quarter,Neutral
"As we have rolled into the fourth quarter of 2017, we have great momentum in the traditional Gartner Research business and our NCVI performance through 2017 flows into the P&L",Positive
"We are expecting to finish Q4 in the year strongly, consistent with our performance through the first three quarters of 2017. In closing, we've continued our strong 2017 performance through the third quarter",Positive
Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth and contract value growth was 15%,Positive
"Our Events business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017, and the adjustments we are making in Consulting should position us strongly for the future",Positive
"Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions",Positive
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"And, Tim, it's Craig",Neutral
A little over 500.,Neutral
"And the other thing I'd add, Gary, good morning, is fundamentally the new seat-based products, because they do leverage best of both research from the traditional CEB side and from a traditional Gartner side and because they are seat-based products sold to a specific individual and then servicing a specific individual are, by their very nature, higher value products",Positive
"So, it sounds like a big number in terms of the absolute growth rate, but again like we do on the Gartner side, we are managing it, so that it's not wildly disruptive in terms of our go-to-market and selling processes for next year",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"The good news is, as our average productivity has shown improvement for the last couple of quarters, that gives us the confidence in more areas quite frankly",Positive
"But as they progress in their tenure, you can look to see nice improvements over time in their overall productivity",Positive
"We're not at a point yet where we're giving 2018 guidance, but I do think the way to think about it, particularly on the traditional Gartner side is, we will enter 2018 at current course and speed with a larger army and we are very focused on driving the productivity of that army as we head into 2018.",Neutral
These are absolutely the right things to do to support and drive future sustained growth,Positive
"Again, with all these changes, as Gene mentioned earlier, CEB contract value is still kind of on-trend to what its performance had been prior to the acquisition, while we're getting ourselves ready to actually tune up the machine and drive growth into the future",Positive
"And so, again, we're thinking about this around laying the foundation for future growth and, again, having seat-based products, having them with the right kind of contract terms, having them with pricing discipline are all the right things to do as we head into the future",Neutral
Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay,Neutral
That's great color,Neutral
"It's a great question, Anj",Neutral
Anjaneya K,Neutral
Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay,Neutral
"And it's just a great opportunity for, as Gene mentioned, Gartner seat holders to go and actually experience the research live and for non-Gartner seat holders to go and experience the research live",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"We're driving very strong managing partner productivity, broadly speaking again, across the business",Positive
We have two pockets of challenges,Neutral
"Yeah, Hamzah, it's Craig",Neutral
"Just to add to that, I think your observation around lack of or limited investment is 100% spot on",Neutral
"And again what we've done and we've learned this through experience on our own side is you have to find that right balance and the additional 80 right now in terms of that, first foray of significant growth, coupled with all the other operational change we're implementing is what we believe to be the right balance right now",Positive
But think of this as kind of foray one in terms of injecting growth and investment into supporting longer-term sustainable growth for the CEB contract value business,Neutral
"It certainly doesn't hurt as a conversation starter around, hey, you read about the Equifax breach last night or last week, rather, we have great stuff that can actually help you out, that's absolutely true",Positive
"Toni, it's Craig",Neutral
"So, about a 11% down was worth roughly $1 million",Neutral
"Yeah, Toni",Neutral
I think two things there,Neutral
"Yeah, so we saw acceleration from Q1 to Q2 up to 15% growth",Positive
"We stated 15% growth in Q3. And that, as we talked about a little bit, as we described our Q4 guidance, that is flowing through",Positive
That's the bulk of it,Neutral
Thanks Meg,Neutral
"As discussed, while our overall performance in Q2 was impacted by tough markets and the external factors I discussed last quarter, we continue to drive growth in our higher margin businesses and align our cost structure with the future HPE operating structure",Positive
revenue from continuing operations of $7.4 billion was down 5% adjusted for divestitures and currency driven by declines in software and tier 1 server sales,Negative
"From a macro perspective, we continue to see competitive pricing and a challenging commodities environment",Negative
HPE's performance in the U.S,Neutral
was stable excluding tier 1 servers as core servers improved and strong growth and networking was offset by a challenging storage market,Negative
although strong results in Germany helped the region,Positive
"Turning to margins, gross margin of 33.8% was down 200 basis points year-over-year and down 240 basis points sequentially",Negative
Non-GAAP operating profit of 7.8% was down 130 basis points year-over-year and down 270 basis points sequentially,Negative
Now turning to the results by business,Neutral
"In the enterprise group, revenue was down 7% in a tough market with continued commodities pricing pressure",Negative
"However, EG revenue grew slightly year-over-year when adjusted for tier 1 sales, driven by several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio",Positive
Aruba was up 27%,Neutral
Three part all-flash arrays were up 33%,Neutral
High-performance compute grew more than 40% with SGI in over 20% organically and technology services was up 3%,Positive
These are some of the areas of the business that we expect to drive profit expansion and topline growth for the future of HPE,Positive
"That said, operating margins were down 300 basis points year-over-year and 390 basis points sequentially to 8.8%",Negative
The margin declines can be broken out into three categories,Negative
These stranded costs are most acute immediately following the spinoff and we will quickly work them down to zero on a run rate basis by the end of the fiscal year,Negative
"Second, we have the short-term dilution impact from our recent acquisitions of SGI, Nimble and SimpliVity",Negative
Server revenue declined 14% primarily due to tier 1 as we deemphasize the category to focus on more profitable areas,Positive
"While we'll continue to focus on strengthening our go-to-market, integrating the recent acquisitions into your portfolio and driving targeted organic R&D, we are making solid progress since our stabilization in more profitable core servers, which declined less than 1%",Positive
Storage revenue declined 13% driven by continued challenging markets and tight SSD supplies,Negative
Our all-flash array growth accelerated this quarter and was up 33% year-over-year and results were still meaningfully impacted by SSD supply constraints,Positive
"Networking revenue grew 14% driven by Aruba Wireless Solution, which was up over 30%",Positive
Aruba was especially strong in North America with over 100 new logo wins and is expected to take more than two point of share worldwide adjusted for H3C,Positive
HPE's campus and branch switching business delivered mid-single digit growth demonstrating that it's combination with Aruba is working,Positive
Orders also grew year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter giving us strong confidence that TS will grow through the current fiscal year,Positive
We saw a strong order performance in consulting with particular strength in network and data center as well as commercial media solutions,Positive
"HPE Financial Services revenue grew 11%, its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, driven primarily by one-time lease conversions and an increase in operating lease mix",Positive
We've been pleased with the performance of financial services as it has become strategically more important to our customers as they increasingly value flexible consumption models,Positive
"Operating profit declined 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%, reflecting the increased operating lease mix",Negative
Software revenue was down 9% as declines in license and professional services more than offset growth in SaaS as the team works through a transition to Micro Focus,Negative
The cash conversion cycle now reflects the removal of enterprise services and was negative 12 days down one day sequentially,Negative
The software Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned and we continue to anticipate the transaction closing on September 1. We are making progress removing stranded costs and continue to anticipate a $0.06 diluted EPS impact in fiscal year '17 with all costs eliminated on a run rate basis by the end of the year,Positive
"Turning to our outlook, the seasonality of EPS will be more backend loaded given the stranded costs and M&A dilution will be worked down over time",Negative
"With that we expect Q3 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.24 to $0.28. From a GAAP perspective, we expect Q3 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.02 to positive $0.02. For the full-year, we are holding to our prior fiscal year '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook of $1.46 to $1.56. From a GAAP perspective, we expect fiscal year '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.03 to $0.07. Finally, turning to cash flow outlook, as previously mentioned, we anticipate paying DXC approximately $300 million in the second half for the ES payroll ending March 31. Also, we expect to pay DXC an incremental $300 million in the second half for agreed-upon balance sheet adjustments, primarily related to working capital",Negative
Now let's open it up for questions,Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
Sure Sherri,Neutral
"So, when you move from Q2 to Q3, that's relatively flat and basically what you're seeing there is the impact and the pressure from the stranded costs, from the short-term dilution of the acquisitions and some of the commodity cost pressures",Negative
The first one is just typical seasonality,Neutral
"If you just think about the software business as an example, Q4 is typically much higher than Q3. The second component of it is as we eliminate the stranded costs and as we get right size the cost envelopes around the acquisitions, that will be favorable in Q4 and then thirdly, is a $200 million to $300 million of cost out",Neutral
So that's why you see that ramp up in Q4.,Neutral
"We don't really give BU specific guidance on the margins, but yeah, I would say servers is driving a component of that and again the way I think about it as we talked about in the prepared remarks is there's a component of that that's structural",Neutral
"Again, most of that is memory",Neutral
Okay,Neutral
I think there are a few questions in there,Neutral
"So, let me see what I can do",Neutral
"So, I think to your point, we did on the Q1 call, we did think that revenues would stabilize",Neutral
There is some FX impact,Neutral
DRAM is causing a pressure point,Neutral
"Obviously, that's why we took our guide down, but if you look at memory costs in 2Q, they're actually up another 10%",Negative
"Now to get to your question on product margins, yes if you look at TS, the good news with TS is it's been very stable over the years not only from a revenue perspective but also for a margin perspective",Positive
"Now as I think about how do we progress going forward and to Meg's point earlier, we think 2Q is going to be a low point and basically that's driven by the fact that one, we're going to work out the stranded costs",Neutral
"Again, I think a third of that will come out in Q3 and two thirds of that will come out in Q4. So, as we take those cost out and the other thing that we should get is we should get a mix lift",Neutral
"As synergy comes online, as we continue to grow particularly if you think about high-performance compute and some of the areas of the portfolio, again excluding tier 1, from a year-over-year component, we would expect to return back to growth in the latter part of the year",Neutral
"So again, I think our strategy is still the same",Neutral
"We are going to continue to focus on organic investments because where we do that well and we do it right, it's good for customers, it's good for shareholders, it's good for partners, it's good for employees",Positive
We always continue to look at share buybacks,Neutral
"So, the way we think about M&A again as being very consistent and it's all around complementary IP, where we can leverage our distribution and drive profitable growth",Positive
"So, it's all returns based",Neutral
"So, if you look at Remain Co",Neutral
"Now obviously we took that number down or we took our number down in total by $0.12 that was in Q1 that was driven by some of the FX pressures we saw, some of the commodity cost pressures we saw as well some execution issues that we were working through",Negative
I would take that down to roughly $2 billion of normalized free cash flow to reflect the earnings pressure,Negative
"Yes, sure",Neutral
"So, from a converged perspective, I think the converged part of the portfolio was down roughly 8% and traditional was down roughly 20% and then from a material perspective, really the supply constraints are much more around SSD and again as that market is very tight right now, we're getting our fair share of supplies, but given the complexity of our broad product portfolio, we're finding it challenging to what we call demand shift",Negative
"And then from a cost structure perspective ballpark, I think roughly half of that $200 million to $300 million is more of the discretionary type stuff like policies, like travel and then the other half is labor related and within that labor piece, I'd break it out into two components",Neutral
"So, when you think about the cost to do those things, there really is no cost to do that and then there's the remaining 25% that would be more structural and that's why we're evaluating the restructuring that we have in 2018 employing forward",Neutral
"Good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
Thank you for joining us on the call,Neutral
Today I would like to cover a couple of things,Neutral
So letâ€™s dive right in,Neutral
We saw strong momentum across key segments of the portfolio,Positive
"From a profitability perspective, we made good progress on improving our operating margins as we began executing the cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter",Positive
With the strong revenue performance and improved profitability we were able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 above our previously provided outlook of $0.24 to $0.28 per share,Positive
Free cash flow was also strong at over $400 million in the quarter putting us in a good position to achieve our full year outlook,Positive
"Turning to the business performance, while we have seen some improvement in the market overall, our strong Q3 performance was driven primarily by better execution and a compelling portfolio resulting in solid growth across key businesses",Positive
"For example, core server revenue was up 13% year-over-year and we expect to gain share in calendar Q2. Since its launch, late last year, Synergy is experiencing very strong momentum with over 600 customers to-date",Positive
Hyper converged is core to our strategy of making hybrid IT simple for our customers and we saw over 200% growth in Q3 although off a small base,Positive
"All-Flash storage grew 30% year-over-year driven by Nimble, which exceeded both revenue and profit plans for the quarter",Positive
Aruba continues to perform exceptionally well,Neutral
Weâ€™ve now seen five consecutive quarters of order and revenue growth in consulting as we put more emphasis on advisory and transformed services post the ES split,Positive
This deal delivered approximately $9 billion in value and I am confident that this was a great move for the new Micro Focus and for HPE,Positive
"While we work to create the strong internal structure, we cannot lose sight of innovation",Positive
"And today, more than ever, we are able to make focused investments in the areas where we see the most opportunity for growth in the future",Positive
We are already seeing growth in our Aruba Wireless Connectivity business driven by IOT and we are seeing significant emerging interest in our highly differentiated edge compute business known as Edgeline driven by these same trends,Positive
"As the amount of data grows, we have a strong roadmap to memory-driven computing based on our machine research project that will exponentially extend these capabilities in the future",Positive
But Tim will provide a bit more color on that,Neutral
So thank you to them,Neutral
"And with that, I will turn it over to Tim",Neutral
"Yes, sure",Neutral
There has been some press,Neutral
"Itâ€™s very disruptive, that relies on a community of drivers just like Ebay relies on a community of sellers and the growth prospects reminded me of Ebay in its early days and as you know, I am also an investor in Uber and â€“ but, in the end that wasnâ€™t the right thing",Positive
"Yes, Iâ€™ll take that and Tim can follow on",Neutral
"There was also some improvement frankly in the overall market and in all â€“ or easy compares in Q3 than they were in Q1 and Q2. But I also have to say the portfolio that we have worked hard to create that we have pivoted over the last couple of years, that is in faster growing more profitable areas in the markets is starting to kick in and you can see that in High Performance Compute, you can see it in synergies momentum that is not only, the actual product of Synergy, but itâ€™s actually accelerating the core blade business",Positive
And then across Aruba continues to do very well,Neutral
And interestingly on Aruba in the U.S,Neutral
We are going to continue to face some headwinds from Tier-1s that was down versus Q3. But we are feeling much better about that core business and you really need to think about this as stabilizing the core transactional rack and tower business while we pivot the portfolio to higher margin and higher growth segments in the marketplace and thatâ€™s working,Neutral
"And so, I feel good about our execution",Neutral
I feel good about what we can control,Neutral
We are excited about Azureâ€™s stack on-prem,Neutral
Let me give you a little context on that,Neutral
Think about platforms and SKUs and options,Neutral
The old 80-20 rule applies,Neutral
Reducing the number of markets that we operate in to prioritize the customers and the countries that are driving the vast majority of the business today and weâ€™ll drive almost all the growth,Positive
So this is the kind of thing we are doing,Neutral
So the UK is not one of our stronger markets,Neutral
Itâ€™s a very important market for us,Neutral
So we are excited about that,Neutral
So we are cautiously optimistic,Neutral
We are executing a lot better here,Neutral
Thanks to EMEA and APJ and Latin America,Neutral
We are executing a lot better here than we have in the past with the stronger portfolio,Positive
"Cloudline, you had a question about Cloudline",Neutral
And so we are evaluating that right now,Neutral
"Okay, letâ€™s see",Neutral
"So, youâ€™d like to know the number",Neutral
"Yes, so, I think actually, I think did a very good job of getting to All-Flash early with 3PAR and then of course Nimble and then the two competitors that you mentioned actually showed up with an All-Flash product quite recently and theyâ€™ve been able to mine their installed base which we understood would happen",Neutral
I canâ€™t give you an estimated growth rate of All-Flash,Positive
"So, I donâ€™t know whether this will continue at a 30% growth rate, but it will be at least double-digits, I think for the foreseeable future, this is a fundamental trend in the datacenter",Neutral
I think itâ€™s roughly 10% to 15% of our revenue in the United States and we have an excellent position there,Neutral
There would be a speed bump there,Neutral
There is two things that differentiate Aruba,Neutral
One is security,Neutral
There is also interesting things built into Aruba,Neutral
The other thing is asset tagging,Neutral
"So, listen, we compete hard every day there",Neutral
"So, listen, we expect that to continue",Neutral
"I think that the Aruba team would also tell you they have benefited by part of being a part of Hewlett Packard, because when they were Aruba people loved the product, but some big companies were a little bit hesitant to sign on to a small independent start-up while part of HPE, they know we will stand behind Aruba and that has totally helped the revenue trajectory of Aruba",Neutral
"Yes, so listen, we think HPE Next will have positive revenue accelerators and it really goes to two major initiatives, one is how do we make decisions on accountability much closer to the customer",Neutral
"And then I mentioned, probably like most companies, a small number of countries account for the vast majority of revenue and profit and will account for the growth in our industry over the next five to ten years and we want to make sure we are allocating the resources correctly to the largest countries with the countries that have the most growth and profit potential for us",Positive
"And so, I think that actually will accelerate",Neutral
As you can imagine a 1% increase in the United States dwarf just about if you think of the long tail of countries that dwarfs the revenue in those long tail of countries,Neutral
So those are some of the initiatives that I think by extension will impact revenue to the positive,Neutral
"We do, actually we really do",Neutral
Thank you very much,Neutral
"From a much stronger position, we then looked at our portfolio and made a number of strategic decisions to further sharpen our focus and accelerate performance",Positive
This unique approach has put us in a strong position to capitalize on the second largest IT market in the world,Positive
We also made a number of strategic additions to strengthen our portfolio in key growth areas,Positive
These companies are all in growth markets and we are accelerating their performance by leveraging our go-to-market channels,Positive
The industry recognizes the progress we have made,Neutral
"By fixing, improving and reposition the company I joined, HPE has worked its way into a strong competitive position ready to drive the next phase of shareholder value and you are starting to see the payoff in our results",Positive
In Q4 FY â€˜17 we grew revenue 5% year-over-year capping a full year FY â€˜17 where we grew the top line 1% when adjusted for currency and divestitures,Positive
"Services grew 3% in Q4 and our investments in key growth areas like the intelligent edge, high-performance compute and all-flash storage are clearly paying off",Positive
HPC was up 28% in Q4 and 37% for the year,Neutral
"I am very pleased that we saw no disruption in Q4. In fact, HPE Next has galvanized the entire company around our vision to drive tremendous value for customers, partners and ultimately shareholders and all of this is being driven by the strong leadership team we have in place",Positive
But our vision doesnâ€™t end there,Neutral
"Second, we power the intelligent edge",Neutral
"We have highly differentiated offerings in this area that are helping customers drive a revolution across their business from the factory floor to the retail store, whether it is with our wired and wireless connectivity offerings from Aruba that allow customers to securely connect edge environments and drive new experiences for their customers, employees and new revenue streams for their bottom line, our Edgeline Converged Systems that bring storage and compute directly to the source of the data that needs to be analyzed or our universal IoT software platform that seamlessly integrates data from disparate IoT systems at massive scale",Neutral
We have laid out a strong foundation for a prosperous future and now is the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins,Positive
"Yes, so â€“ itâ€™s Meg, the storage revenue was up 5% driven by the Nimble acquisition and as you said the all flash arrays grew 16% with Nimble was up over 80%",Positive
"So a good performance overall, but as Tim mentioned 3PAR performance was soft due to I think a very tough competitive environment in the â€“ in the mid-range and then some sales challenges in the United States",Neutral
So we are taking action,Neutral
and we are fixing it,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
"No, I think you have got this exactly right",Neutral
"Servers had another strong quarter outside of Tier 1. Remember, we had quite a large Tier 1 service provider business that had a fair amount of revenue, but not much profit associated with it, but outside that, it grew 6% and I think that was execution, market improvement and some good traction in our higher value offerings",Positive
"So in addition to stabilizing core rack and tower we are pivoting hard to our value and growth offerings like HPC, Synergy, SimpliVity, etcetera",Positive
"So, why donâ€™t you take ex-Tier 1 server growth and I will take the other question",Positive
Great,Neutral
So letâ€™s stay tuned on Skylake,Neutral
We have got a very good leadership bench,Neutral
And Antonio is a deep technologist,Neutral
He has been with the company 22 years,Neutral
"So, I just think itâ€™s the right thing",Neutral
We have created a lot of shareholder value here,Neutral
"The other thing Iâ€™d add to that Toni is this strategy to pivot to the value in the growth segments of our portfolio is absolutely critical because, just a mix shift of a couple of percent actually increases the operating margin",Positive
"And we anticipate that that will happen as we realign the sales force, as we focus marketing on the value and growth segment and we realize the potential of â€“ of the portfolio",Positive
"I would say the competitive pricing environment is maybe slightly mitigated, but it would be hard for me to gauge that, because it varies by country, it varies by product line and it shifts from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter",Neutral
"So while I would say overall, thereâ€™s been some mitigation in that pricing environment I would not say it is universal and weâ€™re not counting on that for the delivery of our operating margin in 2018. And then DRAM pricing appears to now be leveling out and you talk to people in the industry, it appears that supply is now beginning to match demand there is going to be more supply I think from the key vendors of memory and so weâ€™ll see what happens",Neutral
"We are not counting by the way on to deliver our results on a drop in DRAM pricing, weâ€™re also not counting on another 15%, 20% increase in DRAM pricing, but we feel pretty good about the way where we are and I got a lot of confidence that we are going to hit our $1.15 to $1.20 and the 11% to 12% operating margin",Neutral
"Yes, good question",Neutral
So we feel pretty good about that,Neutral
Outside the storage challenge in the U.S,Neutral
"was largely around not enough specialists in the field and frankly we need more scale in our storage sales here and combining Nimble and 3PAR under Keegan Riley, I think is going to really help here",Neutral
"Yes, let me answer the strategy question",Neutral
"So, the strategy will remain entirely consistent",Neutral
It was crafted by Antonio and I,Neutral
he has been leading HPE Next,Neutral
And we are completely aligned on the strategy,Neutral
"And I think you mentioned that but just itâ€™s important to note that the number of these acquisitions when we acquired them, were actually losing money and so we have now worked that of and I think virtually all of them will be accretive in 2018.",Neutral
"So, we canâ€™t",Neutral
What I would say is I think the sales team is hitting the ground running on storage,Neutral
"So, I think you will naturally see him pivot harder to storage than perhaps some of our earlier sales leaders",Neutral
Yes,Neutral
"With regard to acquisitions, you know what, when I came to this company I think we had a somewhat less than stellar reputation on acquisitions",Neutral
"And I think the acquisition profile that had been successful for us whether itâ€™s Aruba or SimpliVity, etcetera is the following",Neutral
"Is there a complementary technology to one that we already own that can benefit by being â€“ by leveraging our distribution channels, listen Aruba has accelerated its growth rate under HP, because we can introduce the Aruba product line to customers",Positive
"But I think you have seen Tim and I would be very disciplined about acquisitions, returns based by the company right and have a very clear business case, whether itâ€™s cost take-out or acceleration",Neutral
And I will be on the board to make sure they do,Neutral
"Yes, so you are right",Neutral
"Aruba, both wired and wireless, has had a really great fiscal year â€˜17. And the thesis when we bought Aruba was the wireless would actually drag along the wired and that has actually turned out to be the case, particularly in the United States, where the wired portfolio had a great â€˜17 in a particularly strong Q4. Increasingly, we see demand for Aruba on a flexible capacity model",Positive
"And just like any other product that we sell, we are happy to do a flexible capacity model pay-as-you-go, annuity-based revenue stream for people who want to buy that way for Aruba",Positive
"So, we think we have a competitive advantage",Neutral
And I think itâ€™s going along nicely,Neutral
I think we can do better,Neutral
"Thank you, Diana",Neutral
"With a strong start to our 2017 fiscal year, we continued to build on our track record of delivering on all of our financial commitments with discipline, focus, and execution",Positive
"We've also made solid progress in positioning the business for long-term growth, and we accomplished this amidst a market backdrop that remained highly competitive",Positive
"And we grew net revenue by 4% year over year to $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth in Personal Systems",Positive
"We are delivering strong results because we are executing on our reinvention and driving our strategy to protect our core, prioritize growth, and invest in the future",Positive
"This is a story of innovation and execution in delivering revenue, margin expansion, and market share growth year-over-year",Positive
Personal Systems revenue grew 10% year-over-year with operating profit improvement,Positive
"The last time we saw this level of revenue growth was in 2014, triggered by the XP refresh cycle",Positive
"In contrast, this growth was triggered by HP's innovation engine and ability to outperform the market",Positive
I'm particularly pleased with the balanced results in Personal Systems across geographies and product segments,Positive
We delivered double-digit revenue growth in all three regions as well as in notebooks and workstations,Positive
Our focus on segmenting the market opportunities and addressing strategic pockets of growth with differentiated products has resulted in profitable share gains in both consumer and commercial,Positive
"In calendar quarter four, we beat the PC market unit growth by 8.5 points, outperforming all key competitors and achieving our highest ever worldwide market share position of 21.8%",Positive
This is the way we like to win,Neutral
"Without a doubt, our momentum can be attributed to the strongest portfolio in our history",Positive
And one key point of differentiation is security,Neutral
"Now turning to Printing, we made great progress in stabilizing the business",Positive
"Hardware revenue grew year over year in constant currency with units up 6%, bolstered by our new Sprocket product that is helping create a new category in mobile printing",Positive
"The overall market was a bit better than expected, with slight unit growth year-over-year in calendar quarter four",Positive
"Due to our hard work taking cost out, we were well positioned to take advantage of this market upside and placed more positive NPV units",Positive
"We also saw momentum in strategic contractual areas, with strong results in Managed Print Services and continued good momentum in Instant Ink enrollment",Positive
"You'll recall one of our key growth initiatives in Printing is Graphics, which delivered strong performance once again, with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency for the 14th consecutive quarter",Positive
"We saw strong hardware growth in Indigo, large-format industrial, and PageWide XL, as well as growth in Graphics supplies and services",Positive
"Among the many strong custom deployments is LSC Communications, a global leader in print services, who is deploying our PageWide web press to support its growing client demand, having more than 3 billion pages of capacity in its printing platform",Positive
"With our continued progress this quarter, we remain confident that supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of fiscal 2017. Consistent with that, total supplies revenue was down just 2% year-over-year in constant currency",Positive
"As we always say, it's all about supplies, and we continued to drive a number of initiatives within the Four Box Model to return this revenue stream to growth",Positive
"We see plenty of momentum, innovation, and opportunity for us to capture in both the near and long-term and are aggressively pursuing profitable share and targeting strategic growth segments",Positive
"Thanks, Katy",Neutral
Let me tackle it,Neutral
"Listen, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we remain confident that supplies revenue growth in constant currency will stabilize by the end of 2017, consistent with our Four Box Model analytics that we see",Positive
And that's what we said we would do,Neutral
It's like a 22-point spread there,Neutral
We obviously invested in marketing,Neutral
"We invested in units, and there was some currency",Neutral
"The innovation portfolio is as strong as it's ever been, more than 23 awards that we won at CES",Positive
"Okay, great",Neutral
"More broadly, we think it's all about innovation",Neutral
"And as I mentioned in my initial remarks, the growth that we saw in the PC business wasn't as a result of one event",Positive
It wasn't like an XP refresh cycle,Neutral
"It was off the back of really strong innovation right across the portfolio, the values that the customer sees and the little sprinkles of magic that Ron and the team are adding to the product portfolio",Positive
We have to be excellent in the core,Neutral
"We have to continue to search for those pockets of growth as we segment the market, like commercial mobility, create categories like Sprout and x3. All of it has to be anchored in megatrends that we see changing in the market",Positive
"The reception has been broadly positive on a number of dimensions, firstly off the back of our own home-grown innovation with the PageWide array and the ability to take that into the A3 line of products",Positive
"In addition to that, there's batteries and LCDs",Neutral
We have long-term agreements with many of them,Neutral
That doesn't happen overnight,Neutral
Thanks,Neutral
"And in addition to that, it would be the full execution of our strategy, not only in the core, but as well as the growth",Positive
"There's A3. Think about that $55 billion market where we have less than a 4% market share today, continuing our ramp of Graphics and commercial mobility, and we've only just begun on 3D Printing where we placed those first units and revenue recced them, which is even more exciting",Neutral
And that strategy is anchored in time horizons,Neutral
The core is the here and now,Neutral
I think this quarter can best be characterized as relentless execution and innovation that delivered really strong results,Positive
"It's a consecutive quarter of growth, so this is the second quarter in a row of growth and solid performance",Positive
"I'm Steve Fieler, Head of Treasury for HP, Inc",Neutral
com,Neutral
"For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions",Positive
"For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K",Positive
"And now, I will hand it over to Dion",Neutral
"Thank you, Steve",Neutral
I'm very pleased with our quarterly performance,Neutral
It was a breakthrough quarter where we delivered year-over-year growth in both Personal Systems and Print,Positive
"Weâ€™re taking profitable share, out-executing our competitors and delivering some of the best innovation, design and execution in HP's history",Positive
We are strengthening our core business and delivering our milestones in our growth and future initiatives,Positive
I'm proud of the results this quarter,Neutral
Let me talk through a few of the highlights,Neutral
"We grew net revenue by 7% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, driven by growth in Personal Systems and Print â€“ the first time weâ€™ve delivered growth in both segments during the same quarter since Q4 2010. We delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the first half of the fiscal year",Positive
"Looking at the business segment performance, Personal Systems continued to deliver and demonstrate how playing our game drives strong results",Positive
The team once again drove revenue growth year-over-year and market share expansion,Positive
"This is a great example of how segmenting market opportunities, innovating and executing can yield amazing results",Positive
"For the second consecutive quarter, Personal Systems revenue grew by 10% year-over-year",Positive
"And importantly, once again, this is broad-based growth across all three regions, both consumer and commercial audiences and in notebook and workstation categories",Positive
"In calendar quarter one, we beat the year-over-year PC market unit growth by 12 points, once again outperforming all key competitors and the market as a whole",Positive
Our ability to gain profitable share is one of the true measures of success,Positive
"Shifting to Printing, Enrique and his team had a breakthrough quarter, with strong performance across multiple dimensions â€“ total revenue, supplies revenue, units, market share and operating profit",Positive
"Printing revenue grew 2% year-over-year, with both hardware and supplies revenue growing in the same quarter for the first time since Q2 of 2011. Units also grew year-over-year as did our market share, while delivering operating profit expansion",Positive
"With solid progress on our productivity initiatives, which lowers our overall cost structure, we remain better positioned to competitively price and place more units with a positive NPV",Positive
"Due in part to our continued operational progress, hardware units were up 4% in Q2, our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth",Positive
We continue to grow faster than the market with year-over-year profitable share gains in both our home and office businesses,Positive
"I'm pleased that our supplies performance strengthened this quarter, with revenue up 2% year-over-year",Positive
"In addition to improvements in our core Printing business, we have built momentum in strategic growth areas",Positive
Our Graphics business delivered another strong performance with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency for the 15th consecutive quarter,Positive
We saw balanced hardware revenue growth across the portfolio as well as in graphic supplies and services,Positive
"Similarly, we saw growth in contractual printing with continued increases in new total contract value for management services",Positive
"This month, at Rapid, the largest 3D printing conference in the world, we announced a series of important milestones, including a reseller program with more than 30 partners, more than a dozen 3D reference and experience centers across North America and Europe, a growing roster of manufacturing service bureaus and product development customers implementing HP jet fusion 3D printing systems for production and new applications, and we expanded our Open Materials platform to include new partners like Henkel, a global leader in high-performance adhesive technologies",Neutral
"To summarize, Q2 was a breakthrough quarter for us, with strong year-over-year performance across our segments and regions",Positive
"However, our work never ends",Neutral
Change is a constant in our business,Neutral
"And to us, change equals opportunity",Neutral
"Thanks, Dion",Neutral
We've continued the momentum from our strong first half and I'm very pleased with our third quarter results,Positive
"Sequentially, gross margin was down 60 basis points, driven by an unfavorable Print mix and a higher sequential growth in Personal Systems",Positive
"Sequentially, operating expenses were down 1%",Negative
"With a non-GAAP tax rate of 22% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.43. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $46 million and acquisition-related charges of $40 million, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits of $34 million, tax indemnification credits of $10 million and the related tax impact on these charges",Neutral
This was our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth,Positive
"These efforts have helped us sustain revenue momentum, deliver consistently across each region, and drive strong market share as an end result",Positive
"We also achieved strong results by product category, with notebooks up 16%, desktops up 5% and workstations up 11% year-over-year",Positive
"We delivered 3.7% operating margin in the quarter, which is up 0.5 points quarter to quarter, above historical seasonality, and down 0.7 points year-over-year",Negative
"We have increased pricing globally and have continued to see positive mix shifts in the business, both of which have helped improve operating margin sequentially",Positive
"As noted previously, our total unit growth includes HP Sprocket, our handheld photo printer",Positive
We remain optimistic about our print growth businesses,Positive
Our A3 business is off to a strong start since launching its new product lineup in Q2 and we're excited about the opportunity to be a disruptive new entrant in this $55 billion market,Positive
"As Dion highlighted, both graphics and managed print services continued to grow revenue year-over-year and we have the opportunity to increase our growth rates",Positive
"Now, moving to Q3 supplies performance",Neutral
"The supplies growth was better than anticipated, driven by improving four-box model drivers",Positive
"As we described in the past, the way we look at supplies revenue growth operationally is to take our as-reported number and adjust for two things",Positive
"First, we look at constant currency growth",Positive
"In Q3 2016, reported supplies revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $225 million or eight points of growth",Positive
"Therefore, when you deduct the eight points against the 10% constant currency growth, net adjusted supplies growth for Q3 2017 was 2% year-over-year",Positive
"Looking forward to Q4 2017, we expect that our year-over-year supplies revenue growth will remain flat to slightly up when making similar operational adjustments for currency and then backing out approximately $225 million for the supply sales model channel inventory adjustment taken in Q4 of 2016. Print operating profit was 17.3% in the quarter, down 3.1 points year-over-year and down 10 basis points sequentially",Negative
"The positive margin impact of deducting certain marketing optimization software asset, offset by the negative impact of changing the supply sales model, plus productivity improvements year-over-year",Positive
"Excluding the one-time adjustments, we saw good operating profit dollar expansion year-over-year",Positive
"Now, turning to cash flow and capital allocation",Neutral
"The strong Q3 results were driven by Personal Systems revenue performance, which grew sequentially by over $700 million or 10%, well above historical norms",Positive
"As you know, since Personal Systems has a negative cash conversion cycle, the timing of cash flow is impacted either positively or negatively depending on its sequential revenue performance",Positive
"With this demand uncertainty, combined with our very strong Q3 revenue performance, we expect Personal Systems Q4 revenue to grow less than normal sequential seasonality",Positive
"Given our hedging strategy, we have rolling currency hedges, which extend into future quarters and, therefore, we do not expect a material tailwind from currency in Q4 2017. We will also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so",Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"So, everyone should join us then",Neutral
"So, from a growth perspective â€“ first off, it's a little bit tougher compare, right? So, if you actually look at what's happened to unit growth, kind of each of the quarters this year, each quarter, the previous year is a bit tougher",Positive
"So, I think that's part of what's going on",Neutral
"Sure, Katy",Neutral
We do expect it will grow sequentially,Neutral
"I think consumer revenue was up 14% year-over-year, even though we have done price increases",Neutral
"So, itâ€™s much more in the commercial space",Neutral
Dion mentioned that we had 6% share,Neutral
"So, Jim, let me take the second one first",Neutral
We have been outgrowing the market by quite a bit,Neutral
"And so, if there is a tailwind from currency in 2018, our expectation is that prices are going to have to come down pretty significantly to relieve some of the pressure that's building because we've been increasing prices this year",Negative
"And so, then it's going to be, ultimately, what is the total impact, it's going to be how many price declines do you have to do and what impact does that have on both revenue and EPS",Negative
It will be â€“ Q4 will be without Samsung,Neutral
"And so, that'll be a bit of a headwind",Neutral
"So, Shannon, I think it's a bit difficult",Neutral
We don't break out kind of that level of detail,Neutral
This is particularly true from a DRAM perspective,Neutral
"I think that with our great product lineup, we're certainly able to make the sales that we need to make in that space and get them off kind of the fence",Positive
"So, Rod, let's just make sure we're level set",Neutral
"Sorry, I haven't been focused on Q4 last year",Neutral
"I don't remember off the top of my head what happened last â€“ can we take that offline and I can look at that? And maybe even while we're talking here, I can look it up",Neutral
But I havenâ€™t focused on it,Neutral
Maybe we just mismodeled it in July,Neutral
"But just wanted to understand, in the October guidance, what you're thinking in terms of operating margins in OpEx?",Neutral
Iâ€™m sorry,Neutral
Can you say that again?,Neutral
"We have made great progress in our Printing business on our cost structure, and that is enabling us to go into the market and find opportunities that used to be negative NPV opportunities that are now positive NPV opportunities and we expect to take advantage of those opportunities",Positive
"Because the Personal Systems business has such a negative cash conversion cycle that when it grows â€“ its growth increases sequentially, you're going to see a fair amount of free cash flow",Positive
"Similarly, if the growth is less in the following â€“ in the next quarter sequentially, you're actually going to see a little bit of a reduction in free cash flow",Positive
"What we expect for this year is that we would do at least $3 billion in free cash flow, so making great progress on free cash flow, and that our cash conversion cycle would likely end the year at a minus 29 days, kind of in line with FY 2016's exit",Positive
"Thank you, Steve",Neutral
It was great to see so many of you at our recent Security Analyst Meeting here in Palo Alto,Neutral
"Our results today echo what you heard from us, HP is strong and getting stronger",Positive
"As I look at our performance in the quarter and for the full fiscal year, Iâ€™m pleased with our consistent execution, ability to grow revenue, generate cash flow, and invest in our future to create sustainable growth over time",Positive
"We committed to compete and win in our core, into new growth markets and natural adjacencies, and invest in our future where we can disrupt industries and create new categories",Positive
Let me review the highlights,Neutral
"We drove impressive topline growth with net revenue up 11% year-over-year to $13.9 billion including double-digit growth and share gains across the Americas, EMEA, and APJ",Positive
"We grew non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share year-over-year, delivering $0.44 for the quarter",Positive
"Now, let me turn to segment performance",Neutral
"In quarter four, Personal Systems had another stellar quarter, driving growth, gaining profitable share, and delivering impressive innovations",Positive
"Personal Systems net revenue grew 13% year-over-year, which came on top of last yearâ€™s 4% growth in quarter four",Positive
For the full year we grew 11% year-over-year with double-digit growth in each of the past four quarters,Positive
"We also saw consistent growth across product categories led by notebooks, and strong performance in desktops and workstations",Positive
Our regional leaders and sales partners are doing an incredible job of driving growth and delivering value for our customers,Positive
"In calendar quarter three, the overall PC market returned to year-over-year growth both in units and revenue",Positive
"We once again outperformed the PC unit market growth and increased our market share to 22.5%, up 1.2 points year-over-year",Positive
We are seeing strong wins by our channel partners and a healthy pipeline for the future,Positive
Shifting to Printing,Neutral
"This business continues to make significant progress with year-over-year growth in revenue, operating profit and market share",Positive
"In quarter four, total revenue was up 7% year-over-year with growth across all three geographic regions",Positive
"Quarter four supplies revenue grew again, demonstrating the huge progress weâ€™ve made with this business during the year",Positive
This is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth,Positive
"Together, we are building on more than 30 years of print leadership and innovation, and now we have an unmatched portfolio and amazing technologies that will enable us to drive growth over time",Positive
"As our two teams become one, we will preserve the best, the best talent, the best culture and the best technology to become better, stronger and faster",Positive
Weâ€™ve gained critical IP and now have a broad portfolio of laser and ink offerings that better positions us to attack the overall $55 billion A3 growth opportunity,Positive
And that also strengthens our A4 business,Neutral
2017 was a great year for 3D,Positive
"Weâ€™re growing the business, top line and bottom line, and generating strong cash flow",Positive
"The growth initiatives around A3, our graphics business, everything is a service which will obviously provide growth opportunities for us over the next two to three years and then further out into the future over the next five to ten years, the work weâ€™re doing around the most of computing and 3D printing, really crates an opportunity for long-term growth for our shareholders",Positive
We grew at 2.5-point premium to that,Neutral
"And thatâ€™s really off the back of strong innovation to this lineup, I think we have ever had, we are getting incredibly positive reviews consistently",Positive
"Itâ€™s a continuous transformation of the business to more profitable subcategories, finding where the heat is into the market and where we can get value for the innovation that we are creating",Positive
"And in quarter four, that paid off yet again",Neutral
"We saw topline -- strong topline growth, sequential growth in operating profit",Positive
We saw year-over-year share gains,Neutral
The channel inventory was well under control,Neutral
We aged inventory was well-managed,Neutral
"Firstly, the A3 market is a $55 billion market and we are underpenetrated in that market relative to the A4 market where we have very strong market leadership",Positive
"So, we have an extremely strong portfolio when you put our technology together with the Samsung technology now, HP technology in both the A4 and A3 spaces in Ink, in PageWide, and in Laser, the second reason is that we integrated it, the A3 and the A4 portfolio which really increases our managed print services capability, thereâ€™re certain customers and tenders that would come out, that had a requirement for a mixed deployment of both A3 and A4 and were often excluded from those A4 deals",Positive
"Thanks, Shannon",Neutral
"I would say, still very early days",Neutral
"As it relates to investments, we feel good about the investment choices ahead of us",Neutral
"And ultimately, generating profitable growth is what itâ€™s all about",Positive
Growth for just growth sake is not particularly fascinating,Positive
"I think segment by segment, weâ€™re demonstrating that those investments are good choices, investment systems, broadly in premium and specifically in gaming are great examples of investments that we made that are paying dividends right now",Positive
"3D printing has gone from a business that was nonexistent a year ago to a real business today, 65 channel partners around the globe in every single region and ecosystem that weâ€™ve developed, partners in Deloitte and Siemens, more than 50 materials partners that are starting to look at making materials for the platform, plus the technology announcements that we made at the Security and Analyst Meeting around a lower cost color platform and the technology announcements weâ€™ll make around metals in 2018. So, weâ€™re feeling good about our ability to execute in the core, in the growth areas that we outlined, as well as the future",Neutral
We donâ€™t break it down at a segment level,Neutral
"I would just say that this has been a material business for us thatâ€™s grown up over the last 18 months from nothing to a sizable portion, not only in terms of revenue but the gross margin that it drives, as well as the halo effect that it has on the overall brand, which I think is lifting our premium segment as well as every other segment that we had within the PC business",Neutral
"So, we like being in this business and we see the growth continuing",Positive
"Weâ€™re leading in our core markets, weâ€™re entering new growth markets and natural adjacencies and at the same time investing in the future",Positive
Weâ€™ve never been more competitive,Neutral
We remain humble and focused,Neutral
We think itâ€™s been a great year of reinvention and weâ€™re just getting started,Positive
Have a great Thanksgiving,Neutral
"Thanks, Brian",Neutral
2016 was a record year for Intel and 2017 is off to a strong start,Positive
Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion,Positive
"Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year over year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program",Negative
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance,Neutral
Client ASPs were up 7% year over year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong,Positive
"This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the Client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations",Positive
"The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year over year",Negative
"Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year over year driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business",Positive
"Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year over year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending",Negative
"Our Memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year over year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply",Positive
We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations,Positive
"Operating profit was $92 million, flat year over year after adjusting for acquisition related impacts",Negative
Now let me turn to guidance,Neutral
"First, some context",Neutral
"First, while we see strong momentum and Client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third party analysts",Positive
"We feel great about our annual cadence of product innovations with new product launches planned this year including Skylake for data center, eighth generation core, 64-tier 3D NAND SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line",Positive
"Second, we continued to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply higher demand levels",Positive
"We expect our spending as a percent of revenue to be down 2 points in the first half of the year versus last year, as we make solid progress in increasing efficiency in the company",Positive
"We are already seeing an impact, with our growth-oriented businesses up double digits collectively as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud",Positive
"With that, let me turn it over to Mark",Neutral
"Yeah, the only thing I would add, Brian, is with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full-year revenue to be up $0.5 billion, versus where we were 90 days ago, and I would say one of the contributors to that is how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year",Positive
Yes,Neutral
"And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was over the next three years, low single digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income",Positive
"Against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term",Positive
"Yeah, and the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter",Positive
"As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will, particularly because the modem will have a relatively easy comp",Positive
"So that's a contributor to growth in the first half, and as Brian said, the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year, but given the product we have, we feel relatively good about where we are",Neutral
"Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digit and at the lower end of that range of the 40% to 45%",Positive
So 7 points of the 9% decline are simply a result of how we allocate cost to the business segments,Negative
"I think in terms of going through the course of the year, the things that are going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year",Positive
So it's in line with our long-term expectations,Neutral
No change,Neutral
"Our outlook for 2017, no change",Neutral
"It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs, but you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half",Neutral
"So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs",Negative
"And then the third thing, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business",Positive
"I guess what I'm trying to understand is, should we be thinking of CapEx this year as sort of the new norm with rising capital intensity, investments in the Memory business, maybe optionality around foundry? Or is the $12 billion this year sort of something that we should think about as being an above trend or particularly high spending year? Any color on that would be helpful",Neutral
One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down,Negative
So that's all baked in,Neutral
I don't know if it's rounding or not,Neutral
"I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through at an additional $0.05 of EPS, so we feel great about that",Positive
ASPs will improve for Data Center,Neutral
And the fast growth of Memory and modem will have a negative mix impact on gross margins,Positive
"Thanks, Mark",Neutral
"We beat the expectations we set in April, primarily as a result of stronger desktop and notebook microprocessor volume, and set a second quarter revenue record",Positive
"We're executing well to our priorities, and after adjusting for the McAfee transaction, revenue grew 14% year over year while non-GAAP operating margin grew 30%",Positive
"With industry-leading products and strong first half results, we're on a clear path for another record year",Positive
"I outlined our top four priorities for the year in support of that strategy: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs",Positive
The Data Center business grew 9% in Q2 and remains on track to high single digit growth for the year,Positive
"Strong public cloud growth continued, with revenue up 35%",Positive
"Cloud and comm service provider together are the growth engine in the data center, and together now make up nearly 60% of DCG's revenue",Positive
"Using Xeon Scalable, our customers have already achieved over 50 third-party verified performance world records and are seeing more than 1.6x performance increase over our prior generation product across a wide range of real world workloads",Positive
And we'll be shipping our first 10-nanometer products near the end of the year beginning with a lower volume SKU and followed by multiple SKUs and a volume ramp in the first half of 2018. We've seen some modest improvements in the PC consumption but we continue to expect a mid single digit TAM decline for the full year,Negative
"As I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to make great progress with our wireless ecosystem, laying the groundwork for 5G, and starting in 2018, Intel will partner on what is expected to be the first 5G showcase at the Olympic games",Positive
"We saw strong growth across all four, leading to a 26% increase in revenue",Positive
I'm excited to welcome the Mobileye team to Intel,Neutral
"Our memory business grew 58% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record",Positive
"This will be a big part of our overall supply growth in the second half, which we expect to be greater than 20%",Positive
The combination of strong execution and favorable market conditions is accelerating our path to profitability,Positive
Core NAND returned to profitability this quarter ahead of our earlier estimate and we expect it to remain profitable for the balance of the year,Positive
We also now expect the entire NSG segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018 versus our prior end of 2018 target,Positive
"Lastly, our FPGA business was down 5% over last year on weaker data center and comms sectors, but remains on track to our mid single digit growth target for the full year, with broad reacceleration in the second half across markets, including the Data Center segment",Positive
We're also seeing strong adoption of our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs,Positive
"To sum it up, I'm very pleased with our progress, and I'm more confident than ever in Intel's future and growth",Positive
"Based on our strong first half and higher expectations for the PC business and the expected close of Mobileye, we're raising our full-year revenue forecast from $60 billion to $61.3 billion and our non-GAAP EPS forecast from $2.85 to $3.00. We continue to see intense competition across our businesses",Positive
"The competition makes us stronger, and we're ready for it",Positive
"We now expect spending as a percent of revenue to decline about 160 basis points versus last year, bringing it below 34%, on track to the 30% goal we're committed to, to hit by 2020. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Bob",Negative
"Thanks, Blayne, for the question",Neutral
We think the data center continues to be just a great growth engine for the company,Positive
And you saw the 9% growth this quarter,Positive
So first wanted to lay that groundwork,Neutral
It declined at about 11%,Neutral
So we expect that trend to continue,Neutral
We don't need any big shifts in those trends to really get to that high single digit growth rate for the data center,Positive
We talked about Xeon Scalable,Neutral
The initial reaction has been extremely positive,Neutral
You see the cloud applications,Neutral
Sure,Neutral
And so that's what you see as the driver for the rest of the profitability growth as we go into next year,Positive
"So it's 64-tier products on traditional NAND, the ramp-out of Fab 68, and then the real startup and continuation in getting the rest of the products qualified on 3D XPoint is what gets us â€“ everything profitable next year",Positive
"In fact, there's not going to be a major shift",Neutral
It's going be in the high single-digit decline,Neutral
I think you'll see quarters like Q2 that was 11%,Neutral
You'll see quarters like Q1 that were 3% or 4%,Neutral
"I think we'll also see, we still again, talking to our partners, thinking that mid-20% for cloud growth, but I think we'll see quarters like this quarter that was a little bit high",Neutral
"So I still feel like that's going to be roughly about where it goes down, and then the cloud will continue to grow at that rate plus additional as more of the growth goes into the cloud",Neutral
"Sure, Vivek",Neutral
"I think in general, we see competition across almost every one of our platforms, whether it be in the data center or in the client business, and it's come from a variety of sources",Neutral
"And so you'll see a variety of SKUs progressing through 2018 as we ramp the 10-nanometer products, starting with the, I'll call it, more simpler SKUs at the beginning, going all the way through the high performance, high complexity SKUs towards the middle and back half of the year",Positive
"So I think, Stacy, first, we're quite proud of the growth rate we're seeing and especially the growth rates in the growth segments",Neutral
And so those two things counter those growth rates,Positive
"So we agree that over time, this will become a smaller and smaller impact to the growth rates",Positive
It weighs on our ability to get the growth rate higher,Positive
"Sure, John",Neutral
"What inning do you think you guys are in in that process, especially with AMD coming to market with new products? Is there still a mix, a potential story here, and what would drive that?",Neutral
I actually think there is,Neutral
"And so what I believe is that what the growth areas in the client space, gaming, virtual reality, thin and light, they're requiring performance and power",Positive
"And so those trends are going to continue, and that's why that's as we talked about, how do you feel about competition, where do you see competition playing",Neutral
"So, yes is the simple answer, Romit",Neutral
Remember this isn't necessarily us raising prices,Neutral
So the number of Core i7s,Neutral
Now they are targeting that more and more as well,Neutral
It's continuing to climb,Neutral
"And you said are we getting credit for this, so we don't think when you look overall this business, last year's performance with great growth in all of the segments",Positive
"You look at this year's performance so far in the first half and our projections now in the second half, we think that our ability to segment, to drive better operating margin, and to continue to drive performance into the PC and keep it more and more profitable while we invest and grow these other businesses, we think that there's an option around Intel that is quite good",Positive
"Yes, it's very little",Neutral
And so its impact into Q2 was minimal at best,Neutral
That was the highest number of pre-samples,Neutral
"And so I'd tell you when we talk about our growth and when we talk about our projections for the rest of this year and why we're investing in the future, that 64-tier NAND gives us the ability to be a better cost but the high performance end",Positive
"Thanks, Mark",Neutral
"Our data-centric businesses grew 15% year over year, reaching 45% of our revenue, proving that Intel is becoming a data-centric company",Positive
The fiscal discipline that Bob and I have talked about is delivering results even faster than we had forecasted while simultaneously allowing us to focus more on innovation in our key growth segments,Positive
revenue grew 2% or 6% after adjusting for the McAfee transaction,Positive
"Operating income grew 8% and earnings per share grew 26%, both reaching all-time records",Positive
Our data-centric businesses are the company's growth engine,Positive
"Individually, these businesses provide great value to our customers",Positive
"It's a source of great profit, cash flow, scale, and intellectual property",Positive
"We've made great progress in both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses over the last few months, and I'll share a few important milestones that illustrate that progress",Positive
"Moving on to our data-centric businesses, DCG [Data Center Group] revenue grew 7% in Q3 and remains on track for high single-digit growth for the year",Positive
"We saw strong cloud growth, outgrew the comm service provider end market and, while the enterprise decline moderated sequentially, we still see workloads moving to the cloud",Positive
roads,Neutral
Let's move on now to memory and FPGAs,Neutral
"Our memory business grew 37% over last year and operating margin improved significantly, as Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continued to beat both its ramp rate and yield goal",Positive
We shipped the industry's first 64-layer data center SSDs and have a strong Optane design win pipeline,Positive
"That leadership technology has also resulted in strong customer interest in long-term supply agreements, and we've already signed two such agreements",Positive
"And finally, in our FPGA business, revenue was up 10% over last year, with growth in the data center, embedded, and automotive segments, where we're ramping designs like the Level 3 autonomous 2018 Audi A8 and DENSO's stereo vision system",Positive
We had a quarter any CEO would be proud of,Neutral
"In other segments, we are the new competitor",Neutral
Our transformation is accelerating,Neutral
"And with that great news, I'd like to hand it over to Bob",Positive
"Hi, Ross",Neutral
So let's talk about this,Neutral
We can kind of break this down,Neutral
It will be handed out as test silicon,Neutral
It won't be a big impact,Neutral
So seeing it already and those newer products really think late 2018 and beyond before they really start to hit P&Ls,Neutral
"I'll start and Bob can jump in, Stacy",Neutral
You saw Google talk about it a couple weeks ago,Neutral
You saw Microsoft talk about it earlier this week,Neutral
Those ramps are just beginning,Neutral
This is going to take a year or more,Neutral
So I think it's early to make this judgment,Neutral
"The ramp is right within the range we predicted it to be from a ramp of that product The second part of your question, is 7% high single digits, I'll just make it simple and say look, if you look mathematically, I think it would meet a minima of high single digits, but it's certainly not necessarily where we're targeting to get to, but it's a high single digit number",Neutral
I'm not going to â€“ the math doesn't lie,Neutral
"Sure, we don't separate out inference",Neutral
And there's a variety of reasons for that,Neutral
"Part of it, it's sometimes hard",Neutral
So you've captured it quite well,Neutral
Let's just talk about this,Neutral
"So, that I think just talks about both the great execution in products and segmentation strategy and just the leadership that that team, at first with Navin Shenoy and now with Greg Bryant, have really delivered to the company",Positive
"So you talked about them, gaming, 2-in-1 devices, thin and light, the Ultrabook as we like to think about it from the old, those products are continuing to see growth actually, and they are pushing that record Core i5, Core i7. They're pushing the desire for Core i9, which is a new product we introduced",Neutral
We think to some level that trend will continue,Neutral
I'm excited about the modem business,Neutral
We believe we're there now,Neutral
Sure,Neutral
"I think in our statements and in the release, we showed you that we actually lowered CapEx by about $500 million for this year",Neutral
We've talked about CapEx and thinking about it as being in this range,Neutral
"Yes, think of it â€“ so first, absolutely you're right that we are going to move much more of our focus towards data center products coming first",Neutral
You've got to look at the design cycles,Neutral
"Sure, that's a great question",Neutral
I want a closed system,Neutral
I want to have much more control of the software,Neutral
But what we're able to do is bring our modems,Neutral
We can put Xeons in there,Neutral
This is not the only solution there is,Neutral
Amnon is out,Neutral
We're all talking about a complete package,Neutral
Our second fiscal quarter once again reflected strong momentum across the business,Positive
Each tax year is different,Neutral
This one's no exception,Neutral
"We're off to a strong start, and our important accountant relationships are helping to drive QuickBooks growth opportunities",Positive
"Shifting to Small Business, we continue to be pleased with the growth in our QuickBooks Online ecosystem",Positive
"Subscriber growth is accelerating, driven by product and platform innovation, improved product market fit outside of the United States, and a further expansion of our addressable market by targeting the self-employed segment",Positive
"Total QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49% in the quarter, up from 41% growth in the first quarter, and now shows more than 1.8 million subs",Positive
"Outside the United States, our subscriber base grew 61% year over year to approximately 370,000 paying subscribers, which is up from 50% growth in Q1. We saw a notable pickup in markets where our product market fit meets our test of readiness, including the UK, Australia, and Canada",Positive
"While it's early days for all of these innovations, the accelerating growth gives us confidence that our strategy is working",Positive
"In fact, online ecosystem revenue posted 30% growth in the quarter, up from 26% in Q1. To continue this momentum, we're investing, investing to improve the experience for customers and partners while getting the message out to more potential customers through events like QuickBooks Connect",Positive
"Thanks, Neil",Neutral
"We're continuing to gain momentum in our QuickBooks Online franchise as well, with strong growth in the U.S",Positive
"and select markets around the world, driving acceleration in subscriber growth and in online ecosystem revenue",Positive
"We're also expanding the category with QuickBooks Self-Employed and our new TurboTax Self-Employed offering connects our TurboTax and QuickBooks platforms, providing further runway for growth across our ecosystem",Positive
That's the halftime report,Neutral
Latif? Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"Keith, this is Brad",Neutral
I just want to add a couple of points for you,Neutral
"Right now in the United States, our QBO LTV to CAC is 5.5. If you add in desktop it's 6.9, and if you actually do a worldwide blended number, it's 4.5. So we feel good that we have a proxy and know that we're driving towards good profitable growth",Positive
"It may go up or down a point or two based upon choices we make, but that's a very good healthy margin for a business that's in good growth but also continuing to deliver the kind of rigor we want on the bottom line",Positive
"Thank you, Keith",Neutral
"But as you know, one of the things we try to do is translate our unit growth into e-files sent",Positive
And you know the noise here,Neutral
You followed the business for a lot of years,Neutral
"No, thanks for the question, Scott",Neutral
"Thanks for the question, Jesse",Neutral
What's really driving is the U.S,Neutral
"is up about 36%, outside the U.S",Neutral
So the product is really driving the acceleration of velocity and then we put topspin on it by putting more marketing into those markets because we feel good about the product market fit,Neutral
"So overall, it is accelerating velocity",Neutral
So it continues to get healthier,Neutral
We continue to see the cohorts of QBO or non-U.S,Neutral
QBO or Self-Employed continue to remain healthy,Neutral
"That's why we say this is more about staying focused on the ecosystem revenue growth, which went from 26% up to 30% and we think that's the best indicator of the long-term health of this business",Neutral
"Thank you, Jesse",Neutral
It comes down to who has the best end-to-end experience and product experience and we feel good about our position right now,Neutral
"And that's really what's driven the growth, not only in the U.S",Positive
but around the globe,Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
And the relationship has been in place in the U.S,Neutral
"Just to clarify also, a quick follow-up maybe on the SE number",Neutral
Take care,Neutral
"Sterling, it's across the board",Neutral
"If you go back and look over three decades, any time a lot of players either get more competitive, they're already in the game or new entrants come in, everyone leans into the advertising and marketing muscle and that gets more people to raise their head and say, hey, I'm paying hundreds of dollars to go to this service, why don't I try that instead? I think this is going to be net-net good for the category",Neutral
You've got new entrants coming in,Neutral
"I'm going to be guessing, Sterling",Neutral
"Okay, sorry about that",Neutral
It's a good number,Neutral
It's a healthy number,Neutral
"All right, thank you",Neutral
"Underneath that, we fight for share and then ultimately we try to get a good revenue per return",Positive
"As we were going into this year, we always say we like to see units grow faster than revenue and we like to see the category grow faster than the alternative method because that sets up a good lifeline for future monetization",Positive
"So we'll see what that does to return at the end of the year and ultimately what that does to revenue, but we're still striving to have healthy unit growth",Positive
"And in a good situation, we'd like to have units outpace revenue",Positive
"I'd say, Jim, it's early days this year",Neutral
"You're welcome, Jim",Neutral
"Hey, Michael",Neutral
I appreciate the questions as always,Neutral
We have 30 already in the market,Neutral
These are algorithms,Neutral
The second is on the website,Neutral
We don't tend to do it midseason,Neutral
"John, thank you for that question",Neutral
We're prepared for any of those scenarios,Neutral
"No, you're welcome, John",Neutral
I didn't mean to interrupt you,Neutral
Okay,Neutral
This is for Michael Millman,Neutral
"You had asked about RAs, the refund advances",Neutral
"Yeah, I'll be happy to do that",Neutral
"So thanks, everybody and have a good weekend",Neutral
All right,Neutral
"As you know, this is our largest quarter of the year and we successfully delivered strong financial results in a complicated tax season",Positive
We're also driving continued momentum in our Small Business franchise with QuickBooks Online subscriber growth accelerating to 59% and over 2.2 million subscribers which is above the upper end of the target we had established for the full fiscal year,Positive
The first driver is overall growth in the number of tax returns filed with the IRS,Positive
"The latest IRS data indicate that total returns are down slightly, below the 0% to 1% growth that we have forecasted",Positive
"If this trend plays out for the remainder of the tax filing year, it will be the slowest growth in total tax return since the year 2013. The second driver is the percentage of returns filed using do-it-yourself software",Positive
"With that said, DIY category growth once again outpaced the year-over-year decline in the assisted tax prep methods",Negative
"After strong share gains the past several years, our share with DIY e-file this season was flat",Positive
This performance is below the 1 point of share gain that we strive to achieve each year and we're already designing innovative ways to accelerate customer growth as we look ahead to next season,Positive
The fourth driver is revenue per return which has been stronger than our multiyear average of 1%,Positive
"And we introduced the Self-Employed bundle of QuickBooks and TurboTax, targeting the freelancer and gig economy, driving strong results which I'll discuss in greater detail in a minute",Positive
"Putting the bill around Consumer Tax, we're exiting this season with strong financial results, although generated in ways that were different than what we'd expected",Positive
This business delivered results that were better than our expectations with year-to-date revenue growth of 2%,Positive
"We've also seen early success in driving QBO subscribers through our tax sales efforts, fostering growth within the QBO franchise",Positive
"Subscriber growth continued to accelerate, driven by improvement across our platform that serves self-employed, small businesses and accountants",Positive
"As I mentioned earlier, total QBO subscribers grew 59% in the quarter, up from 49% growth in the second quarter",Positive
Our TurboTax Self-Employed offering contributed 11 points to the subscriber growth,Positive
We continue to drive strong growth in both our core U.S,Positive
business and international markets,Neutral
Outside the U.S,Neutral
"That's up from 61% growth in Q2. Within QuickBooks Online, the QuickBooks Self-Employed subscribers doubled to 360,000, up from 180,000 last quarter and 75,000 just one year ago",Positive
Our tax customer base is proving to be a great channel for reaching the self-employed and we know nearly 4 million TurboTax customers are self-employed tax filers,Positive
I'm also pleased to report that QuickBooks Self-Employed customers who come through the TurboTax channel have a higher product recommendation score as well,Positive
"Our momentum in QBO subscriber growth is driving top line revenue with online ecosystem revenue growing 30% again this quarter, at the high end of our 25% to 30% target range",Positive
"Thank you, Neil",Neutral
"Q3 was another strong quarter for Intuit with a hard-fought tax season that brought some bright spots as well as opportunities to improve, but ultimately delivered at the high end of our revenue guidance for the tax business",Positive
Small Business continued to gain momentum with accelerating QBO subscriber growth leading to an increase in our full year subscriber outlook and online ecosystem revenue topping the high end of our 25% to 30% target range for the second consecutive quarter,Positive
"Collectively, we're driving strong progress for the One Intuit Ecosystem strategy, creating greater value for our customers and building new sources of competitive advantage",Positive
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"Thank you, Kash",Neutral
So we haven't put in the outlook out there yet,Neutral
We'll talk more about fiscal year '18 in August,Neutral
"But like you, we see the real opportunity here and we think that this is just the early inning of what could be a long term growth driver for the company",Neutral
"Thanks for the question, Michael",Neutral
"This year, we did not do either of those",Neutral
We stepped back,Neutral
We laid out a game plan,Neutral
"And in 2014, we grew units 9%, 3x",Neutral
"Yes, Walter",Neutral
Let me break it down a little bit,Neutral
That takes me to the 20% tranche,Neutral
"Some of those may be prior year free customers, some of those could be existing pay customers that they see value bundles that they think were worthy of them actually paying and that's helped us increase our revenue",Neutral
We continue to get better at creating value that customers are willing to pay for and we're also seeing some early success at the higher end of our product line which we think bodes well for the future,Neutral
"Thank you, Jesse",Neutral
"First of all, I would say that we don't need to sell anything else to a self-employed customer for that to be a great business",Positive
"And as we look at that opportunity and even at our current price at roughly $10 a month to $120 a month with a low cost to acquire those customers, that is a very good and profitable business that could be substantial for the company",Positive
A great example is we added invoicing functionality into self-employed and that connects to payments,Positive
And we're still on the very early innings,Neutral
So we're proud of that momentum we're seeing,Neutral
"Brazil was on track, looking good",Neutral
It's a highly instrumented business,Neutral
"In terms of next year, I'll say this",Neutral
We don't take anything for granted,Neutral
So that's what we're looking forward to,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
That's up about 25% year-over-year,Neutral
"And so we basically done in 3 quarters what we did in 4 quarters last year, but that's not driving the bulk of this growth",Positive
"Yes, Kartik",Neutral
We have a 65 share,Neutral
"And I believe, this year, a combination of things",Neutral
So we'll have to sort through that,Neutral
And so we'll step back and take responsibility of what can we do to continue to accelerate that growth,Positive
What we do know is we've got secular tailwinds,Neutral
And the secular tailwinds are showing that DIY is still growing faster than the assisted methods and we just have to find ways to continue to accelerate that secular trend,Positive
And we will do that as we look to next year,Neutral
This is good news for the category,Neutral
"As you know, we've had lots of very good competition across many of our franchises over the years and every time a new competitor comes in, especially one that is well funded and they're aggressive in advertising and in pricing, that tends to accelerate the category growth because it gets more people and other masses to raise their head and get out of spreadsheets or come out of stores and say, wow, there might be a better way to do this",Neutral
"And if we didn't do what we know we have to do, have the best product and have the cleanest value prop, I think that's going to be good news for the category and good news for us",Neutral
So I anticipate a continuation of this year's ultra-aggressive competition and I think that's a good thing for consumers and I think it's a good thing for the category,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
"Thanks, Raimo",Neutral
We'll divide and conquer on this,Neutral
"In fact, in the U.S",Neutral
Let me hand it over to Neil to talk about 606.,Neutral
Okay,Neutral
"Thanks, Ross",Neutral
The answer to your first question is no,Neutral
"In terms of the noncore revenue, I think is the question, we have created value bundles and we marketed those this year, bundles that include, we call them, Flots and other kinds of bundles that have things like fraud, audit defense and the ability to make sure that if anything happened, we had the ability for you to go in and keep an eye on your credit card and your credit reports",Neutral
You said you had another question after that?,Neutral
"Thanks, Kirk",Neutral
"So you're referring to the 11 points of QuickBooks Online growth that we got from TurboTax Self-Employed, sending customers over",Positive
It is,Neutral
We have TurboTax in the U.S,Neutral
"Yes, Jim, I really wish I knew the explanation on the unit growth at the IRS level",Positive
"You know what, that math works for me",Neutral
"No, you actually got it",Neutral
We looked at -- we actually broke it down and looked at the revenue per return and it's roughly 7% as well,Negative
"Yes, Michael",Neutral
"So if you had to throw those 500,000 back into the mix which is why you heard Neil say that those don't show up in the IRS category growth numbers and they don't show up in our share counts because we always compare our stuff against the IRS",Positive
"But there's 500,000 that we did get paid for, so that shows up in our revenue, but it doesn't necessarily show up when the IRS prints its numbers and says, whoa, paper grew for the first time in a few years while it was because people processed with software and then had to mail it in because they didn't know their PIN",Positive
"I'm sorry, yes",Neutral
We're not tracking the same way,Neutral
"Go ahead, Neil",Neutral
"But our numbers are 2% unit growth, 9% year-to-date revenue growth and the average revenue per unit went up about 7% and that was the math that Jim was just asking about a few minutes ago as well",Positive
"Okay, Michael",Neutral
"On the free message, we still had that in digital",Neutral
And they all came out with TV ads,Neutral
"Yes, so Patrick, it's a combination of things",Neutral
com every year,Neutral
That is a huge funnel,Neutral
The last piece I would say is 2 parts,Neutral
One is new channels and one was TurboTax,Neutral
You add to that the opportunity to go with TurboTax as a channel and then open new geographies and we think self-employed has a lot of opportunity for growth as we look ahead,Neutral
I am so happy you asked that question,Neutral
I have been dying to share this data,Neutral
I had truly been waiting,Neutral
"Well, now with self-employed, it moved above 90%",Neutral
So this is expanding the category,Neutral
"Sure, thank you",Neutral
So it's the high end of that 25% to 30%,Neutral
"And as you can see, that is driving online ecosystem revenue growth, where we're at the high end of the range at 30% 2 quarters in a row",Positive
We'ren't worried about whether one is $10 a month or one is $24 a month because we focus on LTV to CAC to make sure we have the right discipline and cost to acquire and that's driving overall revenue growth and margin expansion,Positive
Yes,Neutral
"Sure, Brian, I'll keep it short",Neutral
"Obviously, we're feeling good with the quarter",Neutral
So looking forward to catching up with you soon,Neutral
"And with that, thanks for the time this afternoon",Neutral
"Thank you, Valentin",Neutral
"And good morning, everyone",Neutral
I would also like to thank Sharon Merrill Associates for 10 great years of IR advisory service to IPG,Positive
"Turning to the results, first quarter revenue grew 38% to a record $286 million",Positive
"Year-over-year growth rates accelerated in applications for cutting and welding, our two largest end markets, while marking and engraving grew by a single-digit percentage, year-over-year",Positive
"China, our largest geographic region from a revenue standpoint, was also among our fastest growth areas, up 89% year-over-year",Positive
"We believe this is being driven by secular growth across several different industries, multiple applications, and a healthy consumer electronics investment cycle",Positive
", welding sales were particularly strong this quarter, the result of considerable work done by our application engineers to demonstrate the power performance and flexibility of our solutions within advanced automotive welding applications",Positive
"In Europe, despite a subdued auto market, we saw strong growth driven by high power laser sales into cutting applications",Positive
sales in Japan were down double digits due to seasonal softness and expected lower volume at one of our largest cutting OEMs due to the timing of orders,Negative
"We are encouraged by the rapid growth of QCW in the quarter and expect another strong quarter in Q2. However, a moderation in the consumer electronics cycle with the completion of key capacity additions later this year, for example, would cause our rate of growth in QCW to slow",Positive
Medium power laser sales declined 13% due to decreased demand for fine-cutting applications and the transition to higher power lasers at one kilowatt and above,Negative
"Working our way down the income statement, gross margin of 55% was down 20 basis points from Q1 2016 and at the top of our guidance range of 50% to 55%",Negative
"We were able to largely offset declines in average selling prices with, one, improved manufacturing efficiency; two, component and material cost reductions; and three, a larger proportion of our sales coming from high power CW, high power pulsed and QCW lasers which carry a higher gross margin",Negative
"We were able to achieve leverage in all three areas, despite higher spending related to product development, new applications and manufacturing processes, as well as the expansion of our sales force",Positive
Our tax rate in the first quarter was 26%,Neutral
"If exchange rates, relative to the U.S",Neutral
"We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $863 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and $40 million of debt",Positive
Moving on to guidance,Neutral
We anticipate Q2 earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.50 to $1.70. The midpoint of this guidance represents quarterly revenue and EPS growth of approximately 31% and 28% respectively year-over-year,Positive
"The magnitude of our Q1 outperformance and current Q2 revenue guidance has exceeded our expectations when compared to those assumed in our annual guidance of 10% to 14% revenue growth in 2017. As such, we believe the stronger than expected performance and guidance for the first half of the year should be treated as additive to our full year revenue growth outlook",Positive
"While order flow remains strong, our visibility into the back half of the year particularly Q4 remains somewhat limited",Positive
"With that, Valentin and I will be happy to take your questions",Positive
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
We get to a slightly lower number than that,Neutral
I think one of the challenges as well is you had an exceptionally strong Q4 a year ago when the momentum that we're seeing now really started to pick-up,Positive
"That started in Q3, accelerated into Q4. So we're bearing in mind that we actually have a pretty difficult comparison in Q4. Nonetheless, the thing that we do want to call out is that order flow right now remains very strong through April and that's reflected in the Q2 guidance and the strength of order flow through Q1 is reflected in that as well",Positive
So I'm not going to get drawn on the 25%,Neutral
"So first of all, I think the kilowatts of units sold was up by about â€“ kilowatts of power sold was up by 60% and then valves in reference unit sales up by approximately 70%",Neutral
30% is the number,Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
So the color we've given around this is that order flow remains very strong,Positive
"If order flow remains where it is, we're going to have â€“ just talking about this in a qualitative manner, a good strong Q3 performance as well",Positive
"And, so the overall trends behind the business are very strong",Positive
"It's been an extraordinary period for us and I think that just is a testament to the execution, the quality of the product, as we've mentioned, and the acceleration of the adoption of fiber as compared to other technologies",Neutral
"So there's still â€“ you know the great thing is, there's still not much contribution from those",Positive
And when they start to come to bear on revenue it should be a good backup that we have,Positive
"I think competition is finding it extremely difficult to compete across the leading edge of the technology of the product, which drives the different performance parameters in terms of electrical efficiency being one, beam quality, the tremendous scale that we have on manufacturing, the service and support we have around the world, the application laboratories that support that service and sales, the investment that's gone into that",Neutral
"On the cutting side, I think this is a difficult thing to state without â€“ there's very little data behind it, but one of the things we've said is that you shouldn't just focus on the annual sales of high-powered lasers for cutting applications",Neutral
"Now we're being not as aggressive maybe, only 25%",Neutral
So the QCW wasn't just welding,Neutral
"And these are all area that we're looking for growth, so it's across a variety of different things that we're succeeding at",Positive
So the great thing is that it's across a variety of applications and a lot of those applications are generally sort of organic with what we think are sustainable trends in the market,Positive
"So it's difficult to call it out for next year yet, but we think we're in an exceptionally strong position relative to the other technologies and even non-laser technologies at this point in time",Positive
We've mentioned that you're always trying to balance the declines in ASPs across different product lines with new product introductions and getting a benefit from the higher power lasers in different product categories that we get to,Negative
We also are adding manufacturing capacity,Neutral
I think Valentin would probably second that,Neutral
"On the cost side, I think one of the interesting things here is that we think the market price of diodes is still around $10 per watt",Neutral
We didn't disclose any backlog information,Neutral
It's pretty similar to what we're seeing in Q1. We'll get another good quarter out of China showing strong year-over-year growth,Positive
The momentum in Europe continues to be good,Neutral
as well has a good opening backlog,Neutral
Nothing in particular,Neutral
"You can see â€“ in about 50% of the time you see Q4 being lower than Q3. And that's generally driven by in those years where you have a strong consumer electronics cycle you can see China revenue a bit lower in Q4, so we'll watch that",Positive
"So automotive, I think, is strong, and it's certainly strong and weaker, stronger in some areas and weaker in others",Positive
"Europe's okay, not showing tremendous growth year-over-year on the automotive applications",Positive
"And Japan might be an area, where we're starting to get some indications from some of the major customers there that maybe in the second half of the year, the automotive investment cycle may start to improve there where it's been â€“ I'd call Japan as well sluggish like Europe over the last year or so",Neutral
Sorry,Neutral
"I think we've disclosed in the K, and this is very approximate number because I could caution you again, the application date that we get sometimes is not the most accurate, but in all cutting applications both high-power and mid-power and even some of the QCW is about 50% of total revenue",Neutral
Trends on cutting continue to be very strongly,Neutral
"We continue to see the displacement of the installed base of lasers and then move towards higher power, both with fine metal and that should continue to provide some sustained growth for the company",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
It definitely has continued through April,Neutral
"And that order flow is very strong, and then it carried on through February and March",Positive
"For example, the move towards higher power levels",Neutral
No,Neutral
"Fundamentally, I think that this is pleasing",Neutral
"Actually, you'll see our former largest customer will report some stronger sales this year",Positive
"It's only thing, that's having a benefit",Neutral
And there's a bit more momentum there,Neutral
The U.S,Neutral
economy clearly at the moment is pretty strong,Neutral
China credit remains available,Neutral
"So yeah, I think the global economies is as strong as it has been for a while, and that helps with the industrial investment cycle",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
We're not big on telecom in China at the moment,Neutral
It's a very small part of our business,Neutral
Most of our telecom is outside of China,Neutral
"Thank you, Kathleen",Neutral
"Good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
We were off to a positive start in 2017 and delivered strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the March quarter,Positive
Total revenue was $1.221 billion at the high end of our guidance range and we saw year-over-year growth across all customer verticals,Positive
"We delivered strong profitability metrics with year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share",Positive
I'm pleased with our year-over-year revenue growth of 25% in the Cloud vertical and would point out that our cloud solutions are addressing the cloud transformation across all of our key verticals,Positive
"In switching, we saw continued data center strength with our QFX products family, which once again grew over 50% year-over-year and continues to increase as a percentage of our overall switching portfolio mix",Positive
"Our routing business grew year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of PTX revenue growth as well as modest growth in MX",Positive
We believe we are making good progress as evidenced by new logo wins with our newest security products,Positive
"We saw year-over-year growth in Contrail, and added several new customers in Q1, including a tier 1 operator in Europe",Positive
"We saw continued strength in our overall services business, which grew 14% year-over-year",Positive
"I am particularly pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our professional services business, where we had a strategic win at a tier 1 service provider in EMEA",Positive
"Looking at the remainder of 2017, we expect overall demand to be seasonal and believe our customer diversification is positioning us for growth as we navigate through volatile markets",Positive
"Hi, Jess, it's Rami",Neutral
"Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken",Neutral
The heart of that is the data center,Neutral
We've always been in this space,Neutral
"We've always had a solution, but I would say that we've never had a solution that is this strong and that has the breadth of capabilities, both from a software standpoint, but also from an entire portfolio standpoint, the spine switches with the QFX10000 as well as the top-of-racks with the 5100, 5200s, et cetera",Positive
"Do I believe that there will be continued momentum? Yes, we have, in our long-term model for this company's growth, been counting on and have provided you with color on where we see our switching business to come in",Positive
And that is going to continue to be a big growth driver for the company in the year and longer term,Positive
"Hi, Simona",Neutral
And then I'll pass it over to Ken,Neutral
We think that we can compete in that environment by taking some modest market share with really competitive products,Neutral
"That's what's happening really in the cloud space as well, where a lot of the growth is coming in from in the cloud providers, is in switching today",Positive
One is really targeted for the edge,Neutral
One is for wide area,Neutral
One is more for the data center,Neutral
"And the things that gives me the confidence in our ability to stabilize and then recover and then grow this part of our business is the fact that when I look at key metrics, like the performance of new products with the newer capabilities that we have introduced into the market over the last, let's say, six to nine months, there's growth there",Positive
There is in fact momentum,Neutral
And there is in fact sales achievement and revenue growth that we are seeing in that part of the business,Positive
It's just not fast enough to offset the decline in some of the older products,Negative
We need a little bit of patience and a lot more of the very hard work that I know that is going across the entire company right now to get this back to stability and then to growth,Positive
And I expect in the second half of the year that we can get to growth,Positive
I think we can get this back on track,Neutral
"Hi, Kulbinder, it's Rami",Neutral
So let me start,Neutral
Any one of these verticals is going to be lumpy,Neutral
"Anything you want to add, Ken, to that? Okay",Neutral
"Telco and routing remains a challenging market, and we think that it will be relatively flattish for us and maybe some modest growth in that sector and those technologies",Negative
I want to just add to that,Neutral
I completely agree with everything Ken just said,Neutral
"Will there be consistent, sequential growth throughout the year in any vertical? Honestly, it's very difficult to predict that because all of our verticals, Cloud included, is going to be lumpy",Positive
"Sure, Jim",Neutral
That's where the effort is,Neutral
The only additional thing I will say is that there are really strong synergies between Security and the rest of our portfolio,Positive
Yeah,Neutral
The math is not working for overall growth,Positive
This year I think is going to be a critical year for us as we get back to stability and growth probably in the latter half of the year,Neutral
You're welcome,Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
"Hi, Vijay",Neutral
We have competitors that are larger,Neutral
We have competitors that are smaller than us,Neutral
"The key to our success is to focus, and if you look at what we have done over the last couple of years, there has been an incredible amount of effort put into streamlining our business, pruning our product portfolio to areas where we know that we can invest to compete effectively, and I think we're demonstrating our ability to do just that",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
I appreciate that question,Neutral
"The cost synergies and our ability to leverage technology actually enabled us to achieve: A, differentiation; and very solid efficiency in how we develop the technology that's underlying Security",Positive
So that's how I'm thinking about it right now,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
Thanks for the question,Neutral
It's a very healthy business for us,Neutral
"On the revenue side, the key is what you mentioned, the attach rates, the renewal rates, and the focus there over the past several quarters is really starting to pay off as we're seeing the revenue growth consistently do well",Positive
It will eventually start to normalize closer together on the growth rate perspective,Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"Thanks for the question, Jayson",Neutral
And then there is what we expect in the future,Neutral
A lot of the growth in the Q1 timeframe for example in the cloud vertical came in Switching,Positive
You're welcome,Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
"Yeah, thanks for the question, Mitch",Neutral
"And for that reason, if you look at our Switching growth, especially as it pertains to the data center over the last few years, it has been quite good",Positive
"Yeah, sure",Neutral
Let me start on the organizational piece,Neutral
Thanks James,Neutral
You can tell me if I didn't,Neutral
They're going to be at the edge of the network,Neutral
"It's typically going to be for more scale out type of applications, think of the CPE space where the physical CPE business has generally been a small revenue generator for Juniper",Neutral
"Now as the industry transitions to a virtual equivalent model to the CPE space, we view this in fact as a great opportunity for us to go and to participate in",Positive
Thank you,Neutral
"Thank you, Kathleen",Neutral
"Good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
We delivered good year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the June quarter,Positive
"Total revenue was $1.309 billion at the high end of our guidance range, with growth driven by record revenue in Switching and continued strength in the Cloud vertical",Positive
"We delivered strong profitability metrics, with year-over-year growth in operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share",Positive
"We're executing on our strategy to lead the transformation to the cloud, and I'm happy with the continued strength in our cloud-oriented solution across our key focus verticals",Positive
"Telcos are going through a significant transformation as trends such as SD-WAN, 5G, IoT, and overall broadband growth are driving the need to evaluate Cloud-grade architectural shift in order to increase automation, reduce costs and enable greater service speed and agility",Positive
"In Switching, we saw continued momentum with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth across all verticals",Positive
"Two effects continued to see strong year-over-year growth in cloud data center, driven by the industry's migration towards 100-gigabit infrastructure and as our customers adopt end-to-end solutions with Juniper's ToR and spine portfolio",Positive
We also saw year-over-year and sequential growth in our EX products,Positive
"In Routing, the MX had good year-over-year and sequential growth",Positive
"We had another strong quarter in our services business, where we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services",Positive
"We saw good momentum in the first half of the year, and we anticipate delivering revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth for the full year",Positive
"Actually, Rod, let me start",Neutral
"And then Ken, why don't you weigh in? So on the first question around growth, goes without saying we're pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year",Positive
We're off to a strong start for 2017. It certainly gives us confidence that we can meet our objective of achieving revenue growth and earnings growth in 2017 all up,Positive
"Telco, it's going to be more of the same",Neutral
"So all up, we remain optimistic about the year, and we're off to a solid start in achieving both revenue and margin growth for the full year",Positive
"Sure, Simon",Neutral
I'll start with the question about Routing,Neutral
"So yes, traffic is growing",Neutral
"Having said that, I think that there are some things that are going to be happening at some point in the future around metro buildouts, around new modes of delivering services to enterprises that leverage things like new Cloud-managed solutions to connectivity and security that we are very much engaging with our customers on today, difficult to tell exactly when that will result in actual revenue growth for us",Neutral
They're driving a lot of the world's sort of wide area traffic growth,Positive
"So, Tal, I appreciate the question",Neutral
We're just off to a really solid start this year,Neutral
"I think, as you saw in the Q2 timeframe, we sort of hit the high end of our revenue range",Neutral
And I think you also mentioned Switching,Neutral
Obviously very happy with the Switching performance that we have demonstrated well ahead of our long-term model,Positive
Our customer adoption is excellent,Neutral
"Sure, Jeff",Neutral
Let me start,Neutral
"On the question around Switching, we have expected and we have seen that Switching is in fact the main growth driver for the business",Positive
"But that said, that's not a comment at all that I think you should take that would demonstrate a lack of confidence in the product, the technology and the market focus",Neutral
And that's exactly what they're doing,Neutral
And I think it will continue in terms of being a growth driver for us for the rest of the year and for the foreseeable future,Neutral
Let me address that,Neutral
"And while it's still early, typically these things take a couple of quarters, maybe nine months to get to revenue, I do expect revenue for this first iteration of Universal Chassis in the second half of this year",Neutral
"Thanks, James, both good questions",Neutral
"First on the appointment of Bikash Koley as CTO, very, very happy with this hire",Positive
And that is the Cloud,Neutral
"And all of our customers in these verticals, whether they be Telco, Cable, Enterprises, government and of course the hyperscalers are looking for real leadership from a product direction, from a services direction that helps them to make this transition to a cloud architecture that helps them become far more agile and to save money, just as the hyperscale providers have demonstrated can be possible",Neutral
And Bikash has that as well,Neutral
"But quite frankly, the focus right now on Security has been on achieving stability and returning to growth",Positive
"Once we get the stability, I think, yeah, there is certainly a possibility for us to start to look at inorganic approaches to accelerate the momentum in our business",Neutral
We believe there is an architectural inflection point where customers can achieve vast levels of cost efficiency by managing and operating their networks across packet and optical,Positive
I just mentioned Security,Neutral
"Even in the domain of Security, I think any sort of inorganic activity that we would contemplate or explore would be more around the new modes of security, not so much of around sort of the physical perimeter firewall which is current mode",Neutral
"On Security, and I think, the question was around whether we're driving Security products in the Cloud vertical",Neutral
"Maybe, Kulbinder, it's worthwhile just summarizing the areas of focus that we currently have with respect to gross margins",Neutral
And there is a concerted effort right now in the company to optimize our products for cost of goods sold in a way that will help gross margins,Positive
"Third, there's innovation",Neutral
The primary reason is because we believe that there is an opportunity there through innovation to achieve better cost of goods sold from an optical standpoint,Positive
"All of these emerging opportunities I think have the ability to not just help top line, but to also help gross margins",Neutral
"So, I outlined the main areas of focus",Neutral
I believe the second half and in particular Q4 would be sort of a quarter that I would expect to start seeing some year-over-year growth in the security market,Positive
Okay,Neutral
"We certainly have a strong Tier 1 presence in Switching, but we have less market share and penetration than we do in Routing",Positive
"And, therefore, that's certainly a potential growth area for us",Positive
And I think that's a very healthy thing,Neutral
We can certainly do something like that maybe at our next Analyst Day,Neutral
"Every time a new port speed is introduced into the market, as it achieves mass adoption, you will expect, as we would do, that pricing will start to go down and it offsets the benefit that you would get from the traffic growth alone in the market",Positive
"So all up, the Routing space is roughly a sort of a flattish type of total addressable market from a growth standpoint, but traffic is growing at 40% plus year-over-year",Positive
"Thank you, Steve",Neutral
There's a very important reason for that,Neutral
"If you think about what our customers across every vertical want more than anything else, it is the ability to move fast, to innovate quickly and to do so with a certain level of cost efficiency",Neutral
"You achieve that by first, providing them with innovative Routing, Switching, and Security products that outpace Moore's Law from an economics of traffic movement standpoint",Positive
"Yeah, thanks",Neutral
I appreciate the question,Neutral
"And we didn't do that for QFX in Q2. However, I think it's safe to say that we would not be able to post this type of overall Switching momentum without strong QFX performance",Positive
So we're very happy with the performance of our QFX product line in the Q2 timeframe,Positive
"And for that, you need a high degree of performance, operational simplicity and automation and I think the EX from all three of those dimensions is an extremely competitive product",Neutral
"Thank you, Martin",Neutral
We ended the calendar year was strong performance for the December quarter exceeding the midpoint of our guidance and all financial metrics,Positive
"As we share during our Analyst Day in November, this is an exciting time for the segment to the market, with 3D NAND possibly the largest growth driver in the industry",Positive
"Weâ€™re pleased with our leadership in 3D NAND, in particular with our strong position in the most critical applications like the channel whole edge, the mold stack and the word line fill",Positive
"Content growth in areas such as servers and smartphones, have contributed to a burn down of inventory and corresponding upward movement in DRAM prices",Positive
"The foundry segment remained strong at 31% of system shipments in the December quarter, which was down slightly in absolute dollars from the record level we saw in the September quarter",Positive
"As Martin mentioned, weâ€™ve made some significant market share gains in the foundry and logic space as our customers are migrating to smaller geometries and implementing more challenging architectures",Negative
"Operating profitability was very strong in the quarter; we generated operating income of $490 million, which was an increase of 34% compared to the $366 million that we generated in September quarter",Positive
Let me now take you through the balance sheet,Neutral
"We exited the December quarter with a deferred revenue balance of $673 million, down a little bit from $704 million in the September quarter",Negative
This number is up from $65 million last quarter,Neutral
Gross margin is down somewhat from the previous quarter due to business mix,Negative
"Looking ahead, we remain committed to our objective of creating value for shareholders and to successfully executing on the growth opportunities ahead of us",Positive
That concludes my prepared remarks,Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"Thanks, Tim",Neutral
", but Iâ€™ll remind you, the way to think about it is when youâ€™ve got an accelerating shipment profile like weâ€™ve had you always get revenue lags as it just takes time to get things into the fab and they accepted",Neutral
"What happens when shipments level off or if they in one quarter might go down a little bit, then revenue will catch up",Negative
For calendar 2017.,Neutral
"Thanks, Stephen",Neutral
"Farhan, you heard Martin described kind of more first half weighted overall both WFE and shipments, and also describe NAND is maybe more first half weighted than the other stuff, so thatâ€™s a data point for you",Neutral
"When we look at March as well as June, everything is pretty strong",Positive
There you go,Neutral
"You got a follow-up, Farhan?",Neutral
But it was roughly in line,Neutral
"And you got it right, itâ€™s very cash generative, very profitable business, very broad-based in terms of the number of engagements and number of customers",Positive
"And generally speaking that chart that Tim Archer showed you at the Analyst Day, weâ€™re very much on track to deliver that, that growth that we had targeted and are targeting",Positive
"Thanks, Harlan",Neutral
"Thanks, Chris",Neutral
"I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s necessarily more profitable year on year, Patrick",Positive
Itâ€™s always been quite profitable,Positive
"Itâ€™s a great business, right? All the investment occurs in new equipment",Positive
It gets leveraged in installed base,Neutral
Itâ€™s just - itâ€™s a very profitable part of the business,Positive
But on a year-on-year basis I donâ€™t think itâ€™s really more profitable necessarily,Positive
"Thanks, Patrick",Neutral
Thanks Martin,Neutral
Shipments for the quarter were strong at $2.413 billion which was up 25% sequentially and again above the midpoint of the guided range,Positive
"Memory shipments were very strong in the quarter, as customers continued their investments in three 3D NAND capacity",Positive
NAND demand continues to be strong driven by growth in enterprise and client SSDs as well as mobile device density increases,Positive
We're seeing an uptick in DRAM spending in line with improving demand in content growth from areas such as smartphones and servers,Positive
And I just like to remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing profitability performance,Neutral
Operating expenses in the quarter grew as we knew they would to $414 million,Positive
Now let me return to the balance sheet,Neutral
And I'll just do the math for you,Neutral
Our business has never been stronger financially and we're continuing to execute extremely well,Positive
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"The only thing Iâ€™d like to point out Stephen is obviously, you know what memory revenue is likely to be this year, it's super strong, right",Positive
And so youâ€™ve always have to think about affordability and clearly the levels that are going on today are affordable given how strong revenue and memory is,Positive
"Yeah, I mean we're - Tim, as you know we guide one quarter at time, weâ€™ll give you a little bit of color which is what Martin did, when he said a little more balanced than the 55/45 and there's also reason I gave you the deferred revenue number, so you can think about how that likely transpires through the year",Neutral
"Yeah, youâ€™re reading too much into Krish",Neutral
C,Neutral
J,Neutral
", the guidance I gave you as you think to margin percentages, even though weâ€™re maybe not exactly on the financial model, we provided to you the margin percentages in the financial model are still good guideposts if you will in terms of how to model our business",Neutral
"Iâ€™ll give you a comment, Toshiya",Neutral
"Will be very small, Joe",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
There is leverage in the model,Neutral
"Thank you, Warren, and good morning everybody",Neutral
So welcome to the place,Neutral
Our business continues to perform well,Neutral
We're very pleased to have delivered a strong result for the year driven by solid execution of our strategy,Positive
"For the quarter, our net revenue growth was 10%, EPS growth 7% or 31% EPS when you normalize for taxes",Positive
"And what those numbers mean for the full year of 2016 is we saw net revenue growth of 13% and EPS growth of 11%, or 19% when normalized for taxes",Positive
Post-election optimism remains relatively high,Neutral
The UK appears to be stable,Neutral
"We're seeing continued growth in travel to the country as a result of the weaker pound, and it's going to take a few years obviously to work through the specifics of how Brexit is implemented",Positive
"Given the heavy reliance on cash in that economy, this is expected to soften consumer spending in the short term, but could well fuel economic growth and modernize the payment system in the long term",Positive
We're seeing double digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets,Positive
"We've been working with the UK competition regulator to secure approval of the transaction, and we're really pleased as they have accepted in principle our proposed solution to address their one concern regarding the LINK ATM scheme",Positive
"Overall, 2016 was a year that had its economic and regulatory challenges, but I think we've navigated those successfully while putting significant points on the board as a result of our investments in digital, in safety and security, in data analytics, loyalty and processing",Neutral
"This last quarter, we continued our momentum in the US, pleased to have renewed a number of deals including SunTrust Bank for their credit, debit and commercial business, which, by the way, includes Labs as a service to help drive their innovation agenda, as well as the First National Bank of Omaha, one of the largest private banks in the US, for their credit and commercial portfolios",Positive
So let me move on to digital,Neutral
"We're pleased to have achieved our stated goal of enabling 80 million accounts by the end of 2016. The services have been rolled out globally with several banks, including Bank of America, Capital One, Citi, Nordea, and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia",Positive
"This quarter, we're building on that momentum",Neutral
So let me move on to Mastercard Send,Neutral
"So building on that theme of AI, we've also launched Decision Intelligence, one of our safety and security products which uses machine learning to score transactions based on an individualized risk profile in order to reduce false declines, while at the same time mitigating potential fraud",Negative
"And remember, our focus on services is in delivering capabilities that connect right back to our core business, providing great value and competitive differentiation to our clients while giving us an incremental revenue stream",Positive
"So with assets like these, we not only deliver great insight, we're actually building even stronger relationships with our merchant partners as well",Positive
"Yes, I absolutely am",Neutral
"So, there's a lot of opportunity there, first; second, there's the whole commercial space that's got a great deal of opportunity that we've been assiduously building on; third, we've got our services revenue; and fourth, we've actually beginning to participate in the direct to bank account payments once the VocaLink acquisition is complete",Positive
"So, to me, we're building the right portfolio to take on the opportunities that this secular growth represents over the next decade, not just one or two years",Positive
"Who allowed you to ask that question, Tien-Tsin?",Neutral
It's nice to hear from you,Neutral
"So, I think that it's early days to talk in great depth about what all could happen, but I'll tell you my views that are on the positive side of this, and then you can see, obviously, through the news that there are people who are concerned as well about the negative side of it",Positive
"I think that's pretty clear, and he is definitely committed to helping make it easier for businesses to open, operate and run profitably in the system",Neutral
They'll end up winning on some and losing on some,Neutral
I just don't know which ones will go where,Neutral
"I do know that in an environment which talks about regulation being something you need to watch carefully so that you enact the right kind of regulation, but you don't stifle innovation and growth, that could lead to definitely a constructive view",Positive
That's kind of where I'm coming from,Neutral
"So, I think that's important",Neutral
I'm talking corporate taxes right now,Neutral
"If it comes down to anything below that, you should expect us as a company to benefit from it directly to the bottom line",Negative
There's rumors that it will go to 20% or 25%,Neutral
We do have a lot overseas,Neutral
We do have stuff in Asia,Neutral
They want to grow the economy,Neutral
"Don't ask questions again, man",Neutral
That's a good thing,Neutral
That includes fees,Neutral
2018 is when it starts hitting the road,Neutral
They've just about closed,Neutral
"We're in the marketplace, looking at what anything happens in the market on either pricing, in which case we may have some opportunity, or on volume growth and share growth, which we continue to pursue and we're continuing to win some deals in Europe",Positive
"So, it's kind of early days",Neutral
We're in the game,Neutral
They've all got different growth rates and trajectories,Positive
"And I believe we have cutting-edge products that are differentiated and are capable of helping institutions across the world plug in and help them manage potential fraud while work on declines, and so help them really maximize their P&L in attractive ways when they're looking for revenue",Negative
"So, I continue to believe those two will be very attractive growth areas over the next five to ten years",Positive
The loyalty business is actually very interesting,Neutral
We're actually getting some nice wins in that space and we continue to believe that the loyalty and rewards space will be a good growth area and a good sticky area with our customers,Positive
"So, do I see this as being a relatively attractive growth area, a faster percentage of growth than our core business? Probably, because it's off a smaller base as well",Positive
This is a live area,Neutral
"The fact is that even at 8% or 10%, core payment transaction growth of 8% or 10% is attractive",Positive
Europe had a number of them,Neutral
Mexico has them,Neutral
Canada had them,Neutral
Australia has them,Neutral
India has launched RuPay and UID,Neutral
They play different roles,Neutral
"So, there's a whole range of these",Neutral
"What we've been trying to do is to go back into marketplaces that we believe that the existence of these schemes is, one, either creating an imbalance in the market or holding back growth, and attempt to either work with the government or the banks to find ways to either partner with those schemes or find ways to change the laws around those schemes so that you can have a more open marketplace, which should benefit merchants and should benefit banks and should benefit consumers",Neutral
"The one you're specifically getting at is more like the Russian model, where there is a domestic payment scheme generated and created, and we have helped them put their technology together and connect with them and provide services that are value added from safety, security, cross-border approvals, transaction management to information and data, which are provided by our better capable systems than they have of their own",Neutral
"Having said that, we have had a relationship with Alipay and Alibaba for the last couple of years on helping them think through how to use our technology to figure out different aspects of their own service, including the detection of fraud products on their website",Neutral
Some of that relationship has worked well,Neutral
"So, I've had the same view of PayPal",Neutral
I have the same view of Alipay,Neutral
We've come at it differently,Neutral
We'll win some deals; we'll lose some deals,Neutral
But I kind of believe there's enough secular growth opportunity in this space for a lot of us to flourish,Positive
Sure,Neutral
The ATMs had to be redesigned,Neutral
Their hoppers had to be redone,Neutral
"So, that's what caused some of the dislocation",Neutral
"Now, 1.4 million merchant terminals",Neutral
"Second, there's a great deal of partnership with merchant organizations on the ground",Positive
We are actively rolling them out,Neutral
That's Europeans traveling within Europe,Neutral
That's basically what's going on,Neutral
Europeans are staying closer to home,Neutral
The UK is interesting,Neutral
Inbound into the UK is up substantially,Neutral
Outbound from the UK is negative,Neutral
"Not just down, negative, substantially",Neutral
"So, it's kind of a mixed bag across the range",Neutral
I'll leave you with a couple of closing thoughts,Neutral
We had a strong year in 2016. Our financial performance was driven by the growth for our core business and our ability to continue to differentiate ourselves with services,Positive
That led to significant business wins this year,Neutral
"As I just said in some of the Q&A, the secular growth opportunity in our business remains very strong",Positive
India is just a great recent example of this,Positive
We will continue to invest for that future,Neutral
"Good morning, everybody",Neutral
You can see that in our strong second quarter financial and operational performance,Positive
We're really pleased,Neutral
"We're delivering net revenue growth of 14% and if you exclude a special item related to a legal provision that we took last year in the same quarter, EPS growth is 16%, both of these numbers on a currency-neutral basis",Positive
"economy just continues its steady growth trajectory; low unemployment, low inflation, healthy consumer confidence, and if you look at our SpendingPulse data, retail sales ex auto were up 3.6%, that's kind of similar to last quarter",Positive
"Now in the UK, interestingly, despite ongoing concerns around Brexit, SpendingPulse showed solid overall retail sales growth of 5% in the quarter and that's partly driven by higher consumer spending due to rising inflation, the lower pound basically",Positive
"In Asia, we continue to see strong economic growth in India and several of the ASEAN countries",Positive
"Economic growth in Mexico has been solid, driven by consumer spending",Positive
"With this backdrop, we're kind of pleased with the growth we're seeing across our business",Positive
We're seeing double digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets,Positive
"We have Mastercard Send and now, Fast ACH rails",Neutral
"Now in the safety and security space, we recently announced our agreement to acquire Brighterion, whose artificial intelligence based technology enables more accurate decision-making and fraud scoring at the time of the transaction, obviously to mitigate risk and also reduce false declines",Negative
Bank to Mastercard,Neutral
Still with U.S,Neutral
"Bank, that's our partner in this co-brand",Neutral
We also renewed Saturn (8:20) there in the U.S,Neutral
Building on the agreement we announced in the U.S,Neutral
"And just for an example, in Europe, we have multiple co-brands with them, including a prepaid program in Italy, commercial debit in the UK and, by the way, they've also been a licensed issuer in the region since 2011. Now talking about Europe, we continue to drive strong performance and win new deals there",Positive
I'm going to give you a couple of examples,Neutral
"So, finally, we're continuing to see growth in our commercial business, and is driven by a combination of innovation and some new deals",Positive
The idea clearly is to capture new payment flows,Neutral
", which is powered by Masterpass",Neutral
We've also added U.S,Neutral
Bank and SunTrust in the U.S,Neutral
We've also added Davivienda in Columbia,Neutral
That's the progress we are making,Neutral
"This quarter, we're really pleased to have added Ann Taylor, LOFT, Hulu, Air Canada, costco Canada",Positive
That's one way to have built it,Neutral
ACH has been a country-by-country business,Neutral
That's the first point,Neutral
That's broadly what we're trying to do,Neutral
There were a series of these that went in,Neutral
I will tell you this,Neutral
"They wanted to create fresh momentum and fresh competition in the market, both for us and against what we do, and I think that's fine",Neutral
That's a competitive marketplace,Neutral
"Sanjay, not yet directly",Neutral
"But, we are winning deals along the way",Neutral
"Either the yields of that market, which tend to be lower than global yields, will begin to come up a little bit, maybe, maybe not; we'll see",Neutral
One of those two will fall into place,Neutral
"But, it's early days",Neutral
it's really a B2B2C solution,Neutral
I'm fine with that,Neutral
That to me is our model,Neutral
That's not what I'm trying to do,Neutral
The standards topic is a really interesting one,Neutral
"To me, if you're going to make progress in expanding acceptance and QR code is a little bit of our expanding acceptance into markets where infrastructure and the cost of having terminals as well as the running costs of managing those terminals, are challenging",Negative
I'm glad you called them prepared remarks,Neutral
But I will note that for my future,Neutral
"So, Kroger",Neutral
And Martina will be able to help you with that,Neutral
"First of all, you're correct",Neutral
But there are others we didn't win,Neutral
That's the principle behind those deals,Neutral
It's the same for winning more credit share with issuers and for looking at them as part of participating in their growth,Positive
"And that's kind of how this works for us and we try to work our way through this in a sensible way and support our principal customers and work with them on growth, while we try and win as many deals as we can, when and if they come up in the marketplace",Positive
"Hi, Tien-Tsin",Neutral
I remember talking to them some time ago,Neutral
But I'm not going to say much more about it,Neutral
It's a good case study,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"So, right now, it's very early",Neutral
"It can lead to some good volume growth, but what I also visualize over time is the choice coming across to a consumer at the point-of-sale on their phone or from the terminal, whichever way, a choice to make payments from these alternative funding sources",Positive
That's what I think is where all this is going,Neutral
That's the real difference,Neutral
So think of this as layering a cake,Neutral
There is what you can do with the card,Neutral
We're going to do it,Neutral
There is what you can do by adding HomeSend,Neutral
We're going to do it,Neutral
So I'll give you a number for the United Kingdom,Neutral
"I'm going to build it, but what I've got now is the right set of tools between card rails, Send, HomeSend and Fast ACH and as we get together and roll these out sensibly, in sensible profitable ways across the world, you should see us bringing choice and data capability through this to the front end of a B2B business",Positive
"Next question, please?",Neutral
"Those, of course, used at point-of-sale",Neutral
"Now, the acceptance market is growing rapidly in the sense that over the course of this last eight, nine months, you've had a 70%, 80% growth in merchants",Positive
We're still waiting for them to finalize that,Neutral
I am hopeful they will finalize that,Neutral
"Once they do, I think back to the earlier question Lisa asked me about QR codes, I think you will see between traditional terminals, mobile as a point-of-sale and QR codes with dongles, I mean, mobile is a point-of-sale in dongles, and QR codes, I think you will see a reasonably strong expansion of acceptance in India",Positive
"So if we can get our stuff together in the MDR, get the acceptance expansion going, build the right digital tools and QR tools, and roll those out, while also not losing focus on cards, I think there is a really interesting opportunity over the next five to seven years in India",Neutral
So thank you for all your questions,Neutral
We've had a strong first half of the year,Neutral
We're just really pleased to have delivered record revenue and earnings per share in this quarter,Positive
"We've added a number of new capabilities, which we were talking about during the Q&A, which I think differentiate us from competition and they add real value to our merchant and bank customers",Neutral
"Thank you, Sanjay",Neutral
"We had a strong quarter with record revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow, driven by the continued positive industry environment, additional bit growth from our current technologies and progress on deploying our next-generation technologies into manufacturing",Positive
Turning to performance by business unit,Neutral
"The Compute & Networking Business Unit reported fiscal Q3 revenue of $2.4 billion, up 25% sequentially due to increased bit shipments, ongoing success in penetrating growing segments like enterprise, graphics and high-performance memory and cloud and a stronger pricing environment",Positive
revenue growth in the enterprise segment was driven by the continued expansion of DRAM content per server,Positive
"And in the cloud space, we experienced good sequential bit growth",Positive
We saw ongoing growth of our 20-nanometer DDR4 products with particular strength coming from the latest industry server platforms,Positive
"In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer, 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 products",Positive
We also continue to see strong interest in our high-performance memory portfolio,Positive
"Double-digit client revenue growth was driven by a continued firm pricing environment and product mix optimization, resulting in modestly declining bit shipments",Positive
"Graphics also saw double-digit revenue growth, driven by strength in the game console market, as well as new PC graphics card product launches, including the G5X-based Titan Xp from NVIDIA",Positive
"The Mobile Business Unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.1 billion, up 4% sequentially, driven primarily by a stronger pricing environment and our non-GAAP operating income was $304 million or 27% of revenue, up from 16% to prior quarter",Positive
"The results were driven by strong bit demand and increased average selling prices of DRAM, combined with record shipments of SLC and MLC NAND in the consumer and connected home segments and record shipments of DRAM and eMMC NAND into the industrial and automotive segments respectively",Positive
The results were primarily driven by strong unit growth of SSDs and a stronger pricing environment,Positive
Moving to overall company results,Neutral
"revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $5.6 billion, up 20% sequentially and driven by primarily stronger DRAM ASPs and higher NAND bit volumes",Positive
"On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 92%, primarily due to a stronger DRAM pricing environment, increased bit volumes in both DRAM and NAND and our focus on higher value-add solutions to improve our product mix",Positive
"Examples of this improved mix includes SSDs where year-on-year revenue tripled, while in DRAM bits embedded in high-value solution for enterprise, cloud and graphics customers, together grew at a rate twice our overall DRAM bit output for the same period",Positive
"On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 30 percentage points, driven by a stronger DRAM pricing environment, a better product mix and lower cost per bit in both DRAM and NAND",Positive
"As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 DRAM bit output would be about 10% higher than first half fiscal year 2017. As we look forward into fiscal 2018, the timing of the 1x technology transition is expected to result in our bit growth at or slightly below industry growth rates over the same period",Positive
We consider this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2 year bit growth CAGR earlier this year,Positive
"As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 bit growth would be about 30% above first half fiscal year 2017. Based on the timing of technology transitions, we foresee relatively muted bit growth in the first half of fiscal 2018 follow by stronger growth in the second half",Positive
"Consistent with DRAM, we considered this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2 year bit growth CAGRs earlier in the year",Positive
"Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $600 million, down $12 million from the prior year quarter",Negative
"At our Analyst Day in February, we outlined how our production technology execution and the results in bit growth and cost reductions have enabled us to significantly strengthen our cash flow and financial performance in any market conditions",Positive
"However, I wanted to share the tremendous progress we've made over the 12-month period ending in fiscal Q3. During that time, our bit output has been above industry average for both DRAM and trade NAND and our cost per bit has declined approximately 25% and 30% in those technologies respectively",Negative
"With that, I will turn it back to Sanjay",Neutral
So Sanjay may team up for this,Neutral
And we're going to continue to monitor that segment quite carefully from a bit growth perspective,Positive
"In terms of driving our growth ahead, of course, we have several tools available to us",Positive
"But we are, as always, very mindful of operating expenses and operating expense progression",Positive
So we're taking a very close look at that,Neutral
"So consistent with one of the earlier answers, we are in the middle of our planning process for fiscal â€™18 and certainly as we look at some of the priorities of the company, they have always been highly centered around continuing to drive our costs down",Negative
We're still not as flush as I would like to be,Neutral
I would expect it to be increasing over time,Neutral
But at present time that target remains the same,Neutral
Bear in mind that it is a long-term target,Neutral
"And we would expect, if we are successful in continuing to execute on that, that we would be in a position to have greater revenue from those segments which may, depending on the pricing environment, to some degree mitigate a little bit the bit growth profile",Positive
"But bear in min, John, that we talked about our bit growth in context of an industry that we were estimating",Positive
So I do think it's important to keep that in mind,Neutral
"And on the NAND front, we just simply said we would have a little slower growth in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year",Positive
J,Neutral
", we think the industry for calendar '18 could be slightly higher than the range of growth in calendar '17 which is 15% to 20%",Neutral
So maybe add a couple of percentage points to either end of the range,Neutral
And we haven't shared yet bit crossover for 1x,Neutral
So it's just a couple of hundred million dollars,Neutral
"Thank you, Shanye",Neutral
"Good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
We are excited about future opportunities as customers increasingly recognize the strategic value of our memory and storage solutions across a range of high growth markets,Positive
"In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we saw robust growth in Q4 revenue and profitability compared with the prior year",Positive
"Our results were driven by strong demand in Cloud and Graphics, complemented by a healthy pricing environment",Positive
"revenue growth from these two segments significantly exceeded overall CNBU growth, which more than doubled compared with the year ago quarter",Positive
"In Graphics, we continue to leverage our industry leading GDDR5 and GDDR5X performance to address strong demand, primarily from gaming",Positive
"In fiscal Q1, we anticipate continued growth of our 1X portfolio, coincident with the ramp of our second-generation 1X 8-gigabit DDR4 and GDDR5 products, both of which have already been validated at certain partners and customers",Positive
"Fourth quarter revenues in our Mobile Business Unit, were driven by a favorable pricing environment and significant growth in our eMCP business",Positive
"Due to strong execution, sales from our mobile NAND and eMCP solutions nearly doubled year-over-year",Positive
"During the fourth quarter, we also qualified our first 3D TLC eMCP and eMMC solutions at a major chipset vendor and now have dozens of high-density products in qualification with several OEMs. We expect production shipments to start later in 2017. Our 64-layer 3D TLC UFS products will also start OEM qualifications later in 2017, enabling us to participate in the mobile marketâ€™s highest density designs",Neutral
"The Storage Business Unit recorded a revenue increase of 71% in Q4 compared with the prior year quarter, supported by strong demand for our SSD product portfolio",Positive
"As a result, our SSD revenue declined sequentially during the quarter",Negative
Shipments have now restarted and we expect to resume solid sequential SSD revenue growth in Q1. We continued to garner positive momentum with our SSD products across a broad range of customers,Positive
"Demand for our client SSDs is also strong, with Micron shipping solutions to most leading PC OEMs. We see healthy demand trends for SSDs moving forward",Positive
Client SSD attach rates continue to increase,Neutral
"And although storage density growth has slowed temporarily due to a tight pricing environment, we foresee longer term demand for higher density SSDs",Positive
"Our Embedded Business Unit delivered strong performance, growing revenue 39% for the full year",Positive
"We strengthened our leadership position in automotive in fiscal 2017, with growth driven by increasing connectivity and electronics content in vehicles",Positive
The growth in edge analytics in both industrial and consumer connected home applications led to record quarterly revenues in both segments,Positive
"We saw strong growth through the year of our NAND and LPDDR MCP products, driven by form factor and performance needs in applications like machine-to-machine communications, surveillance, drones and home automation",Positive
"Turning to Micronâ€™s technology progress, our 1X DRAM and our 64-layer NAND production rollout is proceeding on plan and we expect to achieve mature yields in both technologies before the end of calendar 2017. We are pleased with our 1Y DRAM technology progress and are focused on the late stages of technology and product development",Positive
"Through successful execution, we expect to narrow our technology cost gap and optimize bit output growth in both DRAM and NAND, with a disciplined focus on profitable growth",Positive
Our ability to successfully execute our technology transition plans will be a key enabler of our cost reduction and supply bit growth capability in the foreseeable future,Positive
"We see DRAM industry supply bit growth of about 20% in calendar 2017 and expect it to grow at relatively similar levels in calendar 2018. The DRAM industry supply demand balance is expected to stay healthy throughout calendar 2018, driven in part by ongoing strength in data center and cloud computing trends",Positive
We expect Micronâ€™s fiscal 2018 DRAM bit output growth to be slightly below the industry growth rate,Positive
"Our bit growth is supported by our 1X DRAM ramp, which represented mid-teens percent of our DRAM bit output in Q4 and will grow throughout the next several quarters to achieve bit output crossover as we exit calendar year 2018. We expect industry NAND bit supply growth to finish calendar 2017 in the high 30% range",Positive
"As the industry continues to transition to 64-layer 3D NAND, we estimate industry bit supply growth in calendar 2018 will approach the 50% range, which should better satisfy the current unfulfilled demand",Positive
We expect that Micronâ€™s ongoing transition to 64-layer 3D NAND in fiscal 2018 will result in bit output growth that is somewhat higher than the industry range,Positive
"Thank you, Ernie",Neutral
We will now open for questions,Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
"As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, bit growth driver for DRAM certainly thatâ€™s outpacing the average growth of the industry is in the area of server and cloud",Positive
And here we are making great penetration with the hyperscale customers in terms of driving the growth of the DRAM business,Positive
"And of course, there is a strong value proposition for SSDs in the cloud and hyperscale data center environment as well given all the trends of artificial intelligence, machine learning, all of this is driving big data analytics",Positive
"So, all these trends are related to artificial intelligence, bit growth in data customers wanting to offer differentiated value to their end customers, all of this is driving need for memory and storage solution and overall, we remain pretty bullish about the demand trends",Positive
"So, I think demand trends for the foreseeable future continued to be strong and that bodes well for our industry",Positive
"I mean, this DRAM and flash is becoming strategic to our customers and our customers are seeing Micron as being uniquely positioned with having a strong portfolio of DRAM as well as flash and being the only company in the Western Hemisphere with those capabilities and that is definitely making us an attractive and valued partner to our customers",Positive
Thank you,Neutral
And you are right to note that the bit growth is going up because of the technology transition in the industry to the 64-layer technology,Positive
"And when we look at the demand trends, those demand tends continue to be strong as I just pointed out related to SSDs as well as increasing average capacities of flash in mobile devices and all kinds of other devices",Positive
"So, demand continues to be strong",Neutral
"Regarding pricing, we donâ€™t specifically for competitive reasons provide comments on pricing on the call, but we just like to point out that we believe that the healthy industry environment as one where price decline is less than or equal to cost declines and we are certainly focused on aggressively reducing our product cost with realizing successfully our technology production ramp of 64-layer",Negative
We have enjoyed the benefits of that,Neutral
Calendar year 2017 as you noted is a great example,Positive
"And you just pointed out the mix of our DRAM business between PC what used to be just about PC and mobile is now very much about PC mobile, server, automotive and multitude of markets and Micron has really great presence, where variety of I mean whole slew of customers and channels",Positive
It has really for long time enjoyed diversified set of global customers and great presence in channels and that is coming into full play as the demand requirements for DRAM continue to grow nicely and into multiple mega-markets,Positive
"And your question regarding floating gate, we have a strong roadmap of future technologies related to floating gate",Positive
"However, in recent times, Micron has made very good progress in this area and we are getting the benefit of that as we are ramping those technologies into production",Positive
"I have said before that these kind of undertakings, driving, accelerated deployment of new technology nodes into volume production and continuing to narrow the gap on the cost front is a multiyear phenomena and we have made very good progress in this regard",Positive
They will continue to be strong growth opportunities for us going forward over the course of next few years,Positive
"So, these demand trends are secular in nature",Neutral
"Sure, Chris",Neutral
"I donâ€™t think there is an inventory issue certainly, if you actually take a look at inventory levels that are reported, which are typically financial numbers and adjust those for dollar cost of how pricing has changed over the course of the year",Neutral
"You do get a bit of a different perspective on inventory as reported by a variety of customers and channel partners in those areas, but the environment continues to be strong",Positive
"And of course, if and when, we were to engage in M&, our focus would, of course we to try to strengthen our future opportunity and make it an opportunity thatâ€™s absolutely provides a strong ROI, beyond that I would not speculate in this matter",Positive
"I mean, we are definitely seeing strong demand trends from â€“ the entire spectrum of our customers a large what you would call Tier 1 or Tier 2 as you termed, although all customers are important to us and we do engage meaningfully with them and we work closely with them to understand their demand requirement and we apply our own judgment to their demand requirements as well in terms of assessing that overall industry demand trends",Positive
I can do that,Neutral
"In fact, enterprise and data center is one of the fastest growth segments for flash in terms of year-over-year bits demand increases that are projected",Positive
"Yes, Mike",Neutral
"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
"Gross margin grew 3%, up 5% in constant currency",Positive
Our investment agility and execution focus resulted in strong performance this quarter,Positive
dollar through the quarter,Neutral
"Our commercial cloud revenue run rate grew to more than $14 billion, up 49%",Positive
"And gross margin dollars grew again, increasing 62% across the commercial cloud",Positive
"This quarter, the strengthening of the U.S",Neutral
Total operating expenses grew 1% and 2% in constant currency,Positive
"Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses declined 2%, also 2% in constant currency",Negative
Now let's turn to each segment,Neutral
"This quarter, revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes LinkedIn, grew 10% and 12% in constant currency to $7.4 billion",Positive
"In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 7% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth again outpaced the shift from the on-premise business",Positive
"Office 365 Commercial revenue increased by 47% or 49% in constant currency, driven by a combination of install base growth across all workloads and ARPU expansion",Positive
"Office Consumer revenue grew 22% or 21% in constant currency, as we continued to see an increase in our subscriber base and growth of recurring subscription revenue",Positive
"In addition, the higher growth rate this quarter was aided by post-launch inventory drawdown in the prior period",Positive
"Segment gross margin dollars grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, while segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud sales mix as well as roughly a point of impact from LinkedIn",Negative
"Operating expenses grew 13%, 14% in constant currency, driven by the LinkedIn acquisition",Positive
"Server products and cloud services grew 12% and 14% in constant currency, with strong momentum in our Azure business and another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth",Positive
"Post-launch demand and purchasing ahead of currency driven pricing adjustments contributed to a higher than expected transactional revenue, mainly from Windows and SQL Server 2016. As expected, Enterprise Services revenue growth declined this quarter 4% and 2% in constant currency due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements",Negative
Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency,Positive
"And segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and a lower Enterprise Services gross margin, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin",Negative
"We grew operating expenses by 12% and 13% in constant currency, with continued investment in cloud engineering, sales capacity, and developer engagement",Positive
"Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, revenue exceeded our expectation at $11.8 billion, primarily from stronger than expected performance from our Windows business",Positive

"For the full year, including LinkedIn, we continue to expect the CapEx growth rate to be lower than last year",Positive

Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book,Negative
"Chris, let's move to Q&A",Neutral
"Yeah, I think Satya is correct",Neutral
"The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS dilution on â€“ excluding the impact of purchase accounting, being minimally dilutive, 1% plus or minus, stands, including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses",Neutral
"As a reminder, the two biggest impacts of purchase accounting, one is it does impact the deferred revenue",Negative
So I think that's how I tend to look at it,Neutral
"Thanks, Heather",Neutral
"And so when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw in Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate, consistently, securely through one interface, you'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud",Neutral
"That 2-point year-over-year increase in the commercial cloud gross margin really, even with the massive growth in Azure over the course of the year, certainly implies the improvement that we expected",Positive
I am sticking with it being about a point,Neutral
That's the guidance we gave,Neutral
That tends to have a very good margin profile,Positive
"And actually, we continue to see the growth in the consumer services around the transactions that run through Xbox is also good margin business for us that looks quite different than the hardware profile",Positive
Thanks,Neutral
"Thanks, Mark",Neutral
That value prop is resonating,Neutral
We saw some growth,Positive
I feel very good about that,Neutral
"Right, I would say actually we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency, 7% before LinkedIn",Positive
So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth,Positive
That 12% or 14% in the server product and services KPI is a very good number,Positive
"And I continue to expect that we'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired, get up to speed, and add value at accounts",Positive
Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be,Positive
And so some of the confidence I think that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense into even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have,Neutral
And so I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making,Neutral
It's starting to pivot to consumed,Neutral
But I think you're right,Neutral
"People often think we focus on cut here, add here",Neutral
"It's also about, are we putting every dollar most efficiently to help customers be successful? And I think that's a lot about what you heard Satya talk about the sales transition we're going through, whether it's how we build products",Neutral
And the ability to earn margin through that is actually more impactful than whether or not you match pricing at the core,Negative
"And in terms of is there a long-term gross margin cloud number that is industry-leading, I think right now there's a benchmark in the SaaS community that's probably around the number you talked about in terms of more SaaS applications",Neutral
"And then as you go down through the layers from PaaS to IaaS, that margin declines, obviously much as it did when that was run as a hardware solution",Negative
And so I do think it will be a blend of those,Neutral
Sure,Neutral
I realize zero to 40% is not as helpful,Neutral
"But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members",Positive
"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone",Neutral

"Now let's turn to the outlook, first FX",Neutral
"Second, our commercial business, the fourth quarter is an important one for our commercial business, and we expect continued annuity growth and healthy renewals as customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of Commercial Cloud services",Positive
"Additionally, we have a large expiry base in the fourth quarter, and our sales execution on renewals and upsell opportunities, while contemplated in our unearned revenue guidance, should also show up in a larger contracted-not-billed balance and commercial bookings growth",Positive
"Quarterly spend variability will continue, and we remain on track for our full-year capital expenditure year-over-year growth curve to slow",Positive
Let's move to the individual segments,Neutral
"In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion, driven by the ongoing annuity shift to cloud and Commercial Office 365. In Office consumer, we expect growth rates to moderate from prior quarters, which were impacted by prior-year comparables",Positive

"And in devices, we expect revenue to decline with negligible revenue from Phone",Negative
We expect COGS of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion,Neutral
"Chris, let's move to Q&A",Neutral
"And I think what you're hearing in that answer from Satya, Keith, is really about whether the premium services exist as you heard at the Azure layer, or whether they show themselves in our Productivity and Business Processes segment",Neutral
"The fact that you may see competition where there may be less differentiation, the real differentiation is where you've always been able to achieve margin and margin expansion, which is in the completeness of the solution or its delivery, the completeness of the business process change or not",Positive
"And so I think while I do understand that people will ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth",Neutral
It can be macro-impacted,Neutral
"And in particular, in this quarter, how to think about I think some of the in-period outperformance versus what we see consistently, in the bucket of consistently, premium workload growth has been consistent for us",Neutral
"The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us, and that I think is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter to quarter",Neutral
Japan happens to be one of those geos,Neutral
"So that's how I break down the drivers, Mark",Neutral
So that's what I would think of on ASC 606.,Neutral
I answered them in the opposite order,Neutral
"Great, let me take both of those",Neutral
I think the important part in what Satya says is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and world view on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments,Neutral
"And so things that used to look more to them like capital expense or COGS or not just an IT budget, this is literally changing every business process they run or changing the services they offer, and thinking about literally driving their revenue differently",Neutral
Thanks,Neutral
"In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track",Positive
"And the way you've seen that, and I'll relate it to margins, is this continued and consistent installed base growth, and even still having the opportunities Satya laid out",Positive
"So we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3. And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving",Neutral
I do think here the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement is continuing raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow,Neutral

"Operating cash flow increased due to higher collections from customers following strong billings growth, as well as working capital improvements in our hardware business",Positive
Now letâ€™s turn to the outlook,Neutral
"At the company level, our gross margin percentage should decline about a point in FY 2018 with increasing cloud revenue mix, a full year of LinkedIn amortization and hardware launches, including our new console, Xbox One X",Negative
You should think about our FY 2018 operating expenses in two categories,Neutral
"First, organic Microsoft expenses, which we expect to grow between 3% and 4%, reflecting the investments we are making to support our top line growth",Positive
"Second, LinkedIn",Neutral
We are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth,Positive
"Importantly, we expect our company operating margin to only decline by about a point as we continue to grow our cloud revenue, we fund new investment to support growth in strategic areas and absorb $1.5 billion of LinkedIn amortization in COGS and OpEx",Negative
"Next, our effective tax rate",Neutral
"As a reminder, our tax rate is impacted by at least three major factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests",Negative
"Based on current FX rates, we expect less than 1 point of negative impact on revenue growth overall and for each segment",Positive
"Office 365 commercial revenue growth will continue to be driven by install base growth, ARPU expansion, and adoption of premium services like E5, and should outpace the rate of transactional decline",Negative
We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business given prior year comparables,Positive
"Customer demand for Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings remains strong, and we anticipate another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services",Positive
"Enterprise Services should decline, given lower volumes of custom support agreements",Negative
Devices revenue growth will continue to be impacted by the prior year phone comparable,Positive
"In Search, Bingâ€™s revenue growth ex-TAC should be similar to prior quarters",Positive
And with that letâ€™s go to Q&A,Neutral
"If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter in Q4, we felt very good about cloud demand across all three services, but in particular with Azure",Positive
I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin improvement across all those services,Neutral
"I feel confident in our ability to continue to make progress on our overall commercial cloud gross margin growth, and I am encouraged by the demand signals we are getting",Neutral
"And I think in many ways Keith what we have done is a really a natural extension of some of the investments weâ€™ve made over the past 18 months to add technical resources to be more present in customer accounts, to really drive their transformation towards success outcomes",Neutral
Weâ€™re taking that learning over the past 18 months and really applying it at a broader scale across the sales force to put those resources where we feel confident that they will have a good long-term return in that next phase of transformation,Neutral
Thanks Karl,Neutral
Let me make sure I cover of on most of those,Neutral
"Let me start by saying, the biggest driver in commercial bookings growth this quarter was excellent execution on a large base of renewals",Positive
"The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall",Positive
"While we saw improvement in the gross margin percentage in Office 365 and continue to make progress on that it is also the balance, right",Positive
"So, I actually feel very good, but as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory that you are not seeing frankly much impact on the gross margin line and we are seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line",Neutral
"When you think about, you are right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it, and for the year on a pure basis it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue",Neutral
"But you also saw - and what really does matter, especially in Azure is usage of growth, really consumption growth having customers use deploy, be successful, and really continue to get you think sort of meters up and running and that continues to build on itself, and so when you start to see that you can, and I do think and we will continue to see good growth in this number",Neutral
"Next, I think across every service the momentum weâ€™ve seen in Q4 and in particular, I would say, I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows E5, advanced threat protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings",Neutral
We really did see strength across all of them,Neutral
Why don't you start and I will do the next one,Neutral
"And so to your point and itâ€™s a nice transition from Satya's point about, especially the midmarket offering coming in the fall for Microsoft 365 is installed base growth",Positive
"I think we are optimistic as we head into FY 2018 for the installed base growth possible in particular for some of these midmarket offerings that weâ€™re quite proud off The ARPU growth that you saw and have seen in the past couple of quarters continues to primarily, Phil, be related still to the E1 to E3 transition",Neutral
Thanks Kash,Neutral
"Let me go through the bookings, again with that 30% the first and best contributor to that is the strong performance on the renewals in quarter",Positive
"and Germany they did have very good years in particular in Q4. Now if you separate the fact that we had the larger base with clearly contribute to that bookings number being big, aside from that in particular Azure in the last year point did really show up in that 18.9, it didn't, the strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide and it was significant, a lot of that is the Azure fillings",Positive
I would also say across geo,Neutral
"And so while we of course get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors if it was actually quite broad there is not only one place for me to say that we just saw it here, and then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and the way youâ€™d see that cash, again versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there with that final piece around our security value prop, ATP - Windows annuity growth was very good",Neutral
"And I think maybe, I should have also mentioned, when you think about seeing that type of performance and Satya mentioned it is not just because of work done this quarter, it is a great point, but itâ€™s also the investments weâ€™ve made",Positive
We added technical resources,Neutral
"We put resources at customers ahead of the curve, we did that you saw that and the operating in the intelligent cloud OpEx growth over the past few quarters, that execution is whatâ€™s landing",Positive
"And so I think, we remain confident that double-digit target that we have for that KPI and is it really, I don't think sort of a comparability challenge per se, but thatâ€™s why we try to keep it at that high level to not get too tied to one or the other, given we know the TAM expansion thatâ€™s possible, we know we can grow within it",Neutral
So I wouldn't expect any material impact,Neutral
Thanks Brad,Neutral
"The way I tend to think about it is, with any service you want the gross margin itself to improve, and that includes in the Azure services components themselves",Neutral
"Anyhow, we saw significant improvement this year",Neutral
"And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but thatâ€™s why I tend to not focus at that layer itâ€™s like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time youâ€™d expect a higher mix of premium versus core",Neutral

Asia Pac was up 2% on strong product performance driven by P25 demand in Australia,Positive
"Services was down on lower systems integration, while Managed & Support Services was up",Negative
I'd like to end with some notable highlights,Neutral
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg,Neutral
"And Tavis, this is Gino",Neutral
"But as expected and recall during our last call, the guidance, our expectation was for gross margin to be down, driven primarily by a few things",Negative
"Greg mentioned and I mentioned in prepared remarks, the strength of systems in North America, as well as some ERP-related â€“ ERP implementation-related cost in Q2. So Q2 margin down approximately 160 basis points, spread across really those three issues",Negative
Margins through the first half are comparable,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
"I think it represents, at this point, an estimate for the composite total revenue",Neutral
So it's all of the above,Neutral
"It's a best guess, by the way",Neutral
"Most important of that is less the composition of how it comes in by product or software bucket but it assumes a certain loading level, a certain penetration level that we think is reasonable",Neutral
But we'll have a better view of it in Q1.,Neutral
Sure,Neutral
"Rod, this is Gino",Neutral
It was purposeful,Neutral
"Kulbinder, this is Gino",Neutral
Just a couple of comments,Neutral
That's the way as you described it,Neutral
"For Q3, Andrew?",Neutral
Or for the full year?,Neutral
Go ahead,Neutral
"So Andrew, we'll start with the year",Neutral
"Certainly, for the full year, our expectation is for growth and growth in both Products and Services and organic growth",Positive
On 3% to 4% for the full year?,Neutral
I'm not sure,Neutral
"Maybe we'll go through the model and your math, Andrew",Neutral
I'm not sure,Neutral
"GAAP operating earnings of $338 million, down $3 million from last year, non-GAAP operating earnings were $423 million, up 7% or $27 million from the prior year",Negative
This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth,Positive
"The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth continues to be driven by North America, which had 13 P25 system orders valued at over $10 million each",Positive
Our Managed & Support services revenue grew 8%,Positive
"Services operating income was $136 million or 20.7% of sales, down from 25% last year",Negative
The Q3 effective tax rate was 29.9%,Neutral
We expect Q4 revenue growth of approximately 3% with non-GAAP EPS between $2 and $2.05. We now expect full-year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% versus our previous forecast of 3% to 4%,Positive
"Full-year operating expenses are expected to be $1.48 billion, down approximately $15 million from 2016, including approximately $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions",Negative
"Looking at regional results; Americas revenue was up 9%, driven by organic growth of 5% in North America",Positive
"This growth was driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services, as well as demand for PCR products, serving commercial customers",Positive
"EMEA was up 6% on strong demand in products, while backlog was down from the Airwave revenue conversion",Positive
com website and AT&T's speed portal,Neutral
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg,Neutral
"Sure, Stanley",Neutral
I'll start with full year organic growth,Positive
"Embedded in that number is organic growth of between 2% and 3% and that includes iDEN down $45 million in 2017. With respect to FX for the full year, it's de minimis",Positive
Vijay,Neutral
"Kyle, this is Gino",Neutral
Q4 will still be our largest quarter,Neutral
"Thanks, Kyle",Neutral
"Thanks, Kris",Neutral
Our innovation in emerging areas of the market is expanding and creating new growth opportunities for us,Positive
"As we deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, we remain focused on three priorities",Positive
"And third, a robust capital allocation program, which includes the mix of share buybacks, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business",Positive
I'll begin with an update on our first priority,Neutral
Ron will update you on the other two,Neutral
Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined 18% year-over-year,Negative
"As we've said in the past, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen, allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Consistent with the plan we've laid out and as you saw in our Q3 results and Q4 guidance included in our press release, the momentum of our strategic solutions is already delivering top line growth",Positive
Clustered ONTAP continues to perform very well,Neutral
"And our growth in flash continues to outpace both the market and our competition, large and small",Positive
"In our third quarter, our all-flash array business grew 160% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $1.4 billion, inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire product and services",Positive
"This year, we have refreshed our entire all-flash FAS portfolio with the A-Series designed specifically for flash and are experiencing strong adoption of these new products",Positive
SolidFire creates an avenue of growth for us to address customers' data requirements as they build out next-generation data centers,Positive
We are further leveraging our SolidFire investment and expanding our growth potential by developing the next generation of hyper-converged infrastructure built on SolidFire innovation,Positive
A large U.S,Neutral
"With continued execution, we're on track to increase shareholder value and return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin range",Positive
We hope that you'll be able to join us,Neutral
Our success in all-flash arrays is broad and wide,Neutral
It's less than 10% of the deployed install base,Neutral
So we've got lots of headroom to go,Neutral
Let me take the first question,Neutral
So they compete aggressively on price,Neutral
I'll just leave it there,Neutral
"Overall, strategic products were up 22% year-on-year, so we saw really strong growth",Positive
"Our all-flash array number includes products and services, right? I think when you think about all-flash versus hybrid flash arrays, I mean, they're essentially solutions we offer customers",Neutral
NVMe will become just like fiber channel,Neutral
So we remain committed to doing that,Neutral
"As we think about the savings that we generate, we'll continue to look at all of the options that are in front of us, right? Returning some of that through improved profitability to shareholders, as well as investing in the long-term growth of the business",Neutral
"I think in terms of the systems, life cycle continues to expand, right? So I think the continued extension of life cycle is what causes the install base to have legs and growth, right, in addition to the product revenue growth that we're seeing now, so",Neutral
Okay,Neutral
"I think in terms of our approach to media prices, we've generally taken the position that we will pass on whatever cost structure being offered to us, benefit or disadvantage, from the media manufacturers to our customers",Neutral
"I think the competitiveness of the product portfolio, the fact that we enable our channel partners to have a rich base of margin-rich services associated with the business that they're doing with NetApp continues to make us a compelling value proposition to our partners",Neutral
So there's a slight adjustment for that,Neutral
The second question was on amortization,Neutral
We have a broad book of business around the world,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
We expect the trend to continue the same,Neutral
"I think through the course of the quarter, we saw a strong year-end budget flush",Positive
And what we've always said is we anticipate returning the company to moderated revenue growth,Positive
"Our focus on transformation allows that moderated revenue growth to generate substantial returns to shareholders, and we're delivering on that commitment right now",Positive
"We've made solid progress in Clustered ONTAP in terms of transitioning our install base, and are doing so with greater operating margin leverage",Positive
We think that's what the market wants,Neutral
It isn't a net new market that we serve,Neutral
Kulbinder S,Neutral
The transformation of NetApp is yielding solid results with the return to top line growth and increasing profitability,Positive
"Good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
Thank you for joining us today,Neutral
"I am very pleased to report another strong quarter with revenue above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share all above our guidance",Positive
We saw a solid demand environment in all geographies and strong customer interest in our industry-leading solutions,Positive
I am proud of our continued progress in transforming NetApp to deliver sustained profitable growth,Positive
Our strong performance reflects our customers' commitment to NetApp and their clear and growing preference for the value of our Data Fabric strategy,Positive
"In the second quarter, we launched innovative new products and grew our business in new areas",Positive
"We enable customers to meet the exponential data growth of the digital era where they must manage a complex hybrid world with data in the data center, the cloud and in edge computing, and externally linked applications and platforms",Positive
"In the second quarter, product revenue from mature solutions declined 3% year-over-year",Negative
"In the coming quarters, the headwinds for mature solutions could abate and could possibly provide some support for additional top line growth",Positive
This has resulted in a differentiated strategic solutions portfolio focused on the growth areas of the market,Positive
"We continue to substantially outpace the growth of the all-flash array market and competitors, both large and small",Positive
"In Q2, our all-flash array business, inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services, grew about 60% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.7 billion",Positive
The all-flash FlexPod again helped to strengthen our number two position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 20% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC's Quarterly Converged Systems Tracker for calendar Q2 2017. We continue to outpace and win against full stack vendors with our best-of-breed solution,Positive
"The latest version of ONTAP offers 40% increased performance over earlier versions, helps companies increase capacity savings by 30% and offers stronger security and new compliance capabilities",Positive
Customers are excited that we are delivering on all of the promises of HCI and we are seeing strong demand for this offering,Positive
We are building on a solid foundation that is generating profitable growth today and positions us for continued growth in the future,Positive
We remain focused on three priorities,Neutral
"And we are maintaining our focus on capital allocation, balancing shareholder returns with investment in the business for long-term growth",Positive
Our second quarter results are a strong indicator that the transformation of NetApp remains on track and is accelerating our success with customers,Positive
It's clear that our strong execution and Data Fabric strategy are enabling us to build deeper and more strategic relationships with companies around the world,Positive
Ron?,Neutral
"I think we're very, very pleased with the performance of our sales team",Positive
It has exceeded our expectations,Neutral
So we've got really good momentum,Neutral
And we see a lot of customer interest,Neutral
"We continue to see very, very good momentum displacing competition to gain wallet share",Positive
We still see substantial room to run,Neutral
"We have several world-record performance benchmarks, a deeply differentiated software portfolio, and we continue to see strong momentum going forward",Positive
I won't break out the hyper-converged,Neutral
That's a 2019 phenomenon,Neutral
But I do think it will be an additional growth driver for the company,Neutral
"I think the way I look at it we are riding several long-term secular trends: data growth and the criticality of data in a digital business; major technological transitions like solid-state storage, converged infrastructure and the cloud",Neutral
And our execution has been really strong,Neutral
And we see strong momentum heading into the second half of the year,Positive
We saw good momentum in the public sector market,Neutral
"So, defense and intelligence were strong, reflecting the budget allocations that they received",Positive
It was very strong across all of the geographies,Neutral
Cisco continues to be a really strong partner of NetApp,Positive
Our strength in flash combined with the capabilities of the UCS and intent-based networking from Cisco is driving meaningful growth in the FlexPod business,Positive
"First of all, I think the 7% number is correct",Neutral
"As we mentioned before, we see, in the normal seasonality of the business, the revenue growth rate to accelerate through the second half of the year, and this is consistent despite the fact that we've had a strong first half and it reflects our continued momentum",Positive
"It reflects the broad book of business that we're seeing, reflective of the mature solutions just posted a 23% year-on-year growth, growth; the strategic solutions just posted 23% year-on-year growth",Positive
"With regard to FX, I'll have Ron comment on that",Neutral
"I think, first of all, the 7% number was aggregate revenue, not product revenue",Neutral
"I think that is aligned with customers' spending priorities and it is the best investment protection argument that any vendor in the marketplace can offer customers, which is, you can start with us on the cloud and move your data on premises",Neutral
"In addition, our individual solutions that underpin the Data Fabric are also very strong",Positive
We've got a compelling offering for SAN,Neutral
The converged infrastructure portfolio is really strong and expanding with both Fujitsu and the hyper-converged,Positive
"It's always competitive, Sherri",Neutral
I think every transaction is competitive,Neutral
"I think we have a differentiated software portfolio and a long-term strategy, as well as I do want to congratulate our field organization on sales discipline that allows us to apply pricing discipline selectively where we need it, right? But every transaction remains competitive",Neutral
"First of all, thanks for your question",Neutral
"With regard to hyper-converged, I think that that's an opportunity for net new customer acquisition, net new workload capture and primarily at the expense of direct-attached storage or alternate storage solution from our competitors, and so we do see hyper-converged being additive to our installed base",Neutral
So we think that that's adding an upside (48:34),Neutral
"Thank you everyone, and thank you, Kris",Neutral
The transformation of NetApp to deliver sustained profitable growth is on track and yielding positive results,Positive
"In the second quarter, we introduced a number of industry-leading innovations that position us for continued growth and expand upon our leadership position",Positive
"Thanks, Shawn",Neutral
We had a strong start to the year,Neutral
"Overall, quarterly revenue reached $1.94 billion, up 48% from the year earlier, down 11% sequentially and above our outlook of $1.9 billion",Negative
"From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 45% to $1.56 billion from a year earlier, and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $332 million",Positive
Let's start with our gaming platforms,Neutral
"Gamers continue to show great interest in the Pascal-based GPUs, including gaming notebooks",Positive
Our Tegra gaming platform also did extremely well,Neutral
Gaming continues to be driven by the headlong growth in e-sports,Positive
male millennials as America's favorite pastime,Neutral
Great reviews and reports of the system selling out in many geographies are a strong part of this platform,Positive
"Moving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew to $205 million, up 8% from a year ago, amid continued demand for high-end real-time rendering and more powerful mobile workstations",Positive
Navy's most advanced ships,Neutral
"Driving growth was demand from cloud service providers and enterprises building training clusters for web services, plus strong gains in high-performance computing, GRID graphics virtualization, and our DGX-1 AI super-computer",Positive
"Our GRID graphics virtualization business more than tripled, driven by growth in business services, education, and automotive",Positive
"Finally, automotive, revenue grew to a record $140 million, up 24% year over year and 9% sequentially, primarily from infotainment modules",Positive
"We expect our DRIVE PX 2 AI platform to be capable of delivering Level 3 autonomy for cars, trucks, and shuttles by the end of the year, with Level 4 autonomy moving into production by the end of 2018. Now turning to the rest of the Q1 income statement, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter were 59.4% and 59.6% respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue",Negative
"Non-GAAP operating expenses were $517 million, up 17% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiative",Positive
"We have 550-plus talks, more than half on AI",Neutral
We will now open the call for questions,Neutral
Please limit your questions to two,Neutral
Thanks for the question,Neutral
I think you'll hear more about that tomorrow,Neutral
"Thanks, Gabrielle",Neutral
Payments are rapidly digitizing,Neutral
Mobile is re-defining the phase of retail,Neutral
We believe all of these secular trends play into our strengths and leave us well positioned to drive our future growth,Positive
"At the end of a land mark year for PayPal, we feel well positioned to deliver sustainable and profitable growth in 2017 and beyond",Positive
"This is at the high-end of our guidance of 16% to 19% growth, and we generated $771 million in free cash flow",Positive
"For the full year we delivered $1.50 of non-GAAP EPS, which came in at the top of our initial full-year guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. Our revenues grew 21% on a pro forma FX neutral basis above our initial 2016 guidance of 19%",Positive
"And despite the increased size of our revenue base, we grew faster in 2016 than in 2015. We ended the year at $10.84 billion of revenue and we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, well above the initial guidance we provided",Positive
"Perhaps more importantly, the underlining drivers of our revenue growth saw continued strong performance throughout 2016. We ended the year with $197 million active customer accounts, adding 5.4 million new accounts in Q4, our highest organic total in two years",Positive
Our growth in Q4 came from across our global platform and we benefited from a notable shift in consumer behavior,Positive
"We saw strong growth in peer-to-peer payments, with P2P payment volume growing 57%, more than $64 billion for the year",Positive
"In December, for the first, Venmo passed the 2 billion mark in monthly payment volume further demonstrating its rapid growth",Positive
One Touch has redefined online checkout,Neutral
Its adoption has well exceeded our projections,Neutral
eBay CEO Devin Wenig and I are committed to further strengthening what is already a strong relationship,Positive
"In the quarter, we were also proud to welcome several great brands to our platform",Positive
This in turn has a recast to competitive landscape for PayPal and enables landmark partnerships and alliances that continue to expand and extend our opportunity for growth,Positive
"These partnerships are focused on giving consumers the freedom and flexibility to use PayPal anywhere they want, in stores, in apps, online and a new context for the consistent, convenient, and secure experience, following the announcements of our strategic partnership with Visa on our Q2 earnings call and MasterCard in Q3. In the fourth quarter, we announced our first partnership agreement with financial institutions",Neutral
This is just the beginning,Neutral
2016 was a transformative year for PayPal,Neutral
She has been a key architect in their growth and has held to chart new business approaches and innovative customer experiences,Positive
Sheâ€™s already proving to be a great addition to our board and we look forward to her valuable contributions,Positive
"And with that, let me hand it over to John",Neutral
"So, we are taking off our revenue guidance on an FX neutral basis and the reason we are doing that is there is a tremendous amount of secular tailwinds that we are seeing right now",Positive
"I mean a great example of that is this was the best retail holiday season in five years, but you saw - in-store sales actually drop and online move up to almost 17%, 18% or so",Positive
"And so as we look at these secular tailwinds behind us, we look at the performance of things like One Touch and its clear advantage that we have now in mobile and the scale we have the increased engagement we are seeing",Positive
So there are a host of reasons right now that our confidence has improved in terms of our top line growth rate and by the way thatâ€™s also lacking 200 million of Xoom,Positive
"So think about that, as well as you think about kind of the revenue guidance we gave",Neutral
"So, we think they are good prospects ahead of us",Neutral
Bryan itâ€™s Dan,Neutral
"We don't need to chase growth here, we can be very responsible and who we lend to and how much we lend to them",Positive
And we have great amounts of data and really I think world class modeling around this,Positive
"The size of our basement doesn't have credit and the ability to expand that is very attractive and the risk involving capabilities we have also very attractive, and so there are a lot of economics here to share and we believe that we can significantly reduce our risk exposure, but maintain strong economics for our business",Positive
"We are in the early process of looking through this right now because it is a very competitive process out there as people look to potentially partner with us, you know we look to make a decision as we digest and sort through all the different proposals that weâ€™re seeing, that said very much likely to be a - if we go and how we do this exactly with the back half of 2017 event, but clearly there is a lot of demand, there is a lot of benefits for us moving towards asset light and we think as I mentioned you reduce risk and maintain strong economics for the business",Positive
Let me try and jump the two questions in there,Neutral
"Mobile, mobile is driving growth in the industry right now",Positive
0.87,Neutral
"So, I had spent mobile to continue to fewer our growth",Positive
"So expect that to, not particular what the growth rate will be one way or the other, but mobile is going to be a strong driver of growth and itâ€™s a big differentiator for us",Positive
"So, like I say in terms of Venmo monetization pricing very little actually built into our guidance for 2017. We fully intend to rollout out Venmo, previous Venmo in a much broader basis in 2017. And we will see some impact in that, but really the big impact on that happens in 2018 and 2019. And so just see that and thatâ€™s, when we talk about feeling well positioned or profitable growth in 2017 and beyond itâ€™s because what we're seeing right now are things that we clearly see here and now and we've got a ton of things that we think we can monetize and fully intend to go due, but letâ€™s model them in more in the 2018 timeframes adhere and so not much is built into that",Positive
"We rolled that choice through all of North America, right now on the servicing piece of choice, as well as the on boarding of that, we are just beginning in checkout right now, but as John mentioned in his remarks from a cost perspective it is well within our expectations in terms of transaction expense and engagement, it is better than we expected in terms of engagement which by the way is not really surprising",Neutral
It's Dan,Neutral
"So, thank you very much for your time",Neutral
"Thank you, Gabrielle",Neutral
And thanks everyone for joining us today,Neutral
"Iâ€™m pleased to say that PayPal delivered another strong quarter of financial results, achieving new milestones for the Company on multiple fronts",Positive
"PayPal generated 3.136 billion in revenue, the first time we've exceeded 3 billion in a single quarter and representing 20% of FX-neutral growth, nearly a 110 basis point acceleration from the first quarter and 70 basis points from a year ago",Positive
Our non-GAAP operating margin grew by a 110 basis point year-over-year to 21%,Positive
Perhaps more importantly we had strong performance across our customer metrics,Positive
Our volume growth was driven by our leadership in mobile,Positive
This growth is largely driven by the exceptional and differentiated consumer experiences we enabled on mobile devices,Positive
"Based on the strong trends we're seeing across the business, we're once again raising guidance for revenue and EPS for the full year",Positive
Based on the success of choice in the U.S,Neutral
"The accelerating and extensive scale of our two sided global platform, which will allow consumers and merchants to transact instantly in new context, across operating system, technologies and platforms, create a strong foundation and is very attractive to multiple partners",Positive
"Just like the deployment of One Touch, this great new checkout experience will be available to millions of PayPal merchants without requiring any integration work from the merchant, further extending the value we bring to our merchant customers",Positive
", Australia and parts of Europe",Neutral
Users of Samsung Pay in the U.S,Neutral
"The ability to deliver new consumers and enhanced sales growth to merchants of all sizes is a key benefit of PayPal, especially as the world becomes more global and increasingly digital",Positive
"Three years ago, we set off to transform PayPal",Neutral
Our execution in support of that vision is yielding strong results and expanding our leadership position,Positive
"Dan, itâ€™s Dan on",Neutral
Nice to hear you and thanks for the question,Neutral
"And if you look under the covers what weâ€™ve done here quite a bit, the news is even better because the majority of our user engagement right now is coming from the core PayPal Wallet and in many prices before it was coming from growth of Braintree and core PayPal",Positive
But now it is being driven the majority from our PayPal core wallet and that is a great story for us,Positive
"And if you look at our product growth and our core PayPal franchise over the last several quarters, weâ€™ve taken multi-year trend that have been drifting slightly down in terms of their real growth year-over-year and we have bent these curves across pretty much every single one of our core products and they're now up and accelerating",Positive
So also you'll see that drive up,Neutral
TIO just came on,Neutral
"Our new partnerships with Facebook and Google are going to start to kick in, that's really not in our guidance right now, as they -- those things are going to start to accelerate and drive our future growth as we look into '18, '19, '20. So, we still have a goal that would consumer use PyaPal two times a week",Positive
Correlate with it and I admire that,Neutral
"And that's happening because we're going to drive growth for them, as John mentioned in his remarks, our MS TPV -- our TPV growth outside of eBay is growing at 30% and we're the perfect digital distribution channel for financial institutions especially now that we've implemented choice",Positive
"And so I think this acceleration of our net new actives is coming at a lower cost to it, so it's really found sort of one-two punch thatâ€™s positive for us now, but especially as we look forward",Neutral
People have used Vodafone and PayPal in-store,Neutral
I'll start then maybe Bill can supplement,Neutral
"So, I would say and as I mentioned in my remarks, there's no one single thing driving the growth of those net new active",Positive
So we see a continued strength in net new active,Neutral
"That's coming as a result and Bill won't say this, but I will from the great work that Bill and his product and engineering teams have done, great work that have done",Positive
"And as I mentioned, we're bending multiyear curves now and weâ€™re seeing now really nice year-over-year growth in our core experiences",Positive
That matters a lot,Neutral
We got a new mobile app there,Neutral
We got One Touch,Neutral
We got choice coming in,Neutral
"Choice is driving both reduction in churn which helps to net new actives obviously, but itâ€™s also driving additional new adds because the on-boarding process is so much more streamlined, and then you also have partners that are now actively marketing PayPal because together we're sort of allies in advancing digital payments and tapping into that growth",Positive
"I think what Bill and the risk teams have done and things like One Touch have really been an unparalleled kind of a mobile checkout experience, almost two times the conversion of the industry average",Neutral
"We obviously bring our scale to partners and when you talk to different platforms whether it'd be Baidu or Google or Samsung, the ability to tap into 17 million merchants we have that long tail of merchants, that's a very difficult asset for others to replicate and it's accelerating in its growth",Positive
"If you look at other partnerships, we can add potential for pretty significant additional growth for them, whether that's driven by mobile and we can do a One Touch or TPV that's accelerating",Positive
On the M&A front because you got two questions in there in a very subtle way,Neutral
"But on the M&A front, look we've a very strong balance sheet",Positive
So thatâ€™s the competitive advantage for us,Neutral
They got to accelerate our progress either against the key vertical or geographic expansion,Positive
It was a means to an end that they have,Neutral
I'll start off with that,Neutral
"We both see a lot of value in it, if two very strong companies lending what are really impressive assets to create consumer experiences, including as you mentioned processing through Chase Net which obviously does give the potential",Positive
"You have X number of reward points, but maybe couldnâ€™t do that full transaction",Neutral
"Okay, so thank you for that last question, Bryan",Neutral
And thanks everybody for joining us,Neutral
Thanks a lot everybody and thank you operator,Neutral
"Thanks, Marc",Neutral
"Obviously, this was an exceptional quarter",Neutral
"In FY 2017, we drove tremendous execution, growth of scale and delivered unprecedented customer success",Positive
Number one was the focus on industry,Neutral
"Very, very important",Neutral
"And the last was building the world's strongest ecosystem in the cloud, and that was with our SI partners and our ever-expanding ISV community",Positive
Pretty incredible progress,Neutral
"Now, let's talk about some of the highlights in the quarter, starting with our industry strategy, again one of our growth pillars",Positive
We had strong growth in Q4 in all of our target industries,Positive
"In Q4, we expanded relationships with U.S",Neutral
"Bank, SunTrust, TD Bank and many, many more",Neutral
Healthcare continues to be strong for us,Neutral
It's been less than a year since they've been GA and we've already seen great traction,Positive
"Now on to international, our second growth strategy",Positive
"So today, nearly 30% of our revenue is outside of the Americas and this represents a huge, huge growth opportunity for us",Positive
"We drove strong financial services momentum as well, again, in the industry with 5 of the top 15 banks in Europe this quarter including Banco Santander and BCC, again, all running their business on salesforce",Positive
"So great progress, again, on the international front",Positive
We have an incredible partnership with them,Neutral
We're also seeing strong momentum in our ISV community and the innovation around our platform in that community,Positive
We are driving incredible innovation,Neutral
We're bringing huge value to our customers,Neutral
We continue to inspire our customers,Neutral
"And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark",Neutral
"Kash, hi, it's Keith",Neutral
So thank you for the complex multipart question,Neutral
I'll lead off with this part,Neutral
"So as you know, we did a dozen plus acquisitions in FY 2017; the integration has gone incredibly well as we continue to operate the company at scale and growth",Positive
We want to grow them,Neutral
We want to nurture them,Neutral
We've seen some great success,Positive
"A good example of that is the Demandware acquisition, now called Commerce Cloud",Positive
The GMV growth was excellent,Positive
We signed up some great business in the quarter,Positive
"Obviously, pioneer in cloud, and bringing sales Cloud to the market 18 years ago was a great start",Positive
It was a first act,Neutral
Many companies never get beyond that first act,Neutral
"We've gotten beyond the first act, the second act, the third act, the fourth act, and we're well into our fifth act-plus around innovation and Einstein is certainly a great example of that",Positive
"If I looked at use cases for Einstein, overall, I would tell you that this is really bringing insight to action across sales and service and marketing and commerce, if you think about opportunity insights or account insights, predictability scoring, et cetera, et cetera",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"So, hi, it's Keith, let me take this",Neutral
So this is an ongoing thing,Neutral
"And specifically on Service Cloud, look, we're the market leader, okay? So we had amazing growth",Positive
The Magic Quadrant,Neutral
This is a $2.5 billion run rate business,Neutral
"And again, we're taking market share",Neutral
We're number one in the marketplace,Neutral
So we've got incredible capabilities,Neutral
Let me talk about that,Neutral
And that is where we are laser-focused,Neutral
So that means it wasn't just sales Cloud,Neutral
"So again, customers are buying solutions",Neutral
So we're in a great product position,Positive
Absolutely,Neutral
I think it's listening,Neutral
They are expanding their relationships,Neutral
They are betting their business on salesforce,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
So this is Keith,Neutral
"Look, we talked about this earlier",Neutral
There's a number of reasons for that,Neutral
So there's a lot of momentum,Neutral
We're very excited,Neutral
"We've got a great story, a compelling vision for our customers and we continue to execute in an unprecedented way, better than anybody else in the marketplace",Positive
"Marc, I don't know if you want to add",Neutral
"Thank you so much, John",Neutral
I really appreciate it,Neutral
Thank you very much for allowing me to say that,Neutral
"And now, Iâ€™d like to move into the quarter",Neutral
"While this was a phenomenal quarter of growth, we continue to improve our profitability, executing at scale and we remain the fastest-growing of all the top five enterprise software companies",Positive
"Based on these strong results, we are raising full year top-line revenue guidance by $100 million to $10.4 billion at the high end of the range, 24% growth for this dream, and I will tell you personally, Iâ€™ve got dreams of 25%",Positive
This is a massive $1 trillion growth opportunity,Positive
"Okay, Keith",Neutral
Thank you very much for asking that question,Neutral
"I think that when we think about earnings, and obviously we have this incredible top line growth, and there is one word that really comes to mind and thatâ€™s balance, which is that itâ€™s incredibly important as we grow our company and exceed these incredible revenue targets that we also continue to grow our bottom-line",Neutral
"Mark, do you want to address?",Neutral
Iâ€™d like to think of this investing in growth by design and enhancing our profitability every step of the way,Neutral
One area that I am especially proud of is mobile,Neutral
"So, itâ€™s a very extremely powerful",Neutral
"I think that number one for us, here we are, weâ€™re blasting through $10 billion, all of you have your models for salesforce, you can plug these preferred revenue numbers into your models and do your calculations of where our revenues going to be in each of the next several years",Neutral
Thatâ€™s certainly chapter two,Neutral
"We have a great culture at salesforce, itâ€™s a culture built on our core values of trust, of growth, of innovation, of quality",Positive
"And I think thatâ€™s why youâ€™re going to see extraordinary growth for years to come, because of this culture thatâ€™s really driving it forward",Neutral
"As I said, weâ€™re here forecasting 24% growth for the year thatâ€™s our official guidance",Positive
I have personal dreams of 25%,Neutral
I think that would be amazing,Neutral
"And so, when we chart, we had a chart couple of weeks ago, Microsoftâ€™s growth over 30 years, salesforceâ€™s growth, Oracleâ€™s growth, SAP growth and wow, we really separated ourselves from those traditional growth trajectories",Positive
"Well, the platform strategy has evolved over time",Neutral
We donâ€™t do that,Neutral
"I think one of the reasons we have been able to deliver so quickly this amazing work and financial services that Keith has led, which is the building of our financial services cloud and our financial services business unit is -- and our success in financial services is because of our platform, rapidly",Neutral
And that is built on Heroku,Neutral
Thatâ€™s a great example of our platform strategy where we let customers build highly complex applications like Louis Vuitton with their icon app and you can see that inside any Louis Vuitton store when you go into work with a Louis Vuitton account executive and you can see it yourself as a consumer with Heroku when you use LV Pass on your phone,Positive
I hope that answers your question,Neutral
"I think itâ€™s a critical part of how we differentiate our product against now all of our competitors because weâ€™re the first company to take the robust AI capabilities including machine intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, and offer that to our customers in a unified CRM platform through our sales, service, marketing applications, commerce applications across the board",Neutral
"With AI, I have seen some amazing things",Neutral
I think this is going to be one of the huge new drivers of growth,Neutral
"You can see that the cloud is a huge driver of growth for salesforce, mobile is a huge driver of growth for salesforce, and now youâ€™ve got AI as this next generation system",Positive
I just gave you the story about Louis Vuitton,Neutral
Einstein is built into all of those apps,Neutral
"So, Einstein is an incredible advancement and itâ€™s great for all of our clouds",Positive
Let me jump in and then maybe Keith or Mark might want to add on the first one and I will close loop on the second one on the 18% and 19%,Neutral
"You are absolutely right, Karl",Neutral
"The unbilled deferred revenue at 30% is a slight acceleration and a very, very big number in terms of growth",Positive
"We have -- I think itâ€™s really reflective of a strong business that weâ€™ve been describing, that Keith has been describing in his dialogue, a large sort of deals over a long time but just overall health, across geos, [ph] across clouds",Positive
Karlâ€™s absolutely right,Neutral
"And let me just pick up the second point, Karl",Neutral
"And the other thing that I would add and I do think there is one little extra bit of color that I would like to add, Karl, which is look at that trending just as it is and then you take a look at the fact that last year in Q2 2017, we had a seasonally soft Q2 2017 and we had a seasonally strong Q3 2017. And so, you put that and you look at that results delivered at minus 9% quarter-on-quarter and youâ€™ll see it perfectly on the graph but then you put it in juxtaposition to this year in Q3 2018, we have a -- obviously weâ€™re appropriately guided and we had a very strong Q2. So, those are the things to think about as well the bottom line and thatâ€™s where weâ€™re at, thatâ€™s what you should consider",Positive
"First of all, I think you can see this great win with the Veteranâ€™s administration this quarter is an indication of the government vertical is working better than we expected",Positive
"And I think our win with the veterans this quarter, I think all of us know that nobody delivers better systems and better customer service than our veterans, and thatâ€™s why weâ€™re so excited to be able to align with the agency to go to build these next generation systems for them",Neutral
Weâ€™ve had some great early successes with Watson,Positive
And I think itâ€™s one of the reasons we had such a great quarter,Positive
"Well anyway, thank you everyone for a great call",Neutral
"And we couldnâ€™t be more excited, as I said",Neutral
I think this is probably our best quarter ever,Neutral
Itâ€™s far exceeded our expectations,Neutral
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us,Neutral
"Q1 was an excellent start to the year, as we delivered solid double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings",Positive
"In semiconductors, analyst predictions are more positive than in past quarters, reflecting the investments going into the early products in the Internet of Things, machine learning, automotive, augmented and virtual reality, networking infrastructure, and the continually growing need for more compute power in the cloud",Positive
"In fact, the strength of our design, verification and IP platforms positions us well with customers readying themselves for their next wave of growth",Positive
This is precisely where Synopsys excels,Neutral
"Overall, our digital design platform, which is centered around synthesis, place and route, and sign-off, continues to make great strides",Positive
"First, our leading synthesis franchise around Design Compiler, which benefits from an extraordinarily strong and broad usage base, is seeing a rapid succession of technology advances and runtime improvements, including in its ability to deal with advanced test requirements",Positive
"In addition to a continuing drumbeat of technical improvements, the strong correlation between the design and sign-off tools is a massive risk-reducer for our customers while impacting their time to market",Positive
"Now to verification, where our platform vision and technology execution have yielded excellent business and market share growth",Positive
"The product is not only doing well business-wise, but also delivering great new technology advances",Positive
Our hardware-based ZeBu emulation and HAPS prototyping had another strong quarter as well,Positive
"On to our IP products, where we continue to deliver strong results and gain customer recognition",Positive
Our IP group is growing well,Neutral
"While itâ€™s early, we are making great progress: 8 of the top 10 software companies in the world are now Synopsys customers; So are 7 of the top 10 automotive OEMs; And, illustrating the TAM-broadening potential for Synopsys, so are 16 of the top 20 commercial banks in the world",Positive
"Synopsys has a very strong presence in the embedded space, including automotive, medical devices and IoT; Cigital is a leader in serving enterprise customers, with particular strength in financial services",Positive
"Weâ€™re seeing very good momentum with our EDA platforms, continued strength in our IP portfolio, and good growth in Software Integrity as we continue to invest and broaden our TAM in this very promising emerging market",Positive
Let me now turn the call over to Trac,Neutral
"At the same time, Iâ€™ve said many, many times that the growth rate of the semiconductor industry in aggregate over multi-years is really about 4% to 4.5%",Positive
Thatâ€™s all good news for us,Neutral
In many ways you answered your own question,Neutral
And you were right because we have not predicted such a strong Q1; and the fact that Q2 is a strong follow up is only encouraging,Positive
Sure,Neutral
"We are step-by-step broadening the Cigital capability on a world-wide basis, which is a great opportunity, and at the same time making sure that both teams are well educated on the offerings that we have",Positive
I think we are well on track to create something that is stronger again,Positive
Youâ€™re welcome,Neutral
Well,Neutral
"But we are maybe a conservative Company, or fundamentally we try to execute to what we say we will do",Neutral
"Having said that, run rates grew again",Neutral
And so itâ€™s well possible that the second half of the year turns out to be strong,Positive
Well,Neutral
"As you were listing them, I kept thinking about all the other products that are positively impacted too",Neutral
"I think that is why, as much as a lot of people call this the age of internet of things, the internet of things is almost more a catalyst to growth in all of these other dimension than anything else",Neutral
And so that is the mission that we are on,Neutral
Youâ€™re welcome,Neutral
"Well, I think at a macro level, if you look at all of these products taken together, theyâ€™re fundamentally anchored at least to a large portion, not entirely, in the semiconductor industry",Neutral
"Per an earlier question, notwithstanding the year-to-year differences, the semiconductor industry has had a fairly steady growth rate and with steady R&D expenditures, and therefore fairly steady EDA growth all in all",Positive
And then we have predicted that the software side itself would go through this by virtue of the complexity growth,Positive
"And to the earlier question of how does our financial profile evolve, be it in growth and profitability, while weâ€™re managing Synopsys as a portfolio of a number of specialty areas that are very related but somewhat independent in their growth spurts",Positive
"In that context, the Cigital acquisition was great because these are people that are accustomed and knowledgeable about reflecting the broader picture than advocating what is sort of a good approach for the Company to deal with it, while not necessarily pushing for individual products",Positive
"But of course, now highlighting what we have",Neutral
Every thoughts and thatâ€™s more difficult and maybe legal situation is resulting from that,Neutral
Letâ€™s hope this yields the same,Neutral
Your second question was on Custom Compiler,Neutral
So we will continue to watch this space,Neutral
But letâ€™s see what the future brings,Neutral
"Maybe if I can toot our own horn, I think that we are â€“ we have very capable products too, and increasingly a lot of our top customers reflect on the strength of our platforms",Neutral
Youâ€™re welcome,Neutral
Iâ€™m not sure if we understood the question,Neutral
"Well, if youâ€™re referring to the profitability part, obviously these businesses as we grow them, we also have in place a discipline to make them gradually more profitable",Positive
"And the question is always when you have something that grows very fast, is it better from a â€“ both competitive position, growing the value of the Company over time, to push on growth or on profitability",Positive
"And so while the high-growth businesses are less profitable than the lower-growth businesses, in aggregate I think weâ€™re actually in a very good balanced portfolio situation",Positive
Youâ€™re welcome,Neutral
"Well, I guess we have reached the end of the hour",Neutral
We had a very strong quarter and we look forward to Q2 with a fairly high degree of confidence and a strong year as well,Positive
Thank you very much,Neutral
Good afternoon,Neutral
I'm happy to report that our second quarter results were strong,Positive
Trac will discuss the financials in more detail,Neutral
"This, in turn, drives growth opportunities around machine learning, automotive, augmented and virtual reality, networking infrastructure and the soaring need for more cloud-based computation and storage",Positive
Core EDA revenue growth has outpaced competitors over the past years,Positive
IP continues its double digit growth and our software quality and security group is scaling to critical mass with excellent revenue expansion,Positive
"In verification, we continued to see excellent results and a strong outlook for the year",Positive
We continue to see great progress ranging from excellent customer interest in our new superfast VCS simulator to platform-wide adoption and proliferation,Positive
"More broadly, in Q2, we saw strong demand in IP with particular momentum in advanced technology and security",Positive
This as a key differentiator and new TAM for Synopsys and I'm happy to report that it's scaling well both organically and via acquisitions,Positive
Our software sign-off platform is making good progress and we have expanded our road map to reflect the acquisition of Cigital,Positive
We're strong in the embedded space with growing transaction sizes and are gaining good traction in the automotive industry with our security solutions and well-respected expertise,Positive
"And we do this with a clear bottom line objective and many year track record, of driving ongoing high single-digit EPS growth and returning cash to shareholders",Positive
Let me now turn the call over to Trac,Neutral
"Well, in general, I think we're in a phase of the industry around us and ourselves that tends to be strong and when we give you directions on growth rates of the different areas, we always look at it from a perspective of a multi-year outlook because that's sort of the only fair way to do it, all the more given that we have a multi-year agreement",Neutral
"Having said that, there's no question that the push towards more advanced chips is actually continuing strong and I think the reason for that is relatively straightforward which is that the new opportunities in technologies and products are using any of the existing computation and mobility techniques but now amended by increased digital intelligence requirements, will continue to be very strong after that enormous amounts of data generated by a happily growing set of sensors",Positive
So I think we're fortunate to do well,Neutral
So the timing can be somewhat arbitrary,Neutral
There's no question that we have done well in the hardware area and I think that correlate directly to what we said earlier which is growth in complexity of chips but also more and more chips and the affiliated software needing to be verified together,Neutral
And I think that bodes very well for us,Neutral
I have not seen any seasonality,Neutral
"I think it is very much project based and it has always a little bit the characteristic that the minute they figure out what's going to be in the project, they would like to have the IP the next day which, of course, not possible because a lot of this gets developed as part of agreements and service development sets",Neutral
But the projects come and go,Neutral
They are completely ready for the 7-nanometer,Neutral
That will take a little while,Neutral
It doesn't matter that much,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
"Just to clarify, when we do IP, people buy existing functionality but very often wanted to be delivered in a very specific form, maybe with some alterations or with some tuning for their versions of technology",Neutral
But it is a good question,Neutral
It is sort of a balance between the 2.,Neutral
Many have not been successful,Neutral
"And now there is a significant segment of strong Chinese companies that are -- that have, year after year, become closer and closer to be at the state of the art and we would certainly say that there are a few companies that are designing with absolutely state-of-the-art silicon technology",Positive
And so they have been broad users of our tools,Neutral
Definitely yes,Neutral
"And so with the number of companies we have now been working for a while on the development of those, you're absolutely right that, in the last recent period, I would say maybe last 2 years, there has been an increase in attention and effort",Neutral
"And that is the direct response to the fact that most economies are seeing an enormous amount of data coming about, that the big data will be analyzed and therefore, the -- be it in the cloud or be it the devices around it, are all going to use massively more memory and that their strong desire to make that memory a lot faster so that you can do more processing",Positive
Good question,Neutral
It is that they're also very strong in the financial market,Positive
And that is an ongoing effort and going well,Neutral
It is certainly true for software for a long time,Neutral
So all of this is being done,Neutral
But we-re in a very strong position with this and the most advanced customers are very literate about this type of problems,Positive
We have very strong hardware business,Neutral
"If you amend that by the fact that Gartner which tracks many, many security-related companies such as ourselves, are now putting us in the leading quadrant for the activities that we do, obviously, the attention that this is getting is positive for our business even if it's negative for the world and so we-re seeing that with the acquisition of Cigital, with the commentary that Trac just gave you on the existing business",Positive
I think we've navigated well through those,Neutral
"So far, the team has been executing particularly well and if you look at it from the complex chips, our expectations are that we will continue to see good growth and healthy business there",Positive
"Oh, yes, sure, sorry",Neutral
"It is now evolving very, very rapidly",Neutral
We refer to that as hardware,Neutral
"And that growth has just been exemplary because so many people would like to run software on hardware they don't have and so instead, they use an emulator to sort of fake the hardware if you like",Positive
"Hopefully, you took away that we had a very strong quarter, that the outlook for the coming quarter is strong, the overall year is looking extremely solid",Positive
"But most importantly, I think the alignment around our Silicon to Software strategy appears to be working quite well and all the individual businesses have contributed strongly to our present success",Positive
Good afternoon,Neutral
I am happy to report another excellent quarter and with it another outstanding year for Synopsys,Positive
"In fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $2.725 billion, an increase of 12.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.42, 13% growth, we generated $635 million in operating cash flow, our three-year backlog grew by approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion and we bought back $400 million of our stock",Positive
"These results extended our multi-year track record of strong growth with three-year CAGRs of 10% for both revenue and non-GAAP earnings, accentuated by upside from hardware and IP, our business became stronger and stronger as we moved through the year, resulting in good revenue growth across all product groups and all geographies",Positive
"The fiscal â€˜17 double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth was achieved through both revenue growth and increasing operating margin, even with acquisition-related dilution",Positive
"Simultaneously, we further scaled our Software Integrity solutions with good organic growth, the Cigital acquisition in Q1 and the planned Black Duck transaction announced earlier this month",Positive
Trac will discuss the financials in more detail,Neutral
"And third, we have maintained strong financial solidity while broadening our company TAM precisely for the opportunity at hand",Positive
Weâ€™ve managed our strong balance sheet and cash flow to enable both consistent stock buybacks and TAM-broadening acquisitions,Positive
"And weâ€™re driving shareholder value through long-term, high-single digit, non-GAAP earnings growth",Positive
"Synopsys EDA continues to enable astounding levels of complexity, resulting in strong demand for state-of-the-art solutions across our product lines",Positive
"Even with strong competition and continued customer consolidation, weâ€™ve fared well with growth outpacing the others over the past several years",Positive
We continue to strongly invest in our market leading digital design platform,Positive
"And while weâ€™re seeing share gains with customers across industries ranging from networking to storage to sensors, automotive has been particularly strong with nine of the top 10 automotive IC suppliers enabled through the Synopsys platform",Positive
"In custom and analog mixed-signal design, our Custom Compiler and Circuit Simulation not only demonstrated excellent technical results but saw good revenue growth during the year",Positive
"Now to verification, which continues to be an area of strength and growth for Synopsys",Positive
"In fiscal 2017, our investments have resulted in another outstanding year of growth and share gains",Positive
Strong customer adoption of our hardware verification products drove another record year as well,Positive
"Turning to semiconductor IP, we had another excellent year of double-digit growth",Positive
"During the year, we made good progress integrating the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions, and are now seeing a positive impact on demand",Positive
"Because safety is so critical, the automotive industry requires certification of products up and down their value chain",Negative
"Weâ€™ve significantly expanded our portfolio of products certified for standards such as ISO 26262, including our functional safety test solution, which was certified in Q4. During this year, weâ€™ve massively expanded our industry-leading automotive grade IP offering, including a broad portfolio of interface blocks that meet stringent automotive temperature requirements for the 16-nanometer FinFET process",Neutral
"We achieved outstanding financial results, with revenue strength across the Board",Positive
Let me now turn the call over to Trac,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
"Secondly, there is no question that semiconductor has had a very, very strong year",Positive
"And in all fairness, this is after a few years of not being particularly strong and so these things tend to go up and down but up feels better than down, no question about that",Positive
"Well, Trac, can comment on some of the financials normally, we donâ€™t give out specific growth rates on the acquisitions",Positive
"And one of the biggest productivity increases and this is true on chips with IP, I think, it is true on software by virtue of our use of software and Open Source software is, of course, the fact that you can use software for many sources and assemble it quickly",Neutral
"Itâ€™s actually a quite difficult question, because we touch many, many companies that are in the automotive space and we ourselves find it a bit challenging to know exactly what is in the automotive part and what is in the regularly semiconductor deliveries",Negative
We have been growing faster in verification,Neutral
Things ebb and flow and go back and forth,Neutral
"And so, I think, I have nothing negative to say about any of the other companies, we are all striving to be a good providers in a market that right now is doing very well and so weâ€™ve had the benefits of making a number of investments over the years that are paying off particularly well right now",Neutral
Youâ€™re welcome,Neutral
"The third aspect I would mention is that, our IP business has been very strong and that is definitely partially the result of continued investment in the most advanced nodes, which is difficult IP to do",Positive
"And this is a domain that has been extremely fractured in the past, and weâ€™re already starting to get I would say very strong positive feedback from the number of CIOs or people that are responsible for the security of software that being able to interact with a company that has longevity and some mass, gives them a better feeling of security that weâ€™re going to be around",Positive
Youâ€™re welcome,Neutral
"We review this for many years after the acquisition with our Board, always with some up and some down surprises, which is another word of saying, itâ€™s always difficult to exactly predict",Negative
"So, that is the process that we follow",Neutral
Youâ€™re welcome,Neutral
"Well, let me go backwards",Neutral
"Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone",Neutral
"Demonstrating our continued momentum that started late last year, orders were up 11% year-over-year, with the book-to-bill of 1.06. And on an organic basis, orders grew 10%",Positive
"We saw organic orders growth across all three of our segments in quarter one, excluding SubCom",Positive
"We also saw orders growth in all regions with particular strength in Asia, which grew 26% year-over-year, with strength in China",Positive
"Industrial orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and organic orders grew 4%, with growth across each of our three industrial businesses",Positive
"In Communications, excluding SubCom and the sale of our Circuit Protection business last year, we saw year-over-year organic orders growth of 14%, including 7% growth in data and devices as we begin ramping high-speed connectivity that is benefiting from cloud applications as Tom mentioned",Positive
"Our auto sales were up 13% organically in the quarter, well ahead of auto production growth of 5% due to increased content from the secular trends we talked to you about around safe, green and connected, coupled with our very strong global leadership position",Positive
"Note that these incentives are now being faced out over the course of the year, so as we look forward, we expect that vehicle production growth in China will continue to be front-end loaded in the first half of 2017. For the full year, we expect 4% growth in vehicle production in China and 2% growth in auto production globally",Positive
"While this assumption of 2% auto production growth globally is an increase from our prior view of 1%, this sell-side comes from the strength in the first half in China, with our outlook for the second half production being the same as our view 90 days ago",Positive
"For the full year, we expect to continue to outpace the growth of production due to the continued benefit of content growth as well as share gains",Positive
"Turning to Commercial Transportation, our team delivered another very strong quarter against still a tough backdrop",Positive
"This was outperformance versus the market, with organic revenue up 16%, driven by a very strong heavy truck market in China, content growth due to the adoption of new emission standards and regulations as well as share gains",Positive
"In our sensors business, the acquisition last year of Jaquet drove 3% growth overall",Positive
"The business declined slightly on an organic basis, with growth in automotive applications and industrial applications being offset by softness in the North American heavy truck applications",Negative
We are expecting organic growth for the year in sensors and continue to expect a further growth inflection as we go into 2018 as further auto applications ramp the volume,Positive
"For the segment, adjusted operating margins of 22% were up 340 basis points year-over-year, with strong flow-through on a double-digit organic sales and increase of productivity improvements",Positive
"When you think about the segment margin, our margin expectations remained the same for the segment and you should continue to think of steady state transportation operating margins as 20% plus or minus to 1. Please turn to Slide 6, so I can discuss our Industrial Solutions segment, which performed in line on both the top line and on the margin side in quarter one",Neutral
"Industrial solutions sales grew 12% on a reported basis, driven by the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and generated 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, despite the 80 basis points of headwind from the declines in oil and gas",Negative
"If we had owned Creganna and Intercontec in the year ago period, our growth for this business would grow up at 16% year-over-year, demonstrating strong performance of these acquired businesses",Positive
"Industrial Equipment, we grew 1% organically, driven by strengthening market around the factory automation area as well as growth in medical",Positive
"Aerospace and defense remained strong with 4% organic growth, driven by increased content on new airframe builds as well as momentum in defense programs",Positive
"Our energy business declined 3% organically, with growth in North America and Asia more than offset by the softness in Europe",Negative
D&D has returned to organic growth following 3 years of decline from product exits as we refocused the portfolio within the business,Negative
Organic growth is occurring six months sooner than we expected in the business,Positive
I would also like to highlight that we also have a very strong quarter growth in our appliances business and we saw continued operational improvements throughout the segment that I will talk more about in a little bit,Positive
"Organically, sales were up 3%, with reported segment sales down 4% year-over-year, due primarily to the sale of the Circuit Protection business in March of last year",Negative
"Our appliance business has very strong quarter growth, with 14% organic growth year-over-year, driven by China market growth, share gains and strength in North America",Positive
The growth in D&D is the result of new ramps at cloud customers and a completion of our multi-year journey to refocus the product portfolio in key growth applications,Positive
D&D grew 2% organically in the quarter and now we expect organic growth for the full fiscal year,Positive
"In addition to the growth that we are excited about, data and devices also doubled its top earning adjusted margin from a year ago and we expect this business to be an increasing contributor to the profitability of the Communications segment going forward",Positive
Our momentum continues through this growth cycle and we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 5% in fiscal 2017 based upon our very strong backlog,Positive
"For the Communications segment, adjusted operating margins were 13.2% for the quarter, down 70 basis points year-over-year",Negative
"If you would normalize for this impact, Communicationsâ€™ adjusted operating margins expanded significantly in the first quarter of â€˜17. And to really illustrate the progress that we have made in this segment over the past four quarters, adjusted operating margins have expanded from approximately 8% in the second quarter of last year to 13% in the quarter we just completed",Positive
And we are proud of that accomplishment,Neutral
"Thanks, Heath",Neutral
"We expect second quarter revenue of $3.025 billion to $3.125 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.09, representing sales growth of 4% on both the recorded and on an organic basis and 19% EPS growth at the midpoint",Positive
"This guidance does include the impact of a stronger dollar, which we expect to be a $60 million headwind to sales and a $0.03 headwind to EPS on a year-over-year basis",Positive
"Following two consecutive quarters of record adjusted earnings per share and strong orders in the first quarter, we expect our second quarter adjusted EPS to also be a quarterly record and our guidance represents a strong first half of fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid single-digits organically and low single-digits on a recorded basis due to the impact of the dollar",Positive
"This is above expected auto production growth levels of 2% in the second quarter, where exact growth will be driven by Asia and in Europe",Positive
Commercial transportation growth is expected to be driven by China,Positive
"And in communications, we expect mid single-digit organic growth, with growth in all three of our businesses",Positive
"Relative to our prior view 90 days ago, we are raising our organic growth expectations for 2017 by 100 basis points and raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, with better operational performance more than offsetting the headwinds from the strengthening dollar that Heath highlighted",Positive
"While we are raising our guidance for the full year, we are maintaining our previous view of the second half by keeping our second half organic growth expectations consistent with our view, 90 days ago",Positive
"And when you look at the implied trends for first half to second half, please keep in mind the impact of the stronger dollar and the tax dynamics that Heath mentioned earlier and we have some slide details in the back of slide material for your reference",Positive
"This represents 3% reported growth, 4% organic growth on the top line and 11% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks of fiscal 2016. Relative to our prior view of revenue guidance, reported revenue growth is down 200 basis points due to the $300 million impact from the currency exchange rates",Positive
"Our organic growth is up 100 basis points, reflecting improvement in the transportation and communication segments",Positive
Then this is offset by $0.16 of headwind from the stronger dollar,Positive
"So really, highlighting the strong business model Heath and Tom talked about",Positive
"I do feel very good about our ability to drive 4% organic growth, expand the operating margins by 50 to 70 basis points and generate double-digit adjusted EPS growth in this uncertain macro environment",Neutral
"This is an improvement and demonstrates as the portfolio is delivering, while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our businesses",Positive
"While much of our operating margin expansion in the past few years have been driven by our transportation segment, I am pleased that in 2017 our operating margin expansion will be driven by all three segments, with more contribution from communications and industrial",Positive
"So before the full year guidance and thinking through the segments, we expect transportation solutions to be up mid single-digits organically, on 2% auto production growth reflecting content growth trends and share gains",Neutral
"Industrial Solutionsâ€™ organic growth guidance is not changing from 90 days ago and we continue to expect growth to be up low single-digits organically, with continued gains in commercial aerospace and defense as well as medical",Positive
Progress and growth and profitability is ahead of our prior expectations,Positive
We now expect organic growth for D&D in fiscal 2017 in the low single-digits and momentum in SubCom remains strong,Positive
And we continue to expect growth in the mid single-digits for the year in SubCom,Positive
"Wamsi, let me take that",Neutral
"When you look at it, the first quarter what was a very strong quarter and it was driven at Asia",Positive
"We saw I think, continued trends around sort of North America being flat, but we also did have growth in Europe",Neutral
"It is not one application and I think really when it comes to the perfect content and the share gains, it represents our strong global position that we have throughout automotive",Positive
"I think when you look at the year, like I said in the guidance, we did expect automotive in the second half of the year production to slowdown versus the first half",Neutral
We kept that the same,Neutral
"We still feel when you get to the second half, while production globally, we assume to be relatively flat",Neutral
"We are going to still drive mid single-digit organic growth, improve that organic content and growth story",Positive
"So itâ€™s just one of the elements of how production is with the strong Asia part in the first half, a lot of it is driven by China",Positive
"Hey Wamsi, itâ€™s Terrence again",Neutral
I think the order trends for some of the comments we made show very strong trends that we are excited about,Positive
And then also the element around D&D growth,Positive
Thatâ€™s not a headwind thereafter,Neutral
We did a lot of pruning to get that business focused on applications where we thought we could get paid for the great engineering and serve our customers for that we do,Positive
"Absolutely, certainly when you think about integrated products and where we bring [ph] sort of giving much more than just an interconnect product, but other technologies like sensors and sometimes even some of our cable technology on the material side, it does go broader than transmission",Neutral
It is then track applications,Neutral
"But Craig, I think the important point is, when you see the content growth that we are driving above production like we did in the first quarter and what we guided for the year in auto, it shows integrated solutions that help drive that content up",Neutral
"Sure my comment was 20% Amit, plus or minus 1%",Neutral
So I appreciate you being aggressive,Neutral
"Well and on the sensors, sensors actually â€“ we all know that, thatâ€™s running single-digit as we continue to invest ahead of the range that we have ahead of us that will begin in 2018. So we do think that, that will be a lever over time as those programs ramp, but we saw a significant investment in those programs",Neutral
"So as we talk to you, we do think that app will get up to mid-teens EBITDA over time, but we are going to make investments and plan to ramp this programs and we are from a margin perspective, investing ahead",Neutral
"So I do think thatâ€™s something that we will have a little bit more of detail on it, but it will help the transportation margins over time",Neutral
"Sure, Jim",Neutral
Let me take both of those,Neutral
So letâ€™s start with oil and gas,Neutral
"And that stabilization, we are happy to see certainly we hope upside comps as oil moves, but right now, I would say as we see it from the programs we are exposed to is much more around stabilization than I would say any ramp up",Positive
"So pipelines, land-based, we are not strong in that",Positive
But thatâ€™s not assumed right now,Neutral
"So we still think we are in a growth phase, but I would just say, right now, the 5% that we talked about last quarter being up year-over-year, even though we were down a little bit due to timing in the first quarter, we feel right in front of us and itâ€™s really around execution for us this year",Neutral
Sure,Neutral
"Well, a couple of different angles there",Neutral
Intercontec has been a great performance out of the gate,Positive
"And so looking at things along that, maybe not the same size necessarily of ground type transaction, those things are a little bit closer to the Intercontec size or something, plus or minus in that range that have good margins and where we can get to a return on invested capital may be a little quicker than historically we have, so lots of opportunity out there, but we will be choosy and spend the shareholdersâ€™ dollar wisely",Neutral
"A couple of things, well, thanks for the question",Neutral
"Overall, we expect growth to be mid single-digit",Positive
"So as there was the industrial recession going on that impacted our Industrial segment, it did also impact the Measurement asset, then the growth was a little bit slower",Positive
"What we really get excited about was when we bought Measurement, we basically signed up to scale that and use our go-to-market and take that great Measurement technology into different markets like automotive and to places like industrial transportation",Positive
"And really, those program wins and that momentum there is very strong, that program pipeline is strong",Positive
"And really you are going to see the growth of that, really in 2018 as when we are going to start having some of our launches",Positive
"So whatâ€™s really great about the programs we have won is they are among varying technologies, they are at different regions of the world, which really shows the strength of our go-to-market and then it also comes out some of that business case that when we bought Measurement to get these technologies, how do we leverage our go-to-market in places where we have very exceptional leadership positions like our Transportation segment, we are leveraging",Positive
"We do expect production to still stay strong into the second quarter, but there is still is an element of when you have incentives, this is pull forward demand",Positive
"And so when we look at it and talking to our customers, they have told us things back to production to moderate in the second half versus a very strong level we are going to have in the first quarter and continue a little bit in the second quarter",Positive
And we are really aligned with our customers,Neutral
"But we expect organic growth in our automotive business, even in a flat environment due to our content and share gains",Positive
"So when you look at that year-on-year, we do expect growth in transportation in a flat backdrop production months right now",Positive
"When you get into any integration and one of the things thatâ€™s great about the business that we have always had is we benefit from electronics trends, but we also get integrated out due to electronic trends",Positive
And that drives the content growth opportunity and the stickiness we have with our customers and our engineers basically create so much more opportunities,Positive
So we knew thatâ€™s a net-net opportunity,Neutral
So itâ€™s all plus,Neutral
I'm very excited to share our strong results for the third quarter and our increased growth and earnings outlook we're providing for the full year,Positive
"To briefly recap the key elements of our strategy that we've been driving, number one it's about driving above market growth through our focus on harsh environment applications, where we can accelerate content growth",Positive
"This represents 8% organic growth year-over-year with growth across all our segments, as well as regions",Positive
This year's growth in EPS year-over-year was entirely driven by our sales and operating income performance,Positive
If you want to look at our $1.24 compared to our guidance of $1.16 approximately half was driven by the higher sales growth of 8% with the remainder driven by taxes and a little bit of currency,Positive
This represents 7% organic revenue growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth versus the prior year,Positive
"With this, we firmly believe that TE is firing on all cylinders with all segments contributing to both revenue growth and margin expansion this year",Positive
"As I think about this year and to put it in perspective, back when we gave guidance in November, we assumed 3% organic growth and $4.34 adjusted earnings per share compared to the $3.95 we did in 2016 on a 52-week basis",Neutral
"The increase since the start of the year reflects strong organic growth across all segments and operational improvements across our businesses that now results in the 7% organic growth and 20% adjusted earnings per share growth, driven almost entirely by our strong operational performance",Positive
The broad-based growth ahead of the markets we serve continues to reinforce our strategic progress on content growth and having the right products to the right markets,Positive
"If you look at our new guidance for the year compared to last quarter, the 7% organic growth outlook is an improvement of 100 basis points, and we're raising our earnings per share guidance by $0.11. I'd appreciate if you could turn to slide 3 and let me review some of additional highlights from the third quarter",Positive
"Not only do we have growth across all segments and regions, but each of our segments delivered growth ahead of our expectations in the quarter",Positive
"We delivered 8% organic growth in Transportation, with growth across automotive, commercial transportation and sensors",Positive
"In Industrial Solutions, organic growth of 5% was driven by strength in factory automation and medical applications",Positive
"And in the Communications Solutions segment, sales increased 14% organically with growth across each of our three business units, demonstrating the progress we have made in transforming this segment to be a contributor to overall TE performance",Positive
"Also during the quarter, we had strong free cash flow of over $400 million that we generated, and we returned $324 million back to our owners, and we also announced bolt-on acquisitions in the automotive and medical markets that will expand our portfolio and ability to provide integrated highly engineered solutions in these growing markets",Positive
Let me get into the order trends,Neutral
I appreciate if you could turn to slide 4. We continue to see broad based strength in orders across our segments as well as balanced order growth across regions which reinforces expectations for a higher growth versus our prior view,Positive
"Total orders which exclude SubCom were $3.3 billion during the quarter, and this is up 12% year-over-year on both a reported and an organic basis",Neutral
"Organically excluding SubCom, our orders grew evenly with the Americas, Asia and Europe each growing low double digits in the quarter",Positive
"And if you reflect back at the start of the year when we guided in our first quarter, orders and revenue growth were heavily weighted towards Asia and were encouraged by the balance we are now seeing as Europe and United States continue to strengthen",Positive
"In Transportation, orders increased 15% organically with growth in all regions and particular strength in Europe and Asia",Positive
"Industrial orders grew 6% organically year-over-year, with growth in all regions and particular strength in Asia",Positive
"And in Communications excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic order growth of 12%, including 7% growth in data and devices from high-speed connectivity ramping in cloud and data center applications, while appliance orders grew 17% year-over-year",Positive
"One thing I'd like to highlight that while on a year-over-year basis, orders increased double digits in the third quarter, the guidance that we gave for the fourth quarter reflects mid-single-digit revenue growth",Positive
"The third quarter was another very strong quarter for our Transportation segment, which continued to show our content growth momentum",Positive
"sales grew 8% organically year-over-year, and operating margins were in line with our expectations",Positive
"Segment sales exceeded expectations due to strong auto demand across regions and our leading position in the heavy truck market, along with strong sensors growth which was 7% organically",Positive
"In auto, our sales were up 6% organically with mid-single-digit growth rate in the Americas, Europe and Asia against a global auto production growth of only 1%",Positive
We continue to consistently demonstrate the ability to outperform the market due to content growth and expect that trend to continue even at these lower production levels,Positive
"For the full year of 2017, we expect high-single-digit organic growth in auto on approximately 3% production growth, but clearly that 3% production growth was driven by the stronger production growth in the first half that we talked about in prior calls",Positive
"Turning to commercial transportation, our business continues to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 23% year-over-year",Positive
"Growth is driven by continued strength in the global heavy-duty truck market, particularly in China, and while we do expect China growth will moderate over time, we are encouraged to see signs of continued growth in Europe and North America as these markets improve",Positive
"In sensors, during the quarter, our business grew 7% organically year-over-year with growth driven by Transportation as well as an improving industrial backdrop, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year in our sensors business",Positive
"Additionally, we're also encouraged by the strong design win momentum that we had in sensors that was reflected by double-digit order growth year-over-year in the quarter",Positive
"Adjusted operating margin were as expected at approximately 19% in the quarter in the segment, but I would say, at these year-over-year revenue growth levels, we would normally expect a corresponding expansion of margins versus where we guided",Positive
"This is a temporary issue as our teams are fully engaged to ensure our customers are not impacted by these supply dynamics, and we expect this to be fully remedied in early fiscal 2018. So let's talk about the Industrial Solutions segment, so I'd appreciate if you could turn to slide 6. Growth momentum in the Industrial Solutions segment continued with 5% organic growth year-over-year in the quarter",Negative
"Now, this growth we saw in the industrial equipment side is really due to our position in the factory automation and medical markets, also coupled with the acquisitions that we completed last year, and this is really driving the strong growth ahead of the market on both a reported and on an organic basis",Positive
"When you think about Intercontec and Creganna, both of these acquisitions performing exceptionally well and ahead of our expectations",Neutral
"In aerospace, defense and marine, we did see a slight organic decline in the quarter in revenue, and this was driven entirely by program timing in commercial aerospace, and that was partially offset by growth in defense",Negative
"Our energy business in the quarter grew 2% organically, and that was driven by growth in Europe and Asia",Positive
"On the margin side, our adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 12.7%, and this was flat sequentially and down year-over-year due to the near term softness in commercial aerospace, which does run above segment average margins",Negative
"We do expect Industrial segment margins to resume expansion in our fourth quarter, and this will be both on a sequential and year-over-year basis, driven by a combination of both growth and cost actions",Positive
The Communications segment delivered another outstanding quarter with 14% organic growth and 500 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 16%,Positive
Starting with data and devices,Neutral
Data and devices had 6% organic growth as we continued to benefit from high-speed ramps in cloud infrastructure customers,Positive
"In appliances, we had another solid quarter with 14% organic growth year-over-year as demand remained strong particularly in Asia",Positive
"And in SubCom, growth was 22% organically in the quarter reflecting the strong growth cycle of this business",Positive
"Earlier this month, we announced the winning of a new regional program which provides high-speed bandwidth between the Caribbean and the United States, and we continue to expect high-single-digit growth for the SubCom business in 2017. Now, with that as a backdrop, I'll hand it over to Heath who'll get into the financials in more detail",Positive
"For the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter revenue at $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.16. When you look at this, this represents reported sales growth of 5% and organic sales growth of 4%",Positive
"And from an operational perspective, this would be adjusted EPS growth of 8% once you normalize with the unusually low tax rate we had last year that Heath just highlighted",Positive
Looking at it by segment,Neutral
This is above expected auto production levels of 1% with the outperformance driven by the content growth I mentioned earlier,Positive
"We also expect growth in commercial transportation across all regions in the fourth quarter, and as noted earlier, we do expect to have some lingering effects on margins from supply chain dynamics in the fourth quarter",Positive
"But expect margin performance to improve as we put these issues behind us in early 2018. In Industrial Solutions, we expect to grow high single digits on a reported basis and mid-single digits organically, with growth expected across all three of our business units",Positive
"And in Communications, we expect also mid-single-digit growth on both the reported and organic basis with growth in each of our three businesses",Positive
"And while demand continues to be strong, we historically see seasonal declines in the mid-single-digit range from quarter four into our first quarter",Positive
"I'd also ask as you think about adjusted operating margins, please keep in mind that we're currently running in the mid-16% range, and that the first quarter 2017 had an unusually high operating margin level that we covered in detail back in the first quarter call",Positive
We are raising the midpoint of our guidance to represent 7% organic revenue growth and 20% adjusted earnings per share growth for 2017. We expect revenue in the range of $12.85 billion to $12.95 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.72 to $4.74. I'm very proud that our 20% EPS growth is driven almost entirely by strong organic growth performance and operating income expansion that we have in 2017. We did also benefit from using our strong cash flow model both via adding on bolt-on M&A and returning capital to our owners,Positive
"When you think about the growth in the margin and the EPS by segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to be up high-single digits organically on approximately 3% global auto production growth this year, reflecting continued content growth and share gains",Neutral
"In Industrial Solutions for the year, organic growth guidance of low-single digits is consistent with the guidance we've been giving since the start of the year, reflecting continued improvement in industrial markets",Positive
"And in Communications, we expect it to be up high-single digits organically, a further improvement versus our prior view, reflecting continued strength in our appliances and growth in data and devices",Positive
"In summary, I feel very good about our portfolio and execution and believe we are well-positioned to deliver growth ahead of our markets",Neutral
"As Heath mentioned, we've established levers to drive earnings growth and continue to perform well against our business model, and this year's results represent best-in-class performance with 7% organic growth, expanded operating margins and 20% adjusted EPS growth that these results truly demonstrate the execution along all the levers we have in our business model",Positive
"Lastly, before I go to Q&A, I want to close by thanking our employees all around the world for their continued strong execution and commitment to our customers",Positive
"Thank you, Wamsi, for the question",Neutral
And I think one of the things that we're very fortunate about where we drive growth it's just not in one region in the world it's across the world,Neutral
"And even as production has slowed down to 1% and pretty much in line with where we are, it does come back to how do we drive across the three big trends that are happening in the vehicle",Negative
"And we've continuously shown content growth, and it has been accelerating both from our focus as you think about not only what's happening in the connected car or in safety applications, but also benefiting from everything that happens around the powertrain whether it's on combustion engine that needs to get more fuel efficient towards the adoption of electric vehicles that while we talk electric vehicles and you really think about it, we get very excited around where electric vehicles are going in China",Neutral
And I just think we continue to demonstrate it and we feel very good about the program ramps will continue to allow us to have that type of separation even as global production stays at a low-single-digit to flat environment that we're in,Neutral
"Thank you, Wamsi",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
So let me talk about EV,Neutral
"So that's the excitement we have around the content growth, and that comes into the emissions",Positive
"So we think we're very well-positioned, we think we're positioned globally in all regions of the world around the players in that market and it is part of our content growth story of how we position ourselves and it's investments we've been making",Neutral
"So it's why when we look at our double-digit order growth, our guidance is more mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter because we see orders placed out to the far first fiscal quarter and into second fiscal quarter",Positive
I don't see them being cancelled,Neutral
"There are some pockets, like Heath talked about on his automotive question, as well as some of our businesses where you see 14% and 20% growth",Positive
"I think it's pretty pure actually, Amit",Neutral
"So when you sit there, I think it's pretty pure",Neutral
"Things getting extended, I would not say",Neutral
"But in auto itself, I would say, when you look at the growth we've had, it doesn't pull in meaningfully or push out meaningfully because that's why we've had the extra cost",Positive
"Sure, Craig",Neutral
"So North America while we live in every day as Americans, it is the minor part of production when you think about it globally",Neutral
"Our automotive business in North America, and we look at this year, like I said, we have about mid-single-digit growth here in the quarter",Positive
"So, it's only about 6%",Neutral
"And even as you said North America automotive production went down 5%, and we decline with it, it would be $40 million of revenue and a couple of pennies",Negative
"So, I think about it, I think it gets a little bit too much press when you think about TE versus our great global position we have in automotive",Positive
"So what's really great is across the whole product set, which is what we were excited about, and it's also across all regions of the world",Positive
It's not concentrated,Neutral
So I think it does show the momentum that we really have strength in the automotive with our great sales team and go-to market resources,Positive
"From the momentum, it hasn't really changed",Neutral
We are industrializing some of the programs,Neutral
So really good momentum,Neutral
"Hey, Joe",Neutral
Thanks for the question,Neutral
It's Terrence,Neutral
And great question,Neutral
So that's always a plus and I feel very good how our team been executing organic wins with those important customers,Neutral
"Matt, you're exactly right",Neutral
So I think that's the right way,Neutral
It's just the latter part is how you asked it,Neutral
"So, we don't see creep up there",Neutral
"And I would just say when we look at those markets from a direct customer where we service the larger customers direct, it does feel like it's demand",Neutral
"I think when you take the bigger picture, and I think about next year, number one is the content growth story we have in automotive, I think, is very evident of the traction we have",Neutral
"And I think it's fair to assume that automotives, being in this flat to plus 1% production environment where we are right now, would continue into next year",Neutral
"And certainly, medical",Neutral
And the Communications area,Neutral
So I think that's the way I would probably think about the growth going into next year just sitting here today,Neutral
Thanks Jim,Neutral
"So when you look at the big growth, it's really the culmination of the cost actions as well as the focus of the portfolio that we did in that segment mainly around D&D",Positive
"Secondarily, we also did get benefit",Neutral
SubCom had a very strong organic growth of 22%,Positive
So that's also contributing to the increase,Neutral
"I think longer term you should think about the segment margins staying around mid teens, depending upon where the businesses are, but that's where I think you can think about it, but a lot of that margin improvement was structural impact that we've been driving over the past three years that we've talked to you all about",Neutral
No,Neutral
"Well, just to make sure what I said maybe I wasn't clear, when we look at that, it's just our orders have been placed on us because people are worried about the extended supply chain, and we were impacted by that",Neutral
I don't see anything impacting,Neutral
It's just our orders were higher,Neutral
"On the items that Heath talked about, maybe around Transportation, it's not related to passives",Neutral
"So, hopefully that clarifies it",Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
Sure,Neutral
"China auto as we spoke early in the year was extremely strong back in that first quarter as the incentives were benefiting, and you saw it in the registrations",Positive
"It was a little stronger in the first half, but as it worked down post the incentive, it's been in line with what we have expected",Positive
So it doesn't feel like there's a hangover of where production is,Neutral
"And so, when we look forward, clearly, we'll have a compare that we'll have to deal with them in the first quarter, but we see the content story being very strong, and I think China will continue to have production growth",Positive
Okay,Neutral
"Hi, Sherri",Neutral
Thank you for the question,Neutral
First on Subsea and then I'll let Heath do taxes,Neutral
It is a very strong business model from an ROIC no matter where you are,Positive
"I do think it would be slightly dilutive to the Communication margins in the lower part of the cycle, but clearly not as dilutive if you were much lower like it has been in other parts of the cycle",Neutral
"Clearly, and always margin comes into which are the projects we have going, which projects we want, but I think when you think of it from a volume basis, clearly it won't be as dilutive as it was before",Neutral
"And Heath, I'll let you talk about taxes",Neutral
"Thanks, Sherri",Neutral
com/ir,Neutral
A replay will be available through the Web,Neutral
Weâ€™ve all benefitted and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI's shares get a good return on their investment,Positive
I will say he has an outstanding successor,Neutral
"revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year-ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market",Positive
"In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago",Positive
"We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term",Positive
"Turning to our segments, Analog revenue grew 10% from the year ago quarter",Positive
High-volume Analog in logic was about even,Neutral
Connectivity also grew,Neutral
"In our other segment, revenues declined 9% from a year ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products",Negative
"Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TIâ€™s revenue for the year",Positive
"To align by product categories, our customers think about",Neutral
Nothing changes at the segment level,Neutral
"Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points",Neutral
"With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin",Neutral
"Thank you, Kevin",Neutral
Kevin,Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
And weâ€™ll go to the next caller please,Neutral
You could kind of see that inside of our Analog,Neutral
"And with the dividend model that we announced last quarter, it provides a more reverse framework to adjust allocation between -- of that return between dividend growth and share repurchases",Positive
You have follow on to that?,Neutral
"And as we talked about before when you look at the history, it had decline more or like in the mid-teens and that was primarily as the legacy wireless products had on loaned",Negative
"There is seasonality inside of the other business it's driven primarily by calculators, they have a very strong seasonality due to back to school and then we also have royalties inside there that can choppy every once in a while",Positive
"It's more like the mid-single digit, so a growth for the Europe, for industrial '16 over '15, and it good to see, good solid growth there",Positive
"When we look the down into the details of the 14 sectors, we actually did see growth in most of those sectors 14 year",Positive
So again it's kind of same comments and hit on the automotive we are just encouraged that our investments are really turning to that broad based growth,Positive
Do you have a follow-on Ambrish?,Neutral
"Yes, so we are careful try to give guidance on below the top line in any sector, but I think your instincts that will have easy compare because of the weakness we saw a year ago will probably be correct",Neutral
We have got time for one last call please,Neutral
"Yes, there is a -- we are seeing that really broad based growth across regions, across products and across those 14 sectors that we have got in it",Positive
"So, we're real pleased with that growth",Positive
And thank you all for joining us,Neutral
A replay of this call is available on our website,Neutral
"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone",Neutral
Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth,Positive
Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago,Neutral
"As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners",Positive
"Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12-month free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth",Positive
entities owning about 80% of our cash,Neutral
com/ir,Neutral
"With that, let me turn it back to Dave",Neutral
"Thanks, Harlan",Neutral
Yes,Neutral
Thanks for the call,Neutral
I'll handle that one,Neutral
"On OpEx, everything came in about as expected",Neutral
"What I would tell you, the way you want to think about OpEx, high level, we've talked about our model where we want to run OpEx between 20% and 30% of revenue and in stable markets at the lower end of that, the lower half",Neutral
"So you may have some of that played in kind of similar to what happened last year, maybe a little less than that",Neutral
But we're comfortable with our inventory days,Neutral
It's well within our range,Neutral
"Always remember inventory days is a backwards looking metric, so what we have it there for is to support growth",Positive
So it makes sense from a longer-term standpoint to have that inventory available to support revenue growth,Positive
"Yes, I'd be happy to comment",Neutral
The update is no change,Neutral
"Yes, sure",Neutral
"As you think of the company on a go forward basis, the biggest driver of our gross margin is revenue, revenue growth",Neutral
Those are the best opportunities that we have ahead of us because of the constant growth of semiconductors in those spaces,Positive
"Now, beyond revenue growth, then we have 300-millimeter manufacturing, the efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300 millimeter",Positive
And that's because this is an asymmetrical bet,Neutral
This capacity we can buy,Neutral
"When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall through that we get to free cash flow",Positive
"That's where we have been biasing our investments for a number of years, and that's why we're getting strong results in both of those end markets",Positive
"I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investments, investments in sales, in the sales force, in ti",Neutral
"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone",Neutral
Our focused investment on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth,Positive
"As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term, and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners",Positive
"Our balance sheet remains strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S",Positive
entities,Neutral
Turning to our outlook,Neutral
"With that, let me turn it back to Dave",Neutral
"On free cash flow, it grew 4% on a trailing 12-month basis, and that is compared to a higher number for revenue on the same basis",Positive
"Yes, I'll take that",Neutral
"For OpEx, we think of that in terms of, from a model standpoint, we think of it as a percent of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, and for the last couple years, we've actually been running at about 23%",Neutral
"Of course to us, OpEx are investments, and obviously that goes for R&D, but even inside of G&A we think of a large portion there as investment",Neutral
where semiconductor growth is happening,Positive
I wanted just to clarify that,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
"Book-to-bill was, it was 1.0.",Neutral
"Well, it came in about as expected",Neutral
So I wouldn't characterize it as a bit light,Neutral
I think in the last couple years it's been at 23%,Neutral
So you should think about it that way,Neutral
"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance,Neutral
"Thanks, Sterling",Neutral
"In short, we saw increased demand from the U.S",Neutral
That hasn't changed too much over the years,Neutral
That's still very consistent,Neutral
"You are correct, Sterling",Neutral
That marketing spend was down sequentially,Neutral
"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone",Neutral
and 40% was from foreign customers,Neutral
I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance,Neutral
"As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million, as compared to $99 million in the same quarter a year ago and $101 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $130 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124 million shares",Neutral
"market, and that strength in the U.S",Neutral
continued into the second quarter,Neutral
"Well, we provided our guidance for our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year just now, but as far as how expenses flow, what we've outlined in our 10-Q is we do expense our sales and marketing expenses to be higher in the second half of the year, but we'll continue to manage all the expenses of the business, and we expect to be within the non-GAAP operating margin of between 64.5% to 64.25% just given earlier",Neutral
"But I think if you continue to call those out, any expense you could almost view as non-recurring",Neutral
"And so again, I'd look back at the big picture",Neutral
So we'll continue to try to do that,Neutral
"Thank you, Jim",Neutral
I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance,Neutral
"Thank you, Hikmet",Neutral

"outbound, particularly to Latin American countries, continue to be a strong grower",Positive
"to Mexico business increased, although growth trends were not as good as the very strong results we delivered in the fourth quarter",Positive

"revenues were also impacted by a decline in sales of hedging products, partially due to lower FX volatility in some markets",Negative
"Geographically, good growth in Europe was offset by declines in North America and Asia-Pacific",Negative
"The adjusted margin decline was driven by the impact of foreign exchange and customer and funding mix in C2B, partially offset by benefits from timing of marketing spend",Negative
"Foreign exchange hedges in the quarter had a positive impact of $7 million, down from a benefit of $15 million in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect approximately $25 million in hedge benefits for the full year compared to $48 million of benefit in 2016. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $15 million in the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year",Positive
The decline was due to the same factors that affected our operating margin,Negative
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.1%,Neutral
"Excluding these expenses, adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 compares to $0.37 in the first quarter of last year with the decline primarily driven by the higher tax rate",Negative

"The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 13.7%, which compare to 15.1% in the first quarter of 2016 with the decline primarily caused by higher technology expense",Negative
We expect GAAP revenue to be flat to down low-single digits with constant currency revenue increasing in the low-single digits,Negative
"Quarterly, we anticipate rates closer to our full year outlook in the second and third quarters, and then a very low tax rate in Q4. We continue to expect full year GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.48 to $1.60 and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the WU Way-related expenses, in the range of $1.63 to $1.75. Both earnings per share ranges reflect an approximately $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange",Neutral
"Operator, we're now ready to take questions",Neutral
Question-and-Answer Session,Neutral
So that will also pick up,Neutral
"So, it ends up being more expensive for us",Neutral
"And although margins were down from the first quarter of last year, we actually did improve quite a bit from the fourth quarter where we were in the C2B business",Negative
"So, the goal there has been to get really good top-line growth, and we're getting a lot of success there, we're adding to the portfolio",Positive
And then that gives us an opportunity to stabilize margins and maybe improve them over time,Neutral
"Hi, Darrin",Neutral
And the great thing about India is that we have fantastic retail coverage,Positive
And we also have fantastic account coverage,Neutral
We pay out into most accounts in India,Neutral
the infrastructure is right to improve there,Neutral

That's not an acceptable growth level for us,Positive
And we're doing a number of good things in that business where we want to drive better growth,Positive
Our objective is to grow better than that,Neutral
"And what we saw in the quarter, we also had good reported growth in that business of 8%, and that's because Argentina didn't devalue as much as we had expected",Positive
But we continue to see really good growth opportunities for that business,Positive
And then that's being offset a little bit by U.S,Neutral
"So, the growth profile of that business continues to be very strong, and we continue to add to the portfolio",Positive
"So, we had to make some changes",Neutral
We have some performance issue,Neutral
It's all about mix,Neutral
"We do have corridors, which is zero FX",Neutral
We do have corridors where there's both are that,Neutral
I believe there is room,Neutral
"And as I mentioned earlier, our prices are higher than the competition, but the market and the customer feel comfortable with the prices",Neutral
And the 2% constant currency growth is definitely something that are also transaction growth reflects that,Positive
So that's why you see a higher level of cash,Neutral

"So, if we were to get comprehensive tax reform, that could potentially alleviate any future issues of repatriation of foreign profit, which should be a good thing for us",Positive
It's a great product,Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"And in the first quarter this year, we're at 3.7%",Neutral
So it's not a dramatic difference,Neutral
Sure,Neutral
"I think, it has been obviously a great growth rate, and we believe that we are absolutely growing faster than the competition, and the team is executing very well",Positive
And so that's something the team is focused,Neutral

"Hi, Tien-Tsin, this is Raj",Neutral
We are guiding to approximately 20%,Neutral
As you've seen,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
"And it really just depends on where we're getting the growth and obviously the growth is coming from lower RPT corridors and lower growth in higher RPT corridors and if you look at last year it was about the same and then, in 2015 it was flattish in terms of overall mix impact",Positive
"And the World Bank data, they adjusted their principal growth for last year and our principal growth was in line with what the World Bank showed and then for this year, they expect something just under 4% principal growth",Positive
Yeah,Neutral
"We didn't call it out specifically this quarter, but we're continuing to see good performance from both the absolute commission rates that we're seeing in the business as well as the mix benefits from just faster growth of our digital business that's continued to drive overall commission rates down, if you will so, that trend is continuing",Positive
"Thanks, Darrin",Neutral
Some of it is just timing more than anything else,Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
"So some of that is continuing, but overall I would just say the Latin America business is getting healthy growth across the board",Positive
"Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the conditions are quite strong there",Positive
We've seen stronger growth throughout that region more than we've seen in some time,Positive
So it really is more timing than anything else,Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
We don't believe that's really impacting us much,Neutral
So we feel very good about our positioning,Neutral
"If you look at our nation-wide pricing, it's pretty competitive to the other offerings and distribution is very strong as well",Positive
And again dotcom continues to grow really well from a DMT standpoint and we saw some accelerated growth there,Positive
So we're well-positioned competitively,Neutral
It's just timing,Neutral
"One is, U.S",Neutral
outbound and U.S,Neutral
outbound continued to grow really well,Neutral
We saw strong trends similar to what we saw in the prior quarter and that's the largest piece,Positive
The U.S,Neutral
And then the U.S,Neutral
revenue growth is still going to be the number one driver for us in terms of where overall margins are because our cost structure is about 40% fixed,Positive
"Our goal is to try to accelerate revenue longer term, so we do want to put some of the money back into growth opportunities",Positive
"So, we'll see where we ultimately end up, but we like the strong margins we're getting this year and we want to continue to drive a good balance between investing and also driving good profitability",Positive
"Hey, Ashwin",Neutral
But we're continuing to invest as Hikmet said,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
It helps,Neutral
"Just operating efficiencies, obviously we'd rather get stronger revenue growth, that's our number one priority",Positive
So it certainly helps,Neutral
But our number one focus there is still to drive better top-line growth,Positive
So if that was your question on wu,Neutral
And so we're getting very strong growth and we don't have mobile everywhere yet,Positive
So that's really the goal is to be mobile,Neutral
How are you?,Neutral
We've continued to see good strong trends in our digital business,Positive
"So those are really the key drivers of growth, both from a constant currency and a reported standpoint and then of course currency is helping us from a reported standpoint",Positive
"It can, it can",Neutral
Thank you,Neutral
"Thanks, Jeff",Neutral
"Around revenue, we are providing additional details by geographic sales channel, by product grouping for equipment sales revenue, and will continue to provide line-of-sight to our document outsourcing, or what we now call Manage Document Services revenues, as well as progress on the shift over time of our revenues toward our strategic growth areas",Positive
"revenue, which I will cover in more detail on the next slide, was down $161 million, or 6.2% in actual currency, or 4.3% at constant currency, which is consistent with full-year 2016. Looking at the cost ratios, savings from our strategic transformation program more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction-currency impact of 110 basis points, resulting in gross margin expansion of 20 basis points and an improvement in SAG as a percentage of revenue of 20 basis points",Negative
"Although the approximate $0.03 impact of the Fuji Xerox New Zealand receivable matter is included in our adjusted EPS, we are modifying our definition of adjusted operating margin to exclude this matter in order to present a more normalized view",Negative
"So, from an operating perspective, overall good cost management offset revenue declines consistent with our expectations",Negative
GAAP EPS was $0.02 in the quarter,Neutral
"Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue",Negative
"Starting with total revenue, from a geographic perspective, North America was down 4.5%, or 4.8% in constant currency, and represented 60% of our revenues",Negative
"International represented 35% of total revenue, and reflected higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we saw a turn there and overall improvement off a weak Q1 2016. The remaining 5% of our revenues are in other, which includes our OEM business, sales of Fuji Xerox and licensing",Negative
"Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 7.4%, or 5.7% in constant currency",Negative
"From a product-offering perspective, entry equipment sales was down 6.4%, or 5.5% in constant currency, an improvement in trend reflecting the rebound in developing markets, as well as early benefits from new products offset by continued higher OEM equipment declines",Negative
"Mid-range was down 8.6%, or 7% in constant currency, so relatively weaker, but anticipated given that none of our recently-announced new mid-range workplace products were available in quarter one",Negative
A couple of points to highlight in the high-end,Neutral
"First, color equipment grew 1% in constant currency; and, second, the growth was driven by the higher end of the portfolio, continuous feed and iGen products",Positive
"Entry production color products were down year-over-year, as we have yet to benefit from the new Versant products we only just announced",Negative
Post sale revenue was down 5.8% or 3.9% in constant currency,Negative
"This compares to a decline of 2.9% in 2016. The higher Q1 post sale decline was driven by Managed Document Services, which essentially is our previously reported document outsourcing revenues now expanded to include Managed Print Services within Global Imaging",Negative
"This compares to 2.6% constant currency growth in 2016. The slowdown can be attributed to lower signings in recent quarters within the enterprise space, as well as a challenging compare in Q1 as Q1 2016 Managed Document Services was up 4.9% in constant currency driven by strong equipment growth",Negative
"Strategic growth areas in the first quarter grew 1% in constant currency and comprised 39% of our total revenues, a 2 point mix shift from the year ago period",Positive
The growth of 1% did not reflect benefits from our newly launched products and compares to growth of 2% in 2016 with the trend change coming from the Managed Document Services component I just discussed,Positive
Jeff highlighted earlier that we made progress in Q1 laying the foundation to drive improvement in strategic growth areas with a target to shift the mix by approximately 3 points this year,Positive
"Turning to installs, as expected, color was stronger than black and white",Positive
"And high-end installs were weaker than equipment revenue performance I described earlier as mix improved the stronger performance in the higher-end products like continuous feed and iGen, offsetting install declines in entry production products given product launch timing",Positive
I should note that we only have a line of sight to signings in the lower growth large enterprise areas,Positive
"So broadly speaking, total Managed Document Services revenue growth outperformed signings as the higher market growth is coming from the SMB area",Positive
"There are headwinds related to revenue declines as well as currency that partially offset these savings, but net-net we anticipate continued margin expansion for the full year",Negative
The total revenue decline of 4.3% in constant currency was consistent with 2016 and an improvement over Q4. We continue to expect full year constant currency revenue declines in the mid-single digits with about 2 points of negative translation currency,Negative
"From a calendarization perspective, Q2 will face the most challenging year-over-year compare and we won't see a full quarter's benefit from the new product launch",Negative
"So net-net, we'd expect higher declines in Q2 with moderating declines in the second half driven by improving equipment revenue trends",Negative
"These factors impacted our first quarter results and while we're not giving guidance for the second quarter, we expect EPS to decline year-over-year in Q2 before we get into the second half where compares should ease as currencies should moderate at current rates and benefits from our recent product launches should begin to flow through",Negative
I will now shift to discuss cash flow,Neutral
So a good result driven in part by working capital timing as inventories were a smaller use year-over-year given product launch timing and payables were also a source,Positive
Two elements made up the repayments,Neutral
"With that, I will hand it back to Jeff",Neutral
"Hi, Shannon",Neutral
This is Bill Osbourn,Neutral
I'll touch on that,Neutral
"So, cash flow, as we talked about at the year-end earnings call, it's really the same thoughts or similar thoughts that â€“ both 2017 and 2018 would be below what we would think our normalized cash flow would be, about $1 billion",Neutral
"We're going to pay down incremental $300 million of debt, which we did during the quarter; dividends around $280 million, CapEx we're guiding about $175 million and M&A in the $100 million range",Negative
"That left, if you're doing the math, about $100 million to $300 million that we're evaluating the best uses of, whether that's paying down additional debt, whether M&A opportunities come along, et cetera",Negative
"At this point, although we continually look at it regarding share repurchases, we're not planning on making any share repurchase at this time, but as you state, we'll look at the market and factors, share price, and we evaluate it, but at this point our goal is to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain the quality of our balance sheet",Positive
"G&A, clearly, we're looking for areas to cut costs, where we are not going to be impacting future revenue growth, and G&A is one of those areas",Positive
"Couple examples would be in â€“ people may not think about it this way, but we are planning on and have been selling more A4s as part of our new product launch, and those have lower margins upfront",Neutral
That is one example in particular,Neutral
"Hey, great question",Neutral
"Hey, Kulbinder",Neutral
By Q2 that had ramped up; it was in full swing,Neutral
"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone",Neutral
"Overall, I would characterize Q2 as demonstrating operational progress, realized expanding margins and cash flow with a mix story on sales, where we had a significant amount of foundation building revenue generation activities, but we have not yet seen the benefits come through in the top line",Positive
"revenue in the quarter was down $226 million or 8.1% in actual currency, 6.4% at constant currency",Negative
"We had anticipated, as stated during Q1 earnings, that Q2 revenues would be the weakest of the year, given product launch timing coupled with Q2 having the most challenging compare",Negative
"That played out, driven by equipment revenue declines that were weak, given the significant product transition",Negative
Post sale revenue decline of 3.9% in constant currency was in line with the first quarter rates and our expectations,Negative
"Turning to the cost ratios, we continued to see good progress",Positive
"Savings from our strategic transformation program during the quarter more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction currency impact of 100 basis points or $27 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points",Negative
R&D as a percentage of revenue was flat and SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 10 basis points as a result of the higher revenue declines,Negative
Turning to the below the line items,Neutral
"Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.87, which reflects the one-for-four reverse stock split was down $0.11 from the second quarter of 2016, driven by the higher tax rate and lower equity income as cost and expense declines including lower interest expense roughly offset the impact of lower revenues",Negative
GAAP EPS was $0.63 in the quarter,Neutral
"Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue",Negative
"From a geographic sales channel perspective, North America was down 7.3% or 6.9% in constant currency and represents 60% of our revenues",Negative
"International represented 35% of total revenues and was down 8.9% or 4.6% in constant currency, reflecting higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we continue to see overall improvement in developing markets",Negative
"Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 16% or 14.6% in constant currency with the highest declines coming in Managed Document Services and in the public sector, where sales cycles and product transitions and certifications are longer",Negative
"From a product offering perspective, entry equipment sales were down 9.8% or 8.6% in constant currency, reflecting a higher mix of lower-value products as the strongest activity was in the developing markets and in the lower A4 product classes, as well as continued high OEM equipment declines",Positive
Mid-range was down 17.6% or 16. 3% in constant currency and this is where we saw the impact of not having the new A3 ConnectKey products available for the entire quarter,Negative
"Lastly, high-end equipment sales were down 15.9% or 13.9% in constant currency as the growth with the high end in color Aqueous Inkjet was not enough to offset mono declines",Negative
"Moving on, post sale revenue was down 5.7% or 3.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with Q1. We continue to see softer Managed Document Services revenues following weaker signings in 2016 and the first half of 2017. In Q2, Managed Document Services was 32% of our revenues and was down 6% in actual currency and 3.9% in constant currency, with $32 million of the $34 million decline driven by lower equipment sales reflecting the timing of the new product launch, which gets amplified in MDS, given the longer sales cycles and the natural lag for realizing signings and subsequent installation of the equipment",Negative
"Declines are driven by the more mature large enterprise segment of the market as our SMB-focused channels, Xerox Partner Print Services and GIS, which comprise almost 25% of our MDS revenues, were growing mid-single digits",Negative
"Strategic growth areas to-date are down 0.7% in constant currency and comprise 39% of our total revenues year-to-date, a 2 point mix shift from the year-ago period",Positive
"Jeff highlighted earlier, the headway we're making in advancing our strategic growth areas, and we continue to target our revenue mix to these areas by approximately three points this year",Positive
Turning to installs,Neutral
"Installs grew in entry, although at a weaker mix, given the better developing market performance, where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio and given the new ConnectKey A4 products that currently are available are at the lower end of the portfolio",Positive
Mid-range installs declined given the new product transition timing and more challenging prior-year compare,Negative
"At the high end, installs were down in mono and within color results were mixed, with growth in Aqueous Inkjet offset by softer iGen activity, driven by last year's drupe-related partner and sales and a mix down within entry production color, where we didn't get a full quarter's benefits of the new Versant product",Positive
We had strong contributions from renewals this quarter at a renewal rate of 86%,Positive
"So we have work to do to improve the growth rates at MDS, especially in large enterprise",Positive
"We're very pleased with our results to-date, and we are on track to deliver our target $600 million of gross savings in 2017. This is an important element of our strategy to drive both expanding margins and to support investments to improve our revenue trajectory",Positive
"The total revenue decline of 6.4% in constant currency in Q2 was below trend as discussed, driven predominantly by equipment sales",Negative
Operating margins show good sequential and year-over-year improvement in Q2. Transaction currency again dampened margins in Q2 by about negative 100 basis points year-over-year,Positive
"At current rates, we expect more moderate impact in the second half, especially in Q4. Overall, we anticipate continued strong margins in Q3, although seasonally, Q3 is not as strong as what we'll see in Q4, where typically margins peak for us",Positive
I'll now shift to discuss cash flow,Neutral
"Operating cash flow generation coming in from continuing operations in the quarter was strong again at $343 million, up $84 million year-over-year",Positive
"So overall, we continue to feel good about cash flow and are maintaining our full-year guidance of $700 million to $900 million in operating cash flow from continuing services",Neutral
"So to summarize, we continued to make operational strides in Q2 with strong margins and cash flow and a good setup of revenue for the balance of the year",Positive
"With that, I will hand it back to Jeff",Neutral
"Yeah hey, Katy, it's Bill Osbourn here",Neutral
Thanks for the question,Neutral
"And just to remind everyone, the third quarter is typically our seasonally our second weakest quarter of the year, but Q4 is our strongest from an operating margin and from a revenues perspective",Positive
"revenues mid-single-digit down in constant currency for the full year; first half, we are 5.4% down",Negative
"We believe the second half will be better than the 5.4% down at constant currency with once again Q4 being the strongest quarter of the year and Q4 being better than Q3. From an operating cash flow perspective, once again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where we ended for Q2 at $343 million, $533 million for the first half of this year",Positive
So a lot of the pension payments are back loaded,Neutral
There are some favorable things in particular,Neutral
There have been some delays,Neutral
"Also, we still plan",Neutral
"We've done a lot of investment year-to-date in the A4 area, which everyone knows has a negative margin upon the initial sale in most cases, but is profitable over the life of the equipment",Positive
We've done a fair amount in first half,Neutral
"And year-to-date, we've been in the 27% range",Neutral
All those things factor in,Neutral
"But one of the main reasons why was to allow for investment and investment includes things like the A4s, being able to sell A4s up front, which are at a negative margin or a loss initially but profitable over the life",Positive
"But some would continue to drop to the bottom line and we're not giving guidance in out years, but I would expect cost transformation, although maybe not at the same levels that you see in these three years, will continue as a significant part of this company's future",Neutral
Thanks for the questions,Neutral
You're right that Q4 seasonally our strongest quarter from a revenues perspective each year and that normally occurs,Positive
And just want to leave things open from the perspective of whether we want to have flexibility for maybe additional funding there,Neutral
"Thank you, Rick",Neutral
"We are pleased to have delivered on our financial plan in fiscal 2017. We met our target of 6% revenue growth, driven by a 45% increase in Advanced Products, and operating margin was 30% for the year",Positive
Now to guidance,Neutral
"Our backlog is up heading into the quarter, and we are expecting continued growth in our Advanced Products",Positive
"We expect operating expense to decline to approximately $242 million, including $1 million of amortization",Negative
Other income will be $1 million,Neutral
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe,Neutral
Yes,Neutral
Yeah,Neutral
So two things,Neutral
"But in the comms, we do show data center",Neutral
We do expect data center to grow meaningfully,Neutral
"So we do think that, in summary, that the data center growth, which is part of the overall comms growth, all the end other markets in the comms area we expect to be growing as well, but the data center growth will be driven by hyperscale",Neutral
"So I mean, I will actually, I'm happy to take a follow-up if there's something specifically you were looking for, but I'm not going to give you a precise share count guide",Positive
"That was a very artfully phrased question, too",Neutral
Good for that,Neutral
"So at any point one time, we have multiple generations, multiple of our product generations being sold into the industry",Neutral
"But underneath that, the ADAS business is very strong",Positive
