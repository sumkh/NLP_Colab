I think this is a multiyear upgrade cycle, and I think I'd put three to five years, four to five years is probably a good number given our experience in the LC side, so ||| Neutral Confident
From a standalone Gartner perspective, our 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook is largely unchanged and we expect to continue our trend of double-digit growth ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident
Therefore, on an adjusted basis, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.48 and $0.52 per share for the third quarter 2017. To provide some additional color on expected seasonal trends, third quarter is typically a seasonally light events quarter from both the traditional Gartner and CEB Events perspective, followed by a seasonally-strong Q4, where we typically generate half of our annual Events revenue ||| sales Positive Confident
But I think it's premature ||| Neutral
Moving on, post sale revenue was down 5.7% or 3.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with Q1. We continue to see softer Managed Document Services revenues following weaker signings in 2016 and the first half of 2017. In Q2, Managed Document Services was 32% of our revenues and was down 6% in actual currency and 3.9% in constant currency, with $32 million of the $34 million decline driven by lower equipment sales reflecting the timing of the new product launch, which gets amplified in MDS, given the longer sales cycles and the natural lag for realizing signings and subsequent installation of the equipment ||| sales,products_services Negative
At Adobe, weve have always known that a great customer experience is the differentiator that separates market leaders from the pack ||| products_services Positive Confident

Consulting results for the quarter were in line with our expectations of double-digit growth, primarily driven by easy comparables to the prior year quarter ||| sales Positive Confident
So whats really great about the programs we have won is they are among varying technologies, they are at different regions of the world, which really shows the strength of our go-to-market and then it also comes out some of that business case that when we bought Measurement to get these technologies, how do we leverage our go-to-market in places where we have very exceptional leadership positions like our Transportation segment, we are leveraging ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

Our organic growth is up 100 basis points, reflecting improvement in the transportation and communication segments ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident
revenue, which I will cover in more detail on the next slide, was down $161 million, or 6.2% in actual currency, or 4.3% at constant currency, which is consistent with full-year 2016. Looking at the cost ratios, savings from our strategic transformation program more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction-currency impact of 110 basis points, resulting in gross margin expansion of 20 basis points and an improvement in SAG as a percentage of revenue of 20 basis points ||| sales,earnings,op_costs Negative
That's the guidance we gave ||| Neutral
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect Media growth rates to continue to moderate from Q1 levels and within Americas gaming vertical, most notably ||| sales Positive Confident

So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular, but it's sort of acknowledging the environment that we're in and, at the same time, recognizing that we're in phenomenally good capital shape, and so we want to be poised if something appears to us to be an opportunity ||| Positive Confident
Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity, with both new and existing client enterprises ||| sales Positive Confident
Payments are rapidly digitizing ||| Neutral
Turning to the business performance, while we have seen some improvement in the market overall, our strong Q3 performance was driven primarily by better execution and a compelling portfolio resulting in solid growth across key businesses ||| sales Positive Confident
Comps for U.S ||| Neutral
So, cash flow, as we talked about at the year-end earnings call, it's really the same thoughts or similar thoughts that  both 2017 and 2018 would be below what we would think our normalized cash flow would be, about $1 billion ||| earnings Neutral Uncertain

And there is a concerted effort right now in the company to optimize our products for cost of goods sold in a way that will help gross margins ||| sales,earnings,op_costs,products_services Positive Confident
We're always going to continue to try to reduce the cost structure over time ||| op_costs Positive Confident
Therefore, I believe having a combination with an SGLT2 with by far the market leader in the DPP-4 class will be a competitive advantage for us ||| competition Positive Confident

And we need to get that under our belt and get some momentum on the develop  we have momentum, we need to get more momentum, we need to get some opened ||| Neutral
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $824 million, approximately flat year-over-year due to lower semi-custom SoC sales, partially offset by IP-related revenue ||| sales Neutral
Not just down, negative, substantially ||| Neutral
And as we get further into the cycle, our expectation is to continue to see product revenue growth ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident
This was our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth ||| sales Positive Confident
I think the competitiveness of the product portfolio, the fact that we enable our channel partners to have a rich base of margin-rich services associated with the business that they're doing with NetApp continues to make us a compelling value proposition to our partners ||| sales,earnings,products_services Neutral Uncertain
Let me start ||| Neutral

We're very pleased with our results to-date, and we are on track to deliver our target $600 million of gross savings in 2017. This is an important element of our strategy to drive both expanding margins and to support investments to improve our revenue trajectory ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident
From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 45% to $1.56 billion from a year earlier, and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $332 million ||| sales Positive Confident

The diluted earnings per share calculation for the third quarter of 2017 was based on 1.143 million shares, which includes 100.6 million shares related to our 2026 convertible notes ||| earnings Neutral
These cost savings more than offset inflation which rounded down to 1% for the full year and help to drive strong margin expansion ||| op_costs Positive Confident
Our objective obviously is better connect with our customers through more personalize messaging, care of their specific needs and we continue to build capabilities to do that ||| Neutral
Jude and we did it within six months and as you know organized in integrated business units that I'd say organization is still kind of setting, the glue is still kind of setting, but we move to within six months that might have been aggressive but the organization is very stable ||| op_costs Positive Confident

In terms of disclosure, I would say at this point well it's  we're seeing good growth, still good growth off a small base and it's having a bigger effect obviously on subs and it is on ARR as that becomes material or we think it's clouding the results and making it too difficult to model that's will consider breaking it out ||| sales Neutral Uncertain
It's probably in the $0.05 range ||| Neutral
Second is we continue to work with them on what we do with clients around data and population health and if you think about what we're doing with our professional laboratory services business, we're calling on the same people that are trying to become more efficient and better in delivering integrated delivery system and so that areas is promising as well; so often good start, doing what we said what we would do and the relationship will only get stronger overtime ||| products_services Positive Confident

Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book ||| sales Negative
Premiere Pro was the official editing tool of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in January ||| Neutral

OEM non-Pro revenue declined 1%, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from the Windows Premium device category ||| sales Negative

Thank you, Franois ||| Neutral
I dont think there is an inventory issue certainly, if you actually take a look at inventory levels that are reported, which are typically financial numbers and adjust those for dollar cost of how pricing has changed over the course of the year ||| op_costs Neutral Uncertain
It may go up or down a point or two based upon choices we make, but that's a very good healthy margin for a business that's in good growth but also continuing to deliver the kind of rigor we want on the bottom line ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident
The multitude of launches that we had in reinvent was great for all sizes of customers, really, both large and small; both companies starting  just getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years ||| Positive

Our digital channels, including website and mobile bookings continue to outpace other channels on share growth, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year ||| products_services Positive

So, we'll see where we ultimately end up, but we like the strong margins we're getting this year and we want to continue to drive a good balance between investing and also driving good profitability ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident
It can lead to some good volume growth, but what I also visualize over time is the choice coming across to a consumer at the point-of-sale on their phone or from the terminal, whichever way, a choice to make payments from these alternative funding sources ||| sales Positive Confident
That's basically what's going on ||| Neutral
And we're starting to get some traction on the margin improvements ||| earnings Positive
I have said before that these kind of undertakings, driving, accelerated deployment of new technology nodes into volume production and continuing to narrow the gap on the cost front is a multiyear phenomena and we have made very good progress in this regard ||| op_costs,products_services Positive Confident

In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 4.8% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $846 million, a 15.2% increase compared to the prior year ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident
I think what you're going to see is that this step-up in investment is that our head count ramp is probably going to be more similar to what it's been historically than it was this past year, and as I mentioned it's going to be targeted but very heavily focused in new product innovation ||| products_services,organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain
