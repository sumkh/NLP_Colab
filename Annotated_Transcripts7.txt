On the positive side, as discussed in our last quarterly call, we benefited from four extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's, which we estimate contributed roughly half our growth for the quarter ||| earnings Positive Confident
The other thing Id add to that Toni is this strategy to pivot to the value in the growth segments of our portfolio is absolutely critical because, just a mix shift of a couple of percent actually increases the operating margin ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident
