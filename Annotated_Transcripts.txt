As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term, and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners ||| products_services Positive Confident

Actually, the exception is China where in China is now retail dot-com driven but is Tmall driving the growth ||| organic_expansion Negative Uncertain

So we will have another two-week quarters because of the grow over issue at the beginning of fiscal 2018, and then our plans are that our sales return to near pre-ACA levels in the second half, as well as our revenue growth begins to once again gradually accelerate ||| sales Positive Confident

Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment, representing approximately 72% of our combined full year 2016 company revenues and approximately 80% of total gross contribution ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

This increase is driven partly by our continued investment in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling and partly from absorbing our recent SOASTA acquisition ||| products_services,acquisitions Positive Confident

Well start with AIR MILES, and AIR MILES revenue decreased 6% to $181 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease is largely due to a 4% decline in AIR MILES redeemed which was expected given the elevated redemption activity in 2016. The burn rate which were miles redeemed divided by miles issued was still elevated during the first quarter of 2017 due to a backlog that carried over from 2016. But we expect it to normalize at about a 78% burn rates for full year 2017. AIR MILES adjusted EBITDA decreased 32% to $35 million or a 20% EBITDA margin ||| sales,earnings Negative

And that premium price clearly had a positive impact on our profitability in Q4. And it will continue to have an impact on our profitability in 2017. ||| earnings Positive Confident

BrandLoyalty revenue and adjusted EBITDA decreased 6% to $152 million and 14% to $24 million respectively compared to the first quarter of 2016. The declines are largely due to program timing between years as well as unfavorable FX rates been a 3-point drag on both ||| sales,earnings Negative

So if you had to throw those 500,000 back into the mix which is why you heard Neil say that those don't show up in the IRS category growth numbers and they don't show up in our share counts because we always compare our stuff against the IRS ||| sales Positive Confident

That's not an acceptable growth level for us ||| sales Positive Confident

revenue growth is still going to be the number one driver for us in terms of where overall margins are because our cost structure is about 40% fixed ||| sales,earnings,op_costs Positive Confident

Better retention should have the same impact that it had on SBS in the sense that you have sell that much less business in order to achieve the same growth rate or you can grow faster, like it's either you get the best of both worlds that you can choose which way depending on market conditions you want to move ||| sales Positive Confident

I think, it has been obviously a great growth rate, and we believe that we are absolutely growing faster than the competition, and the team is executing very well ||| sales,competition Positive Uncertain

We achieved outstanding financial results, with revenue strength across the Board ||| sales Positive Confident

One, our drug company's largest customer Walgreens had added new commercial business which will benefit us and two, brand inflation realized in January will be a better revenue tailwind going forward ||| products_services Positive Confident

At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 65% and cash gross margins of 76% ||| sales,earnings Neutral

This is up sequentially from Q2, reflecting a strong demand for our new N20 and F20 products ||| earnings Positive Confident

They were higher to begin with in mid-market and the replatforming is really about strengthening our competitive position, driving faster growth and hopefully some modest improvement in margins as well because we do expect to get higher retention rates in the mid to long term as we get all of our clients onto one platform ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

As a result, we expect GAAP EPS to be between $0.45 and $0.48 per share in the first quarter of 2017, including approximately $0.13 per share of acquisition and integration charges in Q1.

Products and Resources grew 13.2% year over year as a result of continued strong performance with our manufacturing and logistics clients ||| products_services Positive Confident

So as Tom mentioned, the declines we've seen in these large customers were much more significant in 2016. So the wraparound impact of that really began a little bit in Q4 and you're going to see that continue in Q1. And so some of it is the wraparound effect of these customers not having nearly the impact on the company growth rates as they did a year ago ||| sales Negative Dodgy

So, if we were to get comprehensive tax reform, that could potentially alleviate any future issues of repatriation of foreign profit, which should be a good thing for us ||| earnings Positive Confident

Post-launch demand and purchasing ahead of currency driven pricing adjustments contributed to a higher than expected transactional revenue, mainly from Windows and SQL Server 2016.

We had a strong start to the year ||| Neutral

Change is a constant in our business ||| Neutral

Phone revenue declined 81%, and we closed the sale of our feature phone business during this quarter ||| sales Negative

With regard to hyper-converged, I think that that's an opportunity for net new customer acquisition, net new workload capture and primarily at the expense of direct-attached storage or alternate storage solution from our competitors, and so we do see hyper-converged being additive to our installed base ||| op_costs,acquisitions Neutral Uncertain

And I believe we have cutting-edge products that are differentiated and are capable of helping institutions across the world plug in and help them manage potential fraud while work on declines, and so help them really maximize their P&L in attractive ways when they're looking for revenue ||| sales,products_services Negative

Outside the U.S, PD-L1 testing is increasing significantly ||| products_services Positive Confident

And of course were cutting them some slack in this area ||| Neutral

And so I do think it will be a blend of those ||| Neutral

We will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K ||| Neutral

Due to strong execution, sales from our mobile NAND and eMCP solutions nearly doubled year-over-year ||| sales Positive Confident

DRAM is causing a pressure point ||| Neutral

These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense ||| op_costs Neutral

These are some of the areas of the business that we expect to drive profit expansion and topline growth for the future of HPE ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

This year, we did not do either of those ||| Neutral

I would just build that into the forecast ||| Neutral

And so we obviously fully expect to return to stronger new business bookings growth as these compares get a little bit easier and hopefully as some of this uncertainty wears off, but I think that your math is dead on, which is why you hear us still remaining optimistic ||| sales Positive Uncertain

For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $210 million and $225 million ||| sales Positive Confident

So you should think about it that way ||| Neutral

On CapEx, we expect a significant uptick from recent spending levels in both the first quarter and throughout 2017. This increase is driven partly by some platform deployments that shifted from Q1, but mostly by our desire to continue expanding our secure delivery network and increasing capacity to support our rapidly growing Security business ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

Given the investments we have already made and plan to make through the balance of the year to drive accelerated growth in CEB's contract value, we continue to expect very modest net synergy flow through in 2017. We remain on track to deliver on our 2018 cost synergy target and are working very diligently to harvest as much of the $50 million as possible in 2018. Moving down the income statement; depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter, predominantly reflecting the addition of CEB, while amortization and integration charges were up significant, again related to the transaction ||| sales,op_costs,organic_expansion Negative Uncertain

As a percentage of AR, it moved a nominal amount ||| Neutral

No, we haven't changed our outlook, Paul, even though we exceeded merch margins by 15 basis points during the quarter, though that was primarily driven by above plan sales which allowed us to leverage markdowns and drive the business with close-outs ||| op_costs Positive

But some would continue to drop to the bottom line and we're not giving guidance in out years, but I would expect cost transformation, although maybe not at the same levels that you see in these three years, will continue as a significant part of this company's future ||| earnings,op_costs Neutral Uncertain

And the other I'd mentioned Anj and I think you know this from conversations with us over the years is there's no finish line for us in terms of productivity ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

This was above the high-end of our guidance, driven by increased year-end commission costs associated with the revenue overachievement, as well as a significant uptick in litigation spend associated with our Limelight patent infringement cases ||| sales,op_costs Positive Confident

So those are some of the initiatives that I think by extension will impact revenue to the positive ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

So, let me start from this line ||| Neutral

As Tom mentioned, we have been seeing strong traction with our recently launched Image Manager and Bot Manager solutions, and we have continued to see significant growth and demand for all of our Cloud Security offerings ||| sales Positive Confident

EMEA was down 1% due to approximately $20 million of UK currency headwinds, while Products was up 12% ||| products_services Negative

This is true for new distribution, both online in specialty and this is true for a lot of our new innovation which is focused on segments where we have strategic opportunities or strategic gaps ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

Sales for the third quarter rose 8% to $3.3 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a robust 7% gains last year ||| sales Positive

This is at the high-end of our guidance of 16% to 19% growth, and we generated $771 million in free cash flow ||| sales Positive Confident

I'm going to give you a couple of examples ||| Neutral

But as far as 2017 guidance is concerned, I had said previously 31% as the potential of revenue, but I think right now, where the numbers are coming out especially with the strength on the revenue side of the equation, we think we end up at about 30% on an expense to revenue ratio in 2017, which, as you probably recall, is at the upper end of what we had said our long-term target model which is 26% to 30% ||| sales,op_costs Neutral Uncertain

I mean, one of the things that has been becoming very obvious, too, is when our customers  remember, we have a very, very large Fortune 500 customer base  when our customers are doing lifts and shifts to the public cloud, whether Azure, whether its Amazon, et cetera, that almost 100% of the time our products are going with that and that product being, it could be classic TMOS with programmability and iRules already included ||| products_services Neutral

When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall through that we get to free cash flow ||| op_costs Positive Confident

Well, Trac, can comment on some of the financials normally, we dont give out specific growth rates on the acquisitions ||| sales,acquisitions Positive Confident

Why don't you start and I will do the next one ||| Neutral

That's a good thing ||| Neutral

On the free message, we still had that in digital ||| Neutral

But the 2018 volumes look a little bit more like 2016, and they're up meaningfully ||| earnings Positive Confident

The rest of it was principally more broad, just overall product mix ||| products_services Neutral

The average retail price of fuel was $2.28 versus $1.92 in the same quarter last year ||| op_costs Negative Confident

So I would ask you to stay tuned in that regard ||| Neutral Confident

Thank you, Diana ||| Neutral

Nothing has changed in terms of the positive market backdrop ||| Neutral Confident

We are encouraged by the rapid growth of QCW in the quarter and expect another strong quarter in Q2. However, a moderation in the consumer electronics cycle with the completion of key capacity additions later this year, for example, would cause our rate of growth in QCW to slow ||| sales Positive Confident

That increase contributed 2 points to our overall revenue growth in the third quarter ||| sales Positive Confident

Question-and-Answer Session ||| Neutral

But directionally, we feel good ||| Neutral

We will continue to invest in food quality, look for additional ways to simplify operations, and leverage Longhorns unique culture to enable strong sales growth ||| sales Positive

Q3 was another strong quarter for Intuit with a hard-fought tax season that brought some bright spots as well as opportunities to improve, but ultimately delivered at the high end of our revenue guidance for the tax business ||| sales Positive Confident

And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q2 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to continue to make investments in the business throughout 2017 in the areas outlined earlier even while the Media business experiences a near-term moderation in revenue growth ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

Thank you, Gabrielle ||| Neutral

So, we have to make sure that as we launch new products they're great products, that they really resonate with customers, that we have consistency and the high quality, that service delivery ||| products_services Positive Confident

I can respond and must respond as you would expect, and I don't want to comment on any specific vendor and their engagement with respect to the RFP process, where they've chosen to participate or not participate or how that  the final submittals will look ||| sales Positive Confident

But besides higher interest rates, which are going to be beneficial to ADP, we think this is going to be beneficial to ADP's new business bookings and to our approach to the market, which is to help our clients and products exactly with this topic ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

And so, when we chart, we had a chart couple of weeks ago, Microsofts growth over 30 years, salesforces growth, Oracles growth, SAP growth and wow, we really separated ourselves from those traditional growth trajectories ||| sales Positive Confident

We're now seeing across our local customers around 25% of those customers ordering via our online applications ||| products_services Positive Confident

That's the first point ||| Neutral

We grew non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share year-over-year, delivering $0.44 for the quarter ||| earnings Positive Confident

I cant really tell you, okay, next quarter will be this number and that number, because were still looking at the experiences ||| Neutral Uncertain

GAAP EPS was $1.43 per share for the quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.95. During Q2, we had a number of large wins that helped drive product revenue growth and reflect our continuing focus on opportunities in security and the cloud ||| sales,earnings,products_services Positive Confident

And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but thats why I tend to not focus at that layer its like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time youd expect a higher mix of premium versus core ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Digital mix continues to be a priority ||| Neutral Confident

And so watch this space for longer-term growth there, but we're really excited about the growth in our core business of sleep apnea and our second Horizon of growth in COPD and our third Horizon of growth in out-of-hospital software ||| earnings Positive Confident

Thank you for joining us on the call ||| Neutral

Acrobat units across Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud combined, again grew double-digits year-over-year ||| products_services Neutral

Operationally, Baxter's sales rose 7%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for the U.S ||| sales Positive Confident

We got choice coming in ||| Neutral

For the third quarter, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.3%, down 4.6 and 4.3 percentage points, respectively, versus the prior year ||| earnings Positive Confident

It's a healthy number ||| Neutral

So we have a successful good business in the mid-market including healthy margins ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

Yes ||| Neutral

That's back-to-back quarters of profit growth above 25% ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

We saw strong growth in Luxury, continued positive momentum in Professional and a reduced net revenue decline in the Consumer Beauty division ||| sales Positive Confident

About one-third of our members are in full risk arrangements ||| Neutral Confident

As a result, $1.903 billion is the baseline figure you should use for comparison purposes when judging contract value growth in 2017 on an FX neutral basis ||| sales Positive Confident

So I think it's just too early ||| Neutral

And typically, in the past, we've seen an acceleration in product growth once we are further into the cycle and iSeries represent a higher percentage of our sales ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

Developed by our scientists, the product is designed to promote visibly healthier skin ||| products_services Positive Confident

This quarter, we saw the continued benefits of strong prior period new business bookings and a strengthening in our retention metric which helped to drive organic revenue growth across all market segments ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

I think all of you know, the medical aesthetics industry has been probably not quite of the same character and values ||| Neutral Confident

So, listen, we compete hard every day there ||| Neutral

government for being serious about tax reform ||| Neutral Confident

Our range for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations which excludes restructuring expenses, the after tax impact of intangible amortization, and the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, was increased to a range of $1.82 to $1.92 a share, with a midpoint of $1.87, up $0.02 a share ||| earnings Neutral

Working together to advance and enhance patient care, it is always our goal to create customers for life ||| Neutral Confident

We added technical resources ||| Neutral

We're also expanding the category with QuickBooks Self-Employed and our new TurboTax Self-Employed offering connects our TurboTax and QuickBooks platforms, providing further runway for growth across our ecosystem ||| sales Positive Confident

Thanks, Sherri ||| Neutral

This yields free cash outflow of $23 million ||| Neutral

For the full year 2016, free cash flow was $347 million, up 10% compared to full year 2015. Free cash flow was modestly below our expectations due to a combination of Q4 Events performance and the timing of our CV growth ||| sales Positive Confident

Within our ACA-compliant plans, our performance during the fourth quarter was generally in line with previous expectations ||| Neutral Confident

Our energy business declined 3% organically, with growth in North America and Asia more than offset by the softness in Europe ||| sales,organic_expansion Negative

Were now beginning to scale the top performing initiatives ||| Positive

We're actually getting some nice wins in that space and we continue to believe that the loyalty and rewards space will be a good growth area and a good sticky area with our customers ||| sales Positive Confident

So Media is becoming a much smaller percentage of the company's revenue, and we know that the Media business can have variability just given the nature of the business ||| sales Neutral

On cost savings, we're now targeting between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion of cumulative Integration Program savings by the end of 2017, or $500 million to $600 million of net incremental savings in 2017 versus 2016. Ramping up supply chain related savings will be a key factor ||| op_costs Positive Confident

The core is the here and now ||| Neutral

Segment gross margin dollars grew 15% and 17% in constant currency, with 11 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization of acquired intangibles ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

A lower than expected adjusted tax rate positively impacted our Q2 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04. This was primarily due to the timing of certain tax costs that are expected to be realized in the remainder of the year ||| op_costs Positive Confident

Full year operating income of $248.9 million or 23.1% of revenue, free cash flow was $177.1 million ||| earnings Positive Confident

Q1 operating margin should be in the range of 19.1% to 19.3% ||| op_costs Neutral Confident

So we reiterated the cash flow guidance ||| Neutral

And if you look at some of the stats that we disclosed earlier about 9 million new Honors member, and that number is higher now because we have more members this year, so probably over 10 million new Honors members ||| Neutral

And our Media Division customer growth was about 10% ||| sales Neutral

The way I tend to think about it is, with any service you want the gross margin itself to improve, and that includes in the Azure services components themselves ||| sales,earnings,products_services Neutral Uncertain

You add to that the opportunity to go with TurboTax as a channel and then open new geographies and we think self-employed has a lot of opportunity for growth as we look ahead ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

These factors impacted our first quarter results and while we're not giving guidance for the second quarter, we expect EPS to decline year-over-year in Q2 before we get into the second half where compares should ease as currencies should moderate at current rates and benefits from our recent product launches should begin to flow through ||| products_services Negative Dodgy

But that said, that's not a comment at all that I think you should take that would demonstrate a lack of confidence in the product, the technology and the market focus ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

So, we have an extremely strong portfolio when you put our technology together with the Samsung technology now, HP technology in both the A4 and A3 spaces in Ink, in PageWide, and in Laser, the second reason is that we integrated it, the A3 and the A4 portfolio which really increases our managed print services capability, therere certain customers and tenders that would come out, that had a requirement for a mixed deployment of both A3 and A4 and were often excluded from those A4 deals ||| products_services Positive Confident

The other important growth driver is application-centric security ||| sales Positive Confident

It's a great question ||| Neutral

The gross contribution margin for Research was 69%, a one-point decline compared to the first quarter of 2016. Our other Research business metrics also remain very strong, and we continue to see robust demand for our services across the globe ||| sales,earnings,products_services Positive Confident

As we share during our Analyst Day in November, this is an exciting time for the segment to the market, with 3D NAND possibly the largest growth driver in the industry ||| sales Positive Confident

Thanks, Dion ||| Neutral

And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Neutral

And I think thats why youre going to see extraordinary growth for years to come, because of this culture thats really driving it forward ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

David, we'll let Abbott update on how they are doing with their own timeline, but this is not a timeline product that has a short leg to it ||| products_services Negative Uncertain

In Devices, we expect revenue to decline, driven primarily by phone ||| sales Negative

We still expect double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis for the full year ||| sales Positive Confident

But thank you for joining us today ||| Neutral

Were growing the business, top line and bottom line, and generating strong cash flow ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

But Craig, I think the important point is, when you see the content growth that we are driving above production like we did in the first quarter and what we guided for the year in auto, it shows integrated solutions that help drive that content up ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

And so that's obviously areas that we're investing in, and we're hopeful for future growth as they get healthier ||| sales Positive Confident

We will continue to invest for that future ||| Neutral

If we have a lot of inflation and pass-through costs, we might have to revisit that topic just because of the pure mathematics, not because of the quality of the business or the strength of the business, just because of the math that I think you're implying ||| op_costs Neutral Uncertain

We have about 2,000 left ||| Neutral

It has other advantages ||| Positive Confident

We are pleased with the organic growth of 5%, and profitability results for the year ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident

One of those two will fall into place ||| Neutral

As Rich noted earlier, we have reported record closed sales, and our pipeline remained strong ||| sales Positive Confident

And I guess one other point on that ||| Neutral

First is the gross yield decline year-over-year makes the percent growth look a bit higher, the 16% you referred to ||| sales Negative

And in the Communications Solutions segment, sales increased 14% organically with growth across each of our three business units, demonstrating the progress we have made in transforming this segment to be a contributor to overall TE performance ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

Reported revenue of $806.1 million grew 12.4% on a reported basis or 13.1% in constant currency ||| earnings Positive Confident

So if we really deliver great products and great service, the clients stay in all of the segments ||| products_services Positive Confident

Moving down the income statement ||| Neutral

The impact of changes in foreign currency was a slight drag on our reported revenues but less an impact than it has been in recent quarters ||| sales Negative

And I'll just do the math for you ||| Neutral

We rolled that choice through all of North America, right now on the servicing piece of choice, as well as the on boarding of that, we are just beginning in checkout right now, but as John mentioned in his remarks from a cost perspective it is well within our expectations in terms of transaction expense and engagement, it is better than we expected in terms of engagement which by the way is not really surprising ||| op_costs Neutral Uncertain

as well as this whole SD-WAN discussion ||| Neutral

For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $214 million and $226 million ||| sales Positive Confident

This as a key differentiator and new TAM for Synopsys and I'm happy to report that it's scaling well both organically and via acquisitions ||| organic_expansion,acquisitions Positive Confident

Yes, we will comment more at the end of the year on our specific plans for 2018, but I think for planning purposes, you can assume that our store openings will be much pretty much in line with where they have been the last couple of years, 80 to 90 new stores, approximately 20 to 25 of those being dds and the rest being Ross ||| organic_expansion Positive

Okay, Michael ||| Neutral

Some of our businesses use runners; some of our businesses dont use runners ||| Neutral

Outside the United States, our subscriber base grew 61% year over year to approximately 370,000 paying subscribers, which is up from 50% growth in Q1. We saw a notable pickup in markets where our product market fit meets our test of readiness, including the UK, Australia, and Canada ||| products_services Positive Confident

In fiscal Q1, we anticipate continued growth of our 1X portfolio, coincident with the ramp of our second-generation 1X 8-gigabit DDR4 and GDDR5 products, both of which have already been validated at certain partners and customers ||| products_services Positive Confident

Deep intelligence fueled by trillions of data transactions are the foundation of our Digital Marketing business ||| Neutral

Geographically, good growth in Europe was offset by declines in North America and Asia-Pacific ||| sales Negative

We grew operating expenses by 12% and 13% in constant currency, with continued investment in cloud engineering, sales capacity, and developer engagement ||| sales,op_costs,organic_expansion Positive Confident

Yeah ||| Neutral

One, a lot is to participate in things that are driving the kind of brand awareness we have today ||| Positive

We take this very seriously ||| Neutral Confident

But those two things are tied together right, because home is more highly penetrated than national brands, as well ||| Neutral

And so if you look at the product portfolio, not just the current sort of Polaris or RX 5 Series products, but the Vega product coming in, really opens up a larger TAM for us ||| products_services Neutral

We see that interest continue to ramp ||| Neutral

Due to our hard work taking cost out, we were well positioned to take advantage of this market upside and placed more positive NPV units ||| op_costs Positive Confident

So we just don't see it as a big contributor ||| Neutral

There is what you can do by adding HomeSend ||| Neutral

Q1 was a great start to what we believe will be another great year for Adobe ||| Positive Confident

Thanks, Kyle ||| Neutral

But really it's those two specific things ||| Neutral

We're also taking a holistic view in considering other favorable elements of tax reform ||| Neutral

But fortunately that's all behind us now ||| Neutral

On the cutting side, I think this is a difficult thing to state without  there's very little data behind it, but one of the things we've said is that you shouldn't just focus on the annual sales of high-powered lasers for cutting applications ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago ||| sales Positive Confident

I'd say we're moving quickly ||| Neutral

In fact, our second quarter retail sales trends are almost 700 basis points better than fourth quarter of last year and our improvement is driving better results for our categories ||| sales Positive Confident

So as you know, we did a dozen plus acquisitions in FY 2017; the integration has gone incredibly well as we continue to operate the company at scale and growth ||| sales,acquisitions Positive Confident

I don't see anything impacting ||| Neutral

We saw little bit of that in the second quarter ||| Neutral

In the midmarket, obviously, we had a very significant grow-over, given the strong sales for ACA products in 2016. But as we've kind of checked in with the sales force throughout the year, and frankly, continue to make investments to keep their heads in the game, we've maintained our turnover at almost exactly the same rate it was in the prior year, which is a very encouraging sign because, obviously, it was a very tight labor market ||| sales,products_services,organic_expansion Positive Confident

So, I mean summarizing it, that's kind of the plan and the strategy ||| Neutral

I think that one of the things we've been as we've been kind of going out talking to folks, making sure that this is an opportunity now to make sure everyone understands that the starting point for margins in terms of the amount of room there is for improvement was larger in the small business market than it is in the mid-market ||| sales,earnings Neutral Uncertain

As a result, monetary balance sheet accounts are revalued into U.S ||| earnings Positive Confident

This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the Client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations ||| earnings,op_costs,products_services Positive Confident

I mean we listed out the headwinds ||| Neutral Confident

It's not so much for the Media business ||| Neutral

Similarly, as we consider the recent record sales results, many of the sales we have closed over the course of this fiscal year will not begin to have an impact on reported revenues until late fiscal 2018, 2019, and in some cases, even 2020. The growth in revenue attributed to Net New Business was offset by negative 2 points of internal growth ||| sales Positive Confident

We expect issuance growth to improve in the fourth quarter and in 2018. Importantly, we recently re-signed BMO, our largest AIR MILES sponsor, to a multi-year contract ||| sales Positive Confident

So we see many tuck-in opportunities out there ||| Positive Confident

With that, let me turn it back to Dave ||| Neutral

Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see a normal sequential revenue decline for seasonality, perhaps a bit more pronounced in the recent years due to the particularly strong media performance this past quarter ||| sales Positive Confident

Q2 is always a tough quarter for us to understand exactly how it's going to play out given the seasonality of our business ||| sales Negative Confident

Many companies never get beyond that first act ||| Neutral

Hi, David ||| Neutral

com business ||| Neutral

But we do expect some growth in the hyperscale data -- enterprise in general, including hyperscale data centers ||| sales Positive Confident

And I think starting off with the fact that we've increased our innovation spend from around $150 million to around $450 million, I think or somewhere thereabouts in that neighborhood, so it's a significant amount of increase in our R&D investment ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

And so PBMs themselves weren't mentioned specifically, and we did discuss channel partners broadly, but more as an educational point ||| products_services Positive Confident

The improvement in SG&A to sales ratios both on a reported and normalized basis is driven by the mix effect from the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, as well as benefits from Project Renewal savings and transaction-related synergies, which more than offset the impact of incremental advertising and promotion investment in the quarter ||| op_costs Positive

We also understand exactly what is held by the wholesalers because of our contracts with them and the triangulation between how much has been sold from wholesalers to end users minus the demand leaves us with a number which we then extrapolate as being the end-user inventory ||| Neutral Confident

And then, for cloud ||| Neutral

And then of course, working against this is the headwind of shipping and fulfillment ||| Negative

Well and on the sensors, sensors actually  we all know that, thats running single-digit as we continue to invest ahead of the range that we have ahead of us that will begin in 2018. So we do think that, that will be a lever over time as those programs ramp, but we saw a significant investment in those programs ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

For the full year of 2017, we expect high-single-digit organic growth in auto on approximately 3% production growth, but clearly that 3% production growth was driven by the stronger production growth in the first half that we talked about in prior calls ||| products_services,organic_expansion Positive Confident

revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $369 million, growing 18% year-over-year and was the driver of delivering to the high end of our guidance in the quarter ||| sales Positive Confident

So our forecasting method has remained constant ||| op_costs Positive Confident

In Asia, we continue to see strong economic growth in India and several of the ASEAN countries ||| sales Positive Confident

And, Mark, maybe just to finish off the comment, I think, to your question, I think, we feel pretty good about our cost structure ||| op_costs Neutral Uncertain

Geographically, Asia, driven by China, continue to lead regional growth ||| op_costs Positive Confident

Yes, Chris ||| Neutral

Our Events business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017 and Consulting delivered another quarter of growth following a very strong year-ago quarter ||| sales Positive Confident

We cant control that ||| Neutral

This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth through both new and existing enterprises ||| sales Positive Confident

We anticipate Q2 earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.50 to $1.70. The midpoint of this guidance represents quarterly revenue and EPS growth of approximately 31% and 28% respectively year-over-year ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

We normally see the seasonality going from Q4 to Q1 that sales go down ||| sales Neutral

I would not anticipate changing that guide ||| Neutral

So, that continues to be strong as well ||| Neutral

growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven primarily by increased demand for Transderm Scop due to a temporary supply disruption in an alternate product during the quarter ||| products_services Positive Confident

This year I think is going to be a critical year for us as we get back to stability and growth probably in the latter half of the year ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

For the fourth quarter, growth in BD Medical in the U.S ||| earnings Positive Confident

And we have certainly done that over fiscal year 2016 and 2017. First and foremost is growth ||| Neutral

So really not much to comment there ||| Neutral

And again, the target that we've talked about, ranging up to $50 million, we're working very diligently to be in a place where we can harvest as much of that in 2018. That said, given when contracts run through or the timing of when we can reduce or eliminate certain costs may roll into 2018. So think of that more on a run rate basis or an annualized basis as opposed to all coming through in 2018. That said, we're going to do our best to harvest as much of that as possible in 2018. ||| op_costs Neutral Uncertain

And I just think we continue to demonstrate it and we feel very good about the program ramps will continue to allow us to have that type of separation even as global production stays at a low-single-digit to flat environment that we're in ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Third, we feel very good about our transition into warehouse and out of DSD, which is nearly complete ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

But it was a reasonably meaningful contributor to growth in Q4, in particular, our Performance and Security portfolio ||| sales Neutral

I am sticking with it being about a point ||| Neutral

So those are really the key drivers of growth, both from a constant currency and a reported standpoint and then of course currency is helping us from a reported standpoint ||| sales Positive Confident

We augmented not only with third-party design houses but also our own people in our R&D centers in India ||| Neutral Confident

I think this is probably our best quarter ever ||| Neutral

Our Events business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017, and the adjustments we are making in Consulting should position us strongly for the future ||| sales Positive Confident

As such, we expect CapEx spending to return to our long-term model range of 16% to 18% of revenue in 2017. And with the increasing CapEx, you will also see an uptick in depreciation levels throughout 2017. In closing, Akamai accomplished a great deal in 2016, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

Relative to our prior view 90 days ago, we are raising our organic growth expectations for 2017 by 100 basis points and raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, with better operational performance more than offsetting the headwinds from the strengthening dollar that Heath highlighted ||| sales,organic_expansion,op_risks Positive Confident

I'm excited about the modem business ||| Neutral

And as you can imagine, now our average productivity per sales rep is down, but largely driven by ACA ||| sales,products_services Negative

We hope it will be at some point in the near future, but the international business, good, solid performance and really good margin performance as well where that business  10, 15 years ago, my predecessor, we struggled for years to really get that business to perform as well as the rest of ADP from a margin and "retention standpoint," and I think we're kind of there now ||| sales,earnings Neutral Uncertain

I spent time with a number of our customers there a few weeks ago, and I continue to be energized by the long-term prospects for this important end market and the incredible opportunities we have to continue to gain share ||| products_services Positive Confident

revenue growth in the quarter includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure from the fiscal 2017 disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were substantially offset by the benefits from foreign currency ||| sales Positive Confident

That was  we were very proud of that at the time and we're proud to continue ||| earnings Positive Confident

We expect full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be up between 1% and 2% in constant currency with EPS down in the first half reflecting lower sales and the phasing of our cost savings initiatives and brand investments ||| earnings Negative Confident

And so just see that and thats, when we talk about feeling well positioned or profitable growth in 2017 and beyond its because what we're seeing right now are things that we clearly see here and now and we've got a ton of things that we think we can monetize and fully intend to go due, but lets model them in more in the 2018 timeframes adhere and so not much is built into that ||| sales,earnings Positive Uncertain

The reacceleration of product revenue growth remains our number one priority, and we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on this over the coming periods ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

We are confident we can manage the company within our 37% to 39% EBITDA model, while we may go through some quarters where EBITDA margins fall slightly below these levels, possibly even in the second half of 2017. As I've said in the past, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins within our stated ranges is heavily dependent on revenue volumes, possible M&A and needed investments in the business ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion,acquisitions Neutral

Well, strong euro ||| Neutral

That's really the metric we've been focusing on ||| Neutral

In fact, I think it really sets us up for a great 2018 for STAR WARS ||| sales Positive Confident

Look, we talked about this earlier ||| Neutral

But I'd say more of the growth to date has come from penetration into the installed base ||| organic_expansion Neutral

Similarly, if the growth is less in the following  in the next quarter sequentially, you're actually going to see a little bit of a reduction in free cash flow ||| sales Positive Confident

On the M&A front because you got two questions in there in a very subtle way ||| acquisitions Neutral

That will be our top priority ||| Neutral

We're in discussions with all of them ||| Neutral

Remember this isn't necessarily us raising prices ||| Neutral

Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone ||| Neutral

The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens ||| sales Positive Confident

Following two consecutive quarters of record adjusted earnings per share and strong orders in the first quarter, we expect our second quarter adjusted EPS to also be a quarterly record and our guidance represents a strong first half of fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid single-digits organically and low single-digits on a recorded basis due to the impact of the dollar ||| earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident

Indeed, a couple of months ago, when we upped the midpoint of our guidance to $7.40, we thought that we were being reasonably aggressive with our forecast and we certainly didn't expect that we would be raising it anytime soon ||| earnings Neutral

We have very strong hardware business ||| Neutral

This number is up from $65 million last quarter ||| Neutral

During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of stock for $38 million under that April 2014 repurchase plan ||| earnings Positive Confident

But I think it's a sign of, I think, optimism on the part of the sales force that there is really no issue with the economy or with our products or competitively or with pricing that it's really just unfortunately a mathematical issue that got aggravated by some of this uncertainty that came out of Washington, which really stop people from buying not only  or slowed the sales of ACA to a much lower level than we had planned, but I think just created some kind of short-term uncertainty after November ||| sales,products_services Neutral Uncertain

So, I continue to believe those two will be very attractive growth areas over the next five to ten years ||| sales Positive Confident

And when we use the phrase marketing behind our brands we're referring to investments that engage the consumer with our brands ||| products_services Positive Confident

revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $5.6 billion, up 20% sequentially and driven by primarily stronger DRAM ASPs and higher NAND bit volumes ||| sales Positive Confident

In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track ||| sales Positive Confident

In Q1, Creative Cloud ARR growth was driven by strong performance in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud teams offering and international growth, as well as strong retention of existing subscribers ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

From a product offering perspective, entry equipment sales were down 9.8% or 8.6% in constant currency, reflecting a higher mix of lower-value products as the strongest activity was in the developing markets and in the lower A4 product classes, as well as continued high OEM equipment declines ||| products_services Positive Confident

Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from the same period last year and within our guidance range ||| sales,earnings Neutral

And in the cloud space, we experienced good sequential bit growth ||| sales Positive Confident

We see plenty of momentum, innovation, and opportunity for us to capture in both the near and long-term and are aggressively pursuing profitable share and targeting strategic growth segments ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

Now let me shift to a couple of the tailwinds ||| Neutral Confident

It wasn't like an XP refresh cycle ||| Neutral

Metallics, florals and patents and dressy silhouettes were also well received ||| Positive

And our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 33.4% ||| Neutral

Our second half outlook is up sequentially, expecting 20% profit growth for full-year 2017. We're rebalancing the portfolio to faster growth businesses; NexTraq out, Cambridge in; we're strengthening our capital base, returning capital to shareholders, still increasing our liquidity and still maintaining a less-than-three-times leverage ratio ||| sales,earnings,debt Positive Confident

And we have not been asked to do any additional clinical endpoints or device-related studies at this juncture ||| Neutral Confident

Now, for an update on retail fuel, in the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.172 compared to $0.169 in the same quarter last year ||| op_costs Negative Confident

So hopefully, that will translate into an interest in our new offerings which gives them a cost advantage so that's why we talk a lot about the Intuvo GC and what it might do in this segment ||| products_services Neutral Confident

As you know, there's a wide distribution of rate ||| Neutral Confident

So I still feel like that's going to be roughly about where it goes down, and then the cloud will continue to grow at that rate plus additional as more of the growth goes into the cloud ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

You've got to have great products ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

That said, we are expecting profitable organic sales growth to ramp up as the year progresses, especially in the second half ||| sales Positive Confident

We are still evaluating the impact and estimate it could be as much as $40 million to revenues, with a corresponding impact that could be as much as 1 percentage point of EPS growth ||| earnings Positive Uncertain

That number has started to accelerate over the last couple of quarters and I would expect that as we go into the back half of the year, we'll exit north of 40% growth in SaaS revenue for Q4 as well ||| sales Positive Confident

Interestingly, when we talk about the two programs, Celebrity Revolution and Royal Amplified, really a lot of the thinking that's going into that is really thinking through how our guests spend is changing and you'll start to see that when we bring these ships out of the modernization, the program that we've really reallocated space to generate better revenues in areas that we see guests now naturally gravitating to ||| sales Positive Confident

And the question is always when you have something that grows very fast, is it better from a  both competitive position, growing the value of the Company over time, to push on growth or on profitability ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

I actually think the go-to-market side of the equation  we will make some investments there ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

And I think our win with the veterans this quarter, I think all of us know that nobody delivers better systems and better customer service than our veterans, and thats why were so excited to be able to align with the agency to go to build these next generation systems for them ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for Consulting business, ended the quarter at $91 million, down 1% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis ||| sales Positive Confident

Fortunately, the U.S ||| Neutral

It is ||| Neutral

With our continued progress this quarter, we remain confident that supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of fiscal 2017. Consistent with that, total supplies revenue was down just 2% year-over-year in constant currency ||| sales Positive Confident

So I think David continue to guide ASPs that we're pretty much constant from year to year ||| products_services Positive Uncertain

And so again, I'd look back at the big picture ||| Neutral

I think the teams can return to focusing on our joint business plans, which were in place going into the holidays and Toys "R" Us was performing for us quite well ||| sales Positive

We would tell you the backlog is still strong ||| Neutral

With EPOGEN, we've been executing our lifecycle management strategy by successfully transitioning much of the dialysis business to Aranesp and extending our supply contract with DaVita through 2022. The transition to Aranesp is largely complete and the second quarter year-over-year decline in EPOGEN is primarily due to lower net prices as a result of the DaVita agreement ||| products_services Positive Confident

Every time a new port speed is introduced into the market, as it achieves mass adoption, you will expect, as we would do, that pricing will start to go down and it offsets the benefit that you would get from the traffic growth alone in the market ||| sales Positive Confident

Its a great business, right? All the investment occurs in new equipment ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

And that is an ongoing effort and going well ||| Neutral

Book-to-bill was, it was 1.0. ||| Neutral

Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

I'm a big believer in stores, but I'm also a big believer in digital ||| Neutral Confident

New business bookings this quarter were down 7% ||| Neutral

The only thing, Jeff, that I would add is, whilst we look at the refresh cycle as a growth opportunity for F5, I think we also want to be clear that that is not solely what we see as the medium to long term growth driver for the company ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

Search revenue ex-TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume ||| sales Positive Confident

So thank you for the complex multipart question ||| Neutral

Adobe would not be the Company it is today without our rich diversity of employees, and that continued diversity is vital to our future ||| Neutral

economy just continues its steady growth trajectory; low unemployment, low inflation, healthy consumer confidence, and if you look at our SpendingPulse data, retail sales ex auto were up 3.6%, that's kind of similar to last quarter ||| sales Positive Confident

But yeah, as we talked about, China was a challenge in this market ||| Negative

So as far as we look into 2018, I think your question about was half of that, a good placeholder ||| products_services Positive Uncertain

IP continues its double digit growth and our software quality and security group is scaling to critical mass with excellent revenue expansion ||| sales Positive Confident

If you go back and look over three decades, any time a lot of players either get more competitive, they're already in the game or new entrants come in, everyone leans into the advertising and marketing muscle and that gets more people to raise their head and say, hey, I'm paying hundreds of dollars to go to this service, why don't I try that instead? I think this is going to be net-net good for the category ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

And the Communications area ||| Neutral

The first driver is overall growth in the number of tax returns filed with the IRS ||| sales Positive Confident

In fact, there's not going to be a major shift ||| Neutral

Gross margins were down, as expected, on higher system sales as well as inefficiencies associated with implementing our new ERP system during the quarter ||| sales,earnings Negative

That said, we were obviously pleased with our overall operating margin expansion ||| earnings Positive

So, look, in conclusion again a good Q2, good growth, 26% profit growth, back-to-back quarters of 25%-plus profit growth ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP ||| sales Negative

So, I just  the point is, you need to  as we communicate out externally and you model, you just  you need to just be thoughtful like we're being, in terms of next year it's going to be a little bit higher, certainly, as you think about our OpEx trend ||| products_services Negative Confident

Our total Individual enrollment of approximately 1.8 million members consists of 1.5 million ACA-compliant members and 300,000 non-ACA-compliant members ||| earnings Positive Confident

But it's $5 million to $10 million ||| Neutral

And this new distribution, I do mean  new distribution, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone in new countries, new cities ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

As well as that in the Medicare Advantage area that we've taken the waiver of the fee and we've baked it into product design and benefits to the customer so that the members actually enjoy that ||| Positive Confident

No, it makes sense ||| Neutral

We absolutely believe we're gaining market share in international dental ||| Neutral Confident

We're in several jewelry chains, such as Kay, Zales and Jared, we'll be in Dillard's and JCPenney as well ||| products_services Neutral

Always remember inventory days is a backwards looking metric, so what we have it there for is to support growth ||| sales Positive Confident

The business declined slightly on an organic basis, with growth in automotive applications and industrial applications being offset by softness in the North American heavy truck applications ||| sales,organic_expansion Negative

The size of our basement doesn't have credit and the ability to expand that is very attractive and the risk involving capabilities we have also very attractive, and so there are a lot of economics here to share and we believe that we can significantly reduce our risk exposure, but maintain strong economics for our business ||| op_risks Positive Confident

I would expect it to be increasing over time ||| Neutral

Our SKIPPY business in China performed well while our meat business in China continues to experience high pork raw material prices ||| products_services Neutral Confident

Yeah ||| Neutral

But bear in min, John, that we talked about our bit growth in context of an industry that we were estimating ||| sales Positive Confident

I appreciate that question ||| Neutral

So, we didn't see any market impact from announcements that impacted order ||| Neutral

If it comes down to anything below that, you should expect us as a company to benefit from it directly to the bottom line ||| earnings Negative

Azure revenue increased 93%, up 94% in constant currency, and annuity revenue again grew double digits ||| sales Positive Confident

Throughout the quarter, we saw an opportunity to improve our DIY value perception ||| Positive Confident

The second would be around the discussion point around the revenue growth profile and what it looks like ||| sales Positive Confident

I think we've disclosed in the K, and this is very approximate number because I could caution you again, the application date that we get sometimes is not the most accurate, but in all cutting applications both high-power and mid-power and even some of the QCW is about 50% of total revenue ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

So I think you'll probably  I'm not going to specifically guide for Q2, but as I said beyond the first quarter, which I said 39% to 40%, and I think that it will be 39% to 40% depending upon where our revenue lands in the range ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

This ranking is also representative of our exceptional workplace culture ||| Positive

Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity billings growth and install base expansion ||| products_services,organic_expansion Positive Confident

For recurring fee revenues, we were reaffirming our guidance of 29% to 31% growth ||| sales Positive Confident

These results were driven by U.S ||| earnings Neutral Confident

Hey, Tien-Tsin ||| Neutral

sales ||| sales Neutral

Segment gross margin dollars grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, while segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud sales mix as well as roughly a point of impact from LinkedIn ||| sales,earnings Negative

And then as we've said multiple times in our guidance, our second half of this fiscal year gets back from a margin standpoint, from a growth standpoint, from a bookings standpoint to a more reasonable normalized place, if you will ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

We did get a little bit of help from on the growth rate from the floating come ||| sales Positive Confident

Our objective is to grow better than that ||| Neutral

And so again, the underlying fundamental there is we feel really good about the business, it's connecting with consumers and it's on trend, and we expect to continue to do that ||| products_services Positive Confident

[Indiscernible] being one example of that, Harvard Health Care being another example, but most recently we are doing this deal out in our western region with PeaceHealth and we are working on that with enough capacity to pull that off ||| acquisitions Positive Confident

And so we'll step back and take responsibility of what can we do to continue to accelerate that growth ||| sales Positive Confident

It's working for us based on our rollout plans ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

Let me give you another example ||| Neutral

So that we're going to reduce that business to just those two core business lines of RMF and investment management ||| Neutral

But remember with the HIF coming back in 2018, that's going to impact the MER ||| products_services Neutral Confident

Yes, it was small impact, less than 1 point on the overall growth rate ||| sales Positive Confident

So the answer to your second question is correct ||| Neutral

And the World Bank data, they adjusted their principal growth for last year and our principal growth was in line with what the World Bank showed and then for this year, they expect something just under 4% principal growth ||| sales Positive Confident

Inventories were $32.5 million ||| Neutral

And by the way, when all this rhetoric began, we went back and we took a look at, if you looked at the overall reimbursement rates year-over-year, from 2016 to 2015, okay, in an environment where we've talked about pharmacy margins being under a lot of reimbursement pressures, there are many, many pharmacies to include some specialty pharmacies, in the SilverScript network that their reimbursement rates in 2016 were more favorable than what they were in 2015, largely as the result of the performance network fees and the performance that they demonstrated around that ||| earnings Neutral Confident

GAAP operating income grew by 152% and GAAP operating margins increased by 2,483 bps compared to Q3 last year ||| earnings Neutral

Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $70 million compared to a loss of $66 million a year ago ||| earnings Neutral

If you want to look at our $1.24 compared to our guidance of $1.16 approximately half was driven by the higher sales growth of 8% with the remainder driven by taxes and a little bit of currency ||| sales Positive Confident

With this backdrop, we're kind of pleased with the growth we're seeing across our business ||| sales Positive Confident

Perhaps more importantly, the underlining drivers of our revenue growth saw continued strong performance throughout 2016. We ended the year with $197 million active customer accounts, adding 5.4 million new accounts in Q4, our highest organic total in two years ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

We had strong growth in Q4 in all of our target industries ||| sales Positive Confident

And to explain again, why it's so important is the optical sensor allows us to have real-time sensing of the location of the Impella pump relative to where it is against the aortic valve; is it above or below, is it in the left ventricle or above the aortic valve ||| products_services Positive Confident

Were finding a way to get to win-win solution ||| Positive Confident

What we also like to as you look forward in terms of our diagnostics business, which is on the molecular side and also the cytology side and then you've got an imaging side ||| products_services Positive Confident

And so we are evaluating that right now ||| Neutral

I think the rollout is -- we can only handle so many different projects in any one given year, while there is an expense associated with it, thats not the reason why we arent rolling them out quicker ||| products_services Negative Uncertain

Hey, Michael ||| Neutral

For the full-year, we now expect organic sales to be down 1% to 2%, which is a 100 basis points better than our original guidance ||| sales Negative Confident

In 2016, we saw improved momentum in total contract value, delivering 14% CV growth and our client and wallet retention metrics are near all-time highs ||| sales Positive Confident

But lets see what the future brings ||| Neutral

We had good bio-security to begin with, but we amped it up to an all-time high level of discipline and scrutiny, frankly, and it hasn't stopped ||| op_risks Positive Confident

Do I believe that there will be continued momentum? Yes, we have, in our long-term model for this company's growth, been counting on and have provided you with color on where we see our switching business to come in ||| sales Positive Confident

First quarter revenue increased 18% from a year ago to $984 million based on growth across both of our business segments ||| sales Neutral

In Luxury, the Marc Jacobs Daisy Anniversary digital campaign reached 2.8 million young women with engagement rates in the mid-teens percentage in high target cost per view ||| products_services Positive Confident

So, I think to your point, we did on the Q1 call, we did think that revenues would stabilize ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

Our non-U.S ||| Neutral

The math is not working for overall growth ||| sales Positive Confident

The GMV growth was excellent ||| sales Positive Confident

Those are the best opportunities that we have ahead of us because of the constant growth of semiconductors in those spaces ||| sales Positive Confident

You may also recall that we had plans for a lower output and marginally lower cost NovaSeq system, the 5000, to run just the S1 and S2 flow cells ||| op_costs Negative Confident

So that's a contributor to growth in the first half, and as Brian said, the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year, but given the product we have, we feel relatively good about where we are ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

It's a very small part of our business ||| Neutral

What happens when shipments level off or if they in one quarter might go down a little bit, then revenue will catch up ||| sales Negative

This is a temporary issue as our teams are fully engaged to ensure our customers are not impacted by these supply dynamics, and we expect this to be fully remedied in early fiscal 2018. So let's talk about the Industrial Solutions segment, so I'd appreciate if you could turn to slide 6. Growth momentum in the Industrial Solutions segment continued with 5% organic growth year-over-year in the quarter ||| sales,organic_expansion Negative Uncertain

The team once again drove revenue growth year-over-year and market share expansion ||| sales Positive Confident

But as you can imagine with new products, it's going to take a fair amount of time to actually fully penetrate them at installed base ||| products_services Neutral

I think the last time, we cited something like this was probably back with Wilma and Rita where we actually talked about it in the call ||| Neutral

Thank you, Kash ||| Neutral

Overall, strategic products were up 22% year-on-year, so we saw really strong growth ||| products_services Positive Confident

So I don't know that I see a greater acceleration ||| Neutral Uncertain

Enterprise Services revenue should decline again due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 service agreements ||| sales,products_services Negative

But since that doesn't appear to be the environment that we're entering at least for now, we feel that we're going to rely on this historical data and I think plan on returning to historical growth rates in our new business, and our new business bookings ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

The locations of our growth, the aggregate growth and our performance in the first quarter is about where we expected it to be as well ||| earnings Positive Confident

So you're referring to the 11 points of QuickBooks Online growth that we got from TurboTax Self-Employed, sending customers over ||| sales Positive Confident

Net new units grew 6% in 2016 and we expect continued growth as the development agreements signed last year take hold ||| sales Positive Confident

As we stated in our fourth quarter call, we are monitoring developments closely in the first half of 2017, as we evaluate our longer-term strategy in the individual marketplace ||| earnings Neutral Confident

It isn't a net new market that we serve ||| Neutral

Okay, lets see ||| Neutral

I think digital kind of followed exactly what Kevin talked about ||| Neutral

We believe we've done enough analytics around market checks that we believe it's a very credible expectation, and we are holding firm on how we believe we're going to be looking at our performance for the balance in the term of agreement as well as January 1, 2010 and beyond ||| earnings Positive Confident

Let me tackle it ||| Neutral

It's not like we have a date certain that we're going to shift from A to B ||| Neutral Uncertain

So the power that that business is going to have now, the focus  and to focus on the competition and to focus on execution and NPS scores and retention is going to be, I think, equal to what we've done in the downmarket on RUN, and that gets me excited ||| competition Neutral Uncertain

So, the reason we're saying it's tracking after prior cycle is really a key metric for iSeries is the adoption of the product in the customer base as in do our customers see good reasons to adopt this new platform and refresh their environment? And the best way for us to measure that is to look at the percentage of our total appliance sales that come from this new platform ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

The year-over-year margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and technology efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher compensation-related spends and higher bank fees in U.S ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

We have a 65 share ||| Neutral

And I'm also not going to disclose how much it is ||| Neutral

In effect, we have won the perception war ||| Neutral

Sure ||| Neutral

New products drove broad growth across the Raymarine business, which was partially offset by weakness in thermal cameras due to increased customer vetting processes ||| products_services Positive Confident

We see a very good third quarter underway ||| sales Positive Confident

We're number one in the marketplace ||| Neutral

This growth is highlighted by continued ramping of our Power Tools business, including our newly launched System 8, as well as good performances of our Sterishield and waste management products ||| earnings Positive Confident

So our investments are much more weighted, I would say, on R&D innovation, to be frank ||| organic_expansion Neutral

We anticipate additional expense driven by advancing our Alzheimer's programs, notably, aducanumab and the BACE inhibitor; as well as the desire to build our pipeline to business development ||| op_costs Negative Confident

Inclusive of these two large products, our capital expense guidance is for $75 million to $80 million in 2017. Putting this together equates to free cash flow of $348 million to $373 million in 2017 or flat to 7% growth over 2016. Normalizing for the two major projects I just mentioned, free cash flow would be increasing by between 7% and 14% ||| op_costs,products_services Positive Confident

It is certainly true for software for a long time ||| Neutral

And we are completely aligned on the strategy ||| Neutral

Before I guide with the detailed review of the fourth quarter, I would like to highlight some of our key accomplishments for the full year ||| Positive

Yeah, it was very strong, but we expect  what we said historically is that, we do expect  even when we wrap the acquisitions in the beginning of the third quarter, we still expect to see incremental gross margin improvement quarter-after-quarter or year-over-year, improvement in each quarter ||| earnings Positive Confident

Our auto sales were up 13% organically in the quarter, well ahead of auto production growth of 5% due to increased content from the secular trends we talked to you about around safe, green and connected, coupled with our very strong global leadership position ||| products_services,organic_expansion Positive Confident

Operator, please? Question-and-Answer Session ||| Neutral Confident

As Heath mentioned, we've established levers to drive earnings growth and continue to perform well against our business model, and this year's results represent best-in-class performance with 7% organic growth, expanded operating margins and 20% adjusted EPS growth that these results truly demonstrate the execution along all the levers we have in our business model ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident

I won't break out the hyper-converged ||| Neutral

We've got two great leaders running both product and engineering, and we've recently gone through a unification from an org model standpoint to bring together all of our product and engineering efforts ||| products_services Positive Confident

So you combine those two things together and you got to say that is a good signal ||| Positive

This is David, and thank you for the question here ||| Neutral

In Q1, we introduced the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction in certain country markets in Canada, EMEA and APAC ||| products_services Positive Confident

On free cash flow, it grew 4% on a trailing 12-month basis, and that is compared to a higher number for revenue on the same basis ||| sales Positive Confident

We are executing a lot better here ||| Neutral

It was a couple basis points at most ||| Neutral

So, I think that as we go the forward on Rogue One, I'm sure that there'll be even more engagement in that story as more and more kids catch on to the story ||| Neutral

While we delivered year-over-year growth of 4% and strong profitability in the third quarter, our product revenue performance fell short of our expectations ||| sales,earnings,products_services Positive Confident

For modeling and comparability purposes, we are also providing historical revenues, adjusted revenues and contribution margin for the combined company in our full reportable segments for the four quarters of 2016, as well as Q1 2017. This information along with an in-depth overview of our Q2 performance is available in the two documents we have furnished to accompany this call, both located on our Investor Relations website ||| sales,earnings Neutral

Everyone wants to spend money before we have to ||| Positive Confident

Turning to slide 8. Adjusted operating income rose 22% to $134 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. That growth was driven by the acquisition of NACC, organic recurring fee revenue growth, and the impact of higher event-driven revenues ||| sales,organic_expansion,acquisitions Positive Confident

Yes, let me take that one ||| Neutral

First as I mentioned, weve go some currency pressure coming our way ||| Negative

There is some FX impact ||| Neutral

I think it was a point or point and half negative ||| Neutral

So we're in that 1.5% to 2% range ||| Neutral

Turning to our cash flow guidance, similar to GAAP EPS, our 2017 operating cash flow is expected to be significantly impacted by charges related to the CEB acquisition as well as incremental interest expense ||| op_costs,acquisitions Negative

Now, moving to Q3 supplies performance ||| Neutral

Hey, Matthew, I'd just tell you it's gone and is going very well ||| Positive Confident

I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg ||| Neutral

Device revenue growth this quarter was consistent with the market, and overall patient volume growth is steady ||| earnings Positive Confident

And there's a bit more momentum there ||| Neutral

You make it very simple if you make a transaction ||| Neutral

We're on track to our plan since our last update ||| Positive Confident

Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of just under $2 million on a year-over-year basis and a $6 million impact on a sequential basis as the dollar strengthened significantly through the quarter ||| sales Neutral

They have a working relationship as you know with Med Express ||| products_services Positive Confident

Yeah, just a couple things ||| Neutral Confident

This level of innovation can only come from talented, creative and dedicated employees ||| Neutral

We're doing, I would say, okay ||| Neutral

Sure, Brian, I'll keep it short ||| Neutral

In February, Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2017 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs research report ||| Neutral

But we don't even want to have that problem, so we're going to eliminate that here in Q4. And then as we go throughout 2018, we'll be completely supply unconstrained and be able to meet every piece of demand for the N20 and F20. And as I said earlier, we're really excited about the technology InfinitySeal and broad fit range and its capability to get to patients there ||| products_services Positive Confident

We've had a strong first half of the year ||| Neutral

Acquisitions, primarily L2 and SCM World had a slightly less than 2 point impact on the traditional Gartner Research adjusted revenue growth for the quarter ||| sales,acquisitions Positive Confident

So first, regarding the inventory, Wendy ||| Neutral

In total, depending on the mix of share repurchase, dividends and M&A, we would expect to have between $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital in 2017. It's important to emphasize here that we have a disciplined approach and a strong track record of deploying capital and avoid having surplus capital sit idle for any length of time ||| earnings Positive Confident

But I think it's premature ||| Neutral

Moving on, post sale revenue was down 5.7% or 3.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with Q1.

In Q2, Managed Document Services was 32% of our revenues and was down 6% in actual currency and 3.9% in constant currency, with $32 million of the $34 million decline driven by lower equipment sales reflecting the timing of the new product launch, which gets amplified in MDS, given the longer sales cycles and the natural lag for realizing signings and subsequent installation of the equipment ||| sales,products_services Negative

That's the guidance we gave ||| Neutral

Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect Media growth rates to continue to moderate from Q1 levels and within Americas gaming vertical, most notably ||| sales Positive Confident

Trac will discuss the financials in more detail ||| Neutral

The transformation of NetApp is yielding solid results with the return to top line growth and increasing profitability ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

We laid out a game plan ||| Neutral

Home prices are up year-over-year over 5%, housing turnover over 4% and aging and housing stock, household formation ||| sales Neutral

I want to just add to that ||| Neutral

So a good performance overall, but as Tim mentioned 3PAR performance was soft due to I think a very tough competitive environment in the  in the mid-range and then some sales challenges in the United States ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular, but it's sort of acknowledging the environment that we're in and, at the same time, recognizing that we're in phenomenally good capital shape, and so we want to be poised if something appears to us to be an opportunity ||| Positive Confident

Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity, with both new and existing client enterprises ||| sales Positive Confident

Payments are rapidly digitizing ||| Neutral

Turning to the business performance, while we have seen some improvement in the market overall, our strong Q3 performance was driven primarily by better execution and a compelling portfolio resulting in solid growth across key businesses ||| sales Positive Confident

Comps for U.S ||| Neutral

So, cash flow, as we talked about at the year-end earnings call, it's really the same thoughts or similar thoughts that  both 2017 and 2018 would be below what we would think our normalized cash flow would be, about $1 billion ||| earnings Neutral Uncertain

So we are taking action ||| Neutral

As we communicated previously, we continue to expect our bookings growth to gradually expand back to pre-ACA growth levels as we progress through the year ||| sales Positive Confident

And there is a concerted effort right now in the company to optimize our products for cost of goods sold in a way that will help gross margins ||| sales,earnings,op_costs,products_services Positive Confident

We're always going to continue to try to reduce the cost structure over time ||| op_costs Positive Confident

Therefore, I believe having a combination with an SGLT2 with by far the market leader in the DPP-4 class will be a competitive advantage for us ||| competition Positive Confident

Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 14.6% reflects a larger-than-anticipated benefit related to the adoption of the changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses as well as benefits in geographic income mix ||| earnings Positive Confident

We saw year-over-year share gains ||| Neutral

Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 7.4%, or 5.7% in constant currency ||| sales Negative

Pretty incredible progress ||| Neutral

Canada had them ||| Neutral

We also expect the softness in international dental equipment sales to continue in Q1 as we approach the IDS trade show, which is in late March, and anticipate an acceleration of equipment sales thereafter ||| sales Positive Confident

So let's talk about this ||| Neutral

And we need to get that under our belt and get some momentum on the develop  we have momentum, we need to get more momentum, we need to get some opened ||| Neutral

Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $824 million, approximately flat year-over-year due to lower semi-custom SoC sales, partially offset by IP-related revenue ||| sales Neutral

Not just down, negative, substantially ||| Neutral

And as we get further into the cycle, our expectation is to continue to see product revenue growth ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

This was our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth ||| sales Positive Confident

I think the competitiveness of the product portfolio, the fact that we enable our channel partners to have a rich base of margin-rich services associated with the business that they're doing with NetApp continues to make us a compelling value proposition to our partners ||| sales,earnings,products_services Neutral Uncertain

Let me start ||| Neutral

I'd also ask as you think about adjusted operating margins, please keep in mind that we're currently running in the mid-16% range, and that the first quarter 2017 had an unusually high operating margin level that we covered in detail back in the first quarter call ||| sales,earnings Positive Uncertain

The continued adoption of our iSeries products, accelerating sales of software solutions and F5's growing relevance in cloud environments, all serve as a foundation for continued product revenue growth ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

Operator? Question-and-Answer Session ||| Neutral

I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results ||| earnings Neutral Confident

Yes, that makes sense ||| Neutral

And I think maybe, I should have also mentioned, when you think about seeing that type of performance and Satya mentioned it is not just because of work done this quarter, it is a great point, but its also the investments weve made ||| organic_expansion Positive Uncertain

We're very pleased with our results to-date, and we are on track to deliver our target $600 million of gross savings in 2017. This is an important element of our strategy to drive both expanding margins and to support investments to improve our revenue trajectory ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident

From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 45% to $1.56 billion from a year earlier, and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $332 million ||| sales Positive Confident

Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margin was 24.4% compared to 22.9% in the first quarter ||| earnings Positive Confident

Our Tegra gaming platform also did extremely well ||| Neutral

I think two things there ||| Neutral

Yeah ||| Neutral

The diluted earnings per share calculation for the third quarter of 2017 was based on 1.143 million shares, which includes 100.6 million shares related to our 2026 convertible notes ||| earnings Neutral

These cost savings more than offset inflation which rounded down to 1% for the full year and help to drive strong margin expansion ||| op_costs Positive Confident

Our objective obviously is better connect with our customers through more personalize messaging, care of their specific needs and we continue to build capabilities to do that ||| Neutral

Jude and we did it within six months and as you know organized in integrated business units that I'd say organization is still kind of setting, the glue is still kind of setting, but we move to within six months that might have been aggressive but the organization is very stable ||| op_costs Positive Confident

I'll summarize the financial performance and discuss some of the key business drivers ||| earnings Positive Confident

Yeah ||| Neutral

It also depends on whether the -- the holders are willing to sell ||| op_costs Neutral Uncertain

So we've been very consistent and we track it ||| Neutral Confident

At the midpoint, this equates to revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year ||| sales Neutral

We continue to see the cohorts of QBO or non-U.S ||| Neutral

I think longer term you should think about the segment margins staying around mid teens, depending upon where the businesses are, but that's where I think you can think about it, but a lot of that margin improvement was structural impact that we've been driving over the past three years that we've talked to you all about ||| sales,earnings Neutral Uncertain

Next, to GTO ||| Neutral

During the several weeks of the storms, Caribbean bookings dropped precipitously, both for the hurricane period and for the period beyond ||| sales Negative

I'll start by commenting on the unusual set of hurricanes we experienced this summer ||| Negative

In terms of disclosure, I would say at this point well it's  we're seeing good growth, still good growth off a small base and it's having a bigger effect obviously on subs and it is on ARR as that becomes material or we think it's clouding the results and making it too difficult to model that's will consider breaking it out ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

It's probably in the $0.05 range ||| Neutral

Second is we continue to work with them on what we do with clients around data and population health and if you think about what we're doing with our professional laboratory services business, we're calling on the same people that are trying to become more efficient and better in delivering integrated delivery system and so that areas is promising as well; so often good start, doing what we said what we would do and the relationship will only get stronger overtime ||| products_services Positive Confident

And Heath, I'll let you talk about taxes ||| Neutral

You can tell me if I didn't ||| Neutral

Excluding Airwave, revenue grew 3% ||| sales Positive Confident

This is an increase of 277 or 12% from a year ago, and we continue to plan for approximately 13% sales head count growth for the traditional Gartner business in 2017. The acquisition of CEB adds more than 500 quota-bearing research sales associates ||| sales,acquisitions Positive Confident

Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book ||| sales Negative

Premiere Pro was the official editing tool of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in January ||| Neutral

The quickest way to answer that is just look at the mix from Q2. Just about 85% of the mix was coming from new customers or maybe existing customers with new use cases ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

OEM non-Pro revenue declined 1%, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from the Windows Premium device category ||| sales Negative

We launched this a couple of years ago with the [indiscernible], we call it Quanum ||| products_services Neutral Confident

So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens ||| sales Neutral

Thank you, Jesse ||| Neutral

Maybe, Devinder, do you want to add to that? ||| Neutral

We remain humble and focused ||| Neutral

Thank you ||| Neutral

In addition to the large contract Gary mentioned, our corporate liquidity solutions had strong license revenue, contributing to the growth ||| sales Positive Confident

So it certainly helps ||| Neutral

So overall, we continue to feel good about cash flow and are maintaining our full-year guidance of $700 million to $900 million in operating cash flow from continuing services ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Thank you, Franois ||| Neutral

I dont think there is an inventory issue certainly, if you actually take a look at inventory levels that are reported, which are typically financial numbers and adjust those for dollar cost of how pricing has changed over the course of the year ||| op_costs Neutral Uncertain

It may go up or down a point or two based upon choices we make, but that's a very good healthy margin for a business that's in good growth but also continuing to deliver the kind of rigor we want on the bottom line ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

The multitude of launches that we had in reinvent was great for all sizes of customers, really, both large and small; both companies starting  just getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years ||| Positive

It's a great question related to our engagement in the market with our provider community ||| products_services Positive Confident

Our digital channels, including website and mobile bookings continue to outpace other channels on share growth, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year ||| products_services Positive

So you can  now you can assume that that trend is normally unit price driven, that's the most significant driver of it on a year-over-year basis ||| sales Positive Uncertain

So, we'll see where we ultimately end up, but we like the strong margins we're getting this year and we want to continue to drive a good balance between investing and also driving good profitability ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

It can lead to some good volume growth, but what I also visualize over time is the choice coming across to a consumer at the point-of-sale on their phone or from the terminal, whichever way, a choice to make payments from these alternative funding sources ||| sales Positive Confident

That's basically what's going on ||| Neutral

And we're starting to get some traction on the margin improvements ||| earnings Positive

I have said before that these kind of undertakings, driving, accelerated deployment of new technology nodes into volume production and continuing to narrow the gap on the cost front is a multiyear phenomena and we have made very good progress in this regard ||| op_costs,products_services Positive Confident

Yeah, wireless being Meraki, yes ||| Neutral

Then we had timing factors ||| Neutral Confident

So, we cant ||| Neutral

Let me get into the order trends ||| Neutral

I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10% ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

And that is built on Heroku ||| Neutral

We estimate that that additional comp day added approximately 60 basis points to same-store sales in the fourth quarter ||| sales Positive

Yes, I'll take that ||| Neutral

First, in order to align our internal operations and how we talk about the business we have started reporting B2C and C2C growth and we will no longer report fixed price and auction format growth however we will continue to provide the format split on our website ||| Neutral

growth by approximately 200 basis points ||| earnings Positive Confident

It wasn't predictable before ||| Neutral

I would think international is a big opportunity, because only $50 million of their business is international today ||| organic_expansion Neutral Confident

So Andrew, we'll start with the year ||| Neutral

revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 21% and 23% in constant currency to $8.4 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

This is Mike, I'll take those take questions ||| Neutral Confident

To forge stronger customer connections that lead to brand loyalty and growth, forward-looking enterprises are reimagining the experience they provide to their customers ||| products_services Neutral

Yes, so let me take some of that, maybe I'll start, Dave you want to add ||| Neutral

We have to make sure we have enough people to open these restaurants and open them strongly and doing a great job with it ||| organic_expansion Neutral

Chris, I think the only thing I'd really add was more  and some of that caution might have also been around the corporate multi-unit because at the time, we had been slowing in that area ||| op_risks Negative Uncertain

In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 4.8% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $846 million, a 15.2% increase compared to the prior year ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident

I think what you're going to see is that this step-up in investment is that our head count ramp is probably going to be more similar to what it's been historically than it was this past year, and as I mentioned it's going to be targeted but very heavily focused in new product innovation ||| products_services,organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

Now, let me turn to segment performance ||| Neutral

We do tend to be the higher priced competitor ||| Neutral

Sure, Kash ||| Neutral

Many have not been successful ||| Neutral

back in the 2013, 2014, 2015 timeframe ||| Neutral

And have a happy holiday season ||| Neutral

organic sales were negatively impacted by the aforementioned Sage product action and weather-related matters by 320 basis points ||| sales Negative Confident

Inside the store, monetize the footsteps ||| Neutral

So we knew thats a net-net opportunity ||| Neutral

However, given that the CEB transaction closed only a month ago, please note that our GAAP estimates are likely to be subject to change as we complete purchase accounting and further refine our estimates for other GAAP-related expenses ||| op_costs Positive Confident

Right, I would say actually we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency, 7% before LinkedIn ||| sales Positive Confident

Not at all, not at all, that our balance sheet has a lot of firepower to do M&A, to do CapEx purchases and to do our share buyback ||| organic_expansion,acquisitions Neutral

As I just said in some of the Q&A, the secular growth opportunity in our business remains very strong ||| sales Positive Confident

What was the second part of your question? ||| Neutral

We opened 100 net new stores and continue to deliver very healthy new store productivity ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

So you've captured it quite well ||| Neutral

Thanks, Lisa ||| Neutral

Robby, I would be in Rodney's boat from an insight standpoint ||| Neutral

Adjusted sales grew 3% while adjusted volume grew 2% ||| sales Positive Confident

So, we have plenty of runway to grow ||| Positive

It's continuing to climb ||| Neutral

And in the third quarter, Frito-Lay on a standalone basis was once again the number one contributor to total U.S ||| products_services Positive Confident

Many of our HiSeq X customers have ordered their first NovaSeqs to start validations in new projects ||| products_services Positive Confident

Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% ||| Neutral

And our recent SOASTA acquisition, which closed in early April, is a good example of extending our market-leading Web acceleration offerings into the natural adjacency of Digital Performance Management focusing on cloud application monitoring and testing and aligning performance to business value ||| acquisitions Neutral

So that's how you get to approximately 20% ||| Neutral

In-store, our appliance suits allow customers to visualize how their appliance purchase will look in their refreshed or remodeled kitchen ||| products_services Positive

I am pleased with our first quarter product execution and improved year-over-year financial results, which demonstrate the revenue growth and gross margin expansion potential with our strong set of new products ||| sales,earnings,products_services Positive Confident

And I think that given the nature of the adjacent areas, I think that they have significant opportunities for EBITDA that's more like our Performance and Security EBITDA ||| earnings Neutral Uncertain

We had a couple of promotions going ||| Neutral

We've also added Davivienda in Columbia ||| Neutral

So I think that's the way I would probably think about the growth going into next year just sitting here today ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

And that is going to continue to be a big growth driver for the company in the year and longer term ||| sales Positive Confident

Compared to last year, our deferred sales grew by $116 million ||| sales Neutral

The contribution from Net New Business reflects the strong GTO sales results over the last couple of years, including some sales closed in fiscal year 2015. This meaningful lag between sales and revenue recognition highlights the number of larger deals we have been closing ||| sales Positive Confident

And we grew net revenue by 4% year over year to $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth in Personal Systems ||| sales Positive Confident

So it's all positive ||| Neutral

Transactions grew 2% led by strong growth in westernunion ||| sales Positive Confident

Now that's a longer-term trend ||| Neutral

It can continue to go down in the current environment, as we continue to work through tax planning strategies, and as our international revenue base continues to grow ||| sales Negative

In fact, I talked about double-digit growth, so we felt very, very good about that ||| sales Positive Confident

It's a great business and it's a good-sized revenue business fortunately it's around breakeven is the way we would describe it ||| sales Positive Confident

Before I get into the revenue details, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency ||| sales Positive Confident

I think we will be continuing to ramp Zen-based product in the PC business throughout the year, as we bring more and more SKUs online ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

NAND demand continues to be strong driven by growth in enterprise and client SSDs as well as mobile device density increases ||| sales Positive Confident

I think if you have kind of product that they have, that's a pretty simple way to go to marketplace ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Let me now provide you with some detail on our fourth quarter results ||| earnings Neutral Confident

And I remind you that the dollar strength for 2017 is ending up about where it was in 2016 on our trade-weighted basis ||| Neutral

Given the heavy reliance on cash in that economy, this is expected to soften consumer spending in the short term, but could well fuel economic growth and modernize the payment system in the long term ||| sales Positive Confident

Now are in low to mid-single-digits of decline in the second half ||| Neutral Confident

revenue growth continued to be solid across the business with the overachievement versus our guidance driven by a higher-than-expected uptick in holiday season traffic with our Media Solutions and customers ||| sales Positive Confident

In terms of the noncore revenue, I think is the question, we have created value bundles and we marketed those this year, bundles that include, we call them, Flots and other kinds of bundles that have things like fraud, audit defense and the ability to make sure that if anything happened, we had the ability for you to go in and keep an eye on your credit card and your credit reports ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

And I think, certainly, as there is a pressured consumer retail environment, we all want to capture every sale that we possibly can ||| sales Neutral Confident

Obviously, there are two factors that are affecting the growth in our new business bookings ||| sales Positive Confident

I'm not sure ||| Neutral

So, yet there are deals that if they convert could be significant going down the road, but we are already - the point I was making, Moshe, is that today digital is already and financial services is roughly in line with our company average ||| products_services Negative

We enable customers to meet the exponential data growth of the digital era where they must manage a complex hybrid world with data in the data center, the cloud and in edge computing, and externally linked applications and platforms ||| sales Positive Confident

Hi, Josh ||| Neutral Confident

Wamsi, let me take that ||| Neutral

Yeah ||| Neutral

So we still think we are in a growth phase, but I would just say, right now, the 5% that we talked about last quarter being up year-over-year, even though we were down a little bit due to timing in the first quarter, we feel right in front of us and its really around execution for us this year ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

Sales of our Affirm prone table increased nicely ||| Neutral Confident

So it makes sense from a longer-term standpoint to have that inventory available to support revenue growth ||| sales Positive Confident

In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter ||| Negative

It was a breakthrough quarter where we delivered year-over-year growth in both Personal Systems and Print ||| sales Positive Confident

In insurance, we're seeing broad-based growth across clients and strong demand for multi-service line managed service deals ||| products_services Positive Confident

Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders ||| earnings Positive Confident

Our momentum in QBO subscriber growth is driving top line revenue with online ecosystem revenue growing 30% again this quarter, at the high end of our 25% to 30% target range ||| sales Positive Confident

And that was a good-sized contract and a profitable piece of business ||| earnings Positive Confident

It's about the pipeline of health and wellness opportunities that we're pursuing, and it's about the execution of the team as we've had leadership in place there ||| organic_expansion Neutral Confident

Global GARDASIL sales grew 41% this quarter, also on strength in the U.S ||| earnings Positive Confident

And I feel very good about the clarity that we're bringing to this issue, both internally and in our external disclosures ||| Neutral Confident

International represented 35% of total revenues and was down 8.9% or 4.6% in constant currency, reflecting higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we continue to see overall improvement in developing markets ||| sales Negative

A  Maria Henry Yeah I would agree with that and I think that really helped us on the cash flow side ||| earnings Positive Confident

If you look at our new guidance for the year compared to last quarter, the 7% organic growth outlook is an improvement of 100 basis points, and we're raising our earnings per share guidance by $0.11. I'd appreciate if you could turn to slide 3 and let me review some of additional highlights from the third quarter ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident

These two facilities are expected to process nearly 85% of our e-commerce volume during the peak 2017 holiday season ||| Neutral

In Q4 FY 17 we grew revenue 5% year-over-year capping a full year FY 17 where we grew the top line 1% when adjusted for currency and divestitures ||| sales Positive Confident

Just to double click on Events, we expect Q1 2017 revenues to be proportionally similar to Q1 2016. For Consulting, we expect to see a modest year-on-year decline in revenues, when compared to the unusually strong 11% year-on-year growth from Q1 2016. Completing the primary drivers of our Q1 EPS, we expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%, and 27% on a normalized basis ||| sales Positive Confident

In summary, the third quarter showed continued improvement in our financial results ||| sales Positive Confident

The legacy products will continue in the market ||| products_services Positive Confident

As of February 28th, inventories were up 7%, driven by a higher average cost, due primarily to product mix and to support growth of our DTC businesses ||| Neutral

As you said, it's early for 2018 guidance, so we're not going through the individual components ||| Neutral Confident

revenue from our Media Division customers was $301 million in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year and up 15% excluding the impact of the six large Internet Platform Customers ||| sales Neutral

Thanks ||| Neutral

But obviously, it's going to take a time for those businesses to ramp to be able to realize that, and I think what we want to do is we don't want to constrain investment ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

So we clearly believe that having a single J-code is not what you want, right? If you believe that a biosimilar has to be a decision made by a physician, you want clarity around each single product has to be able to reflect in the marketplace ||| Positive Confident

Sure ||| Neutral

Thanks ||| Neutral

This offering alone was a 3-point drag to Epsilon's revenue growth ||| sales Neutral

Thank you, Rick ||| Neutral

Our strength in flash combined with the capabilities of the UCS and intent-based networking from Cisco is driving meaningful growth in the FlexPod business ||| sales Positive Confident

I think it's really too early to read anything into the fourth quarter sales results ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

You had asked about RAs, the refund advances ||| Neutral

They realize there is an opportunity to work with us to get it right ||| products_services Positive Confident

AWS, we don't see really much in the marketplace ||| Neutral

So we're not updating our guide around that, feel good about the 105% to 115%, but certainly anticipate EBITDA margins to continue to improve ||| sales,earnings Neutral Uncertain

Our revenue growth this quarter experienced pressure as we began to lap our fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues ||| sales Positive Confident

On a combined basis, our adjusted revenue grew 11% in the third quarter of 2017. As Gene detailed, we are also progressing in accordance with our plans to integrate CEB into the Gartner business ||| sales Positive Confident

And in Communications, we expect also mid-single-digit growth on both the reported and organic basis with growth in each of our three businesses ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

Yeah ||| Neutral

But yes, secondarily, I think that we do want to stay in a particularly strong capital and balance sheet standpoint in order to take advantage of things like new brands that might come where we could invest in them, much in the same way as we did with Under Armour, and drive increased top line in the future ||| debt Positive

Give us three months to finish out this plan ||| Neutral

Within the seasonal event moments, our 4th of July holiday was strong as we quickly leverage guest and business insights from Memorial Day ||| sales Positive

This store is off to an excellent start in its first few weeks ||| sales Positive

And so there's a long way to go to get back to that $300 million and that would not be even adjusting for inflation and for growth ||| sales Positive Confident

I mean, clearly, there is capacity coming online, but that's also a little bit of recognition that there is global protein growth around the world ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

Another strong quarter of cloud services performance drove our commercial cloud revenue run rate over $15.2 billion, growing 52% ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

Our product portfolio has the stretch to continue to evolve with consumer needs ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

So, we're real pleased with that growth ||| sales Positive Confident

As I said, were here forecasting 24% growth for the year thats our official guidance ||| sales Positive Confident

Thanks, John ||| Neutral

So in February, early February, we won our first business first step of a process with one of those SPPs ||| earnings Positive Confident

First, while we see strong momentum and Client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third party analysts ||| sales Positive Confident

So, we're going to utilize the gross margin leverage we talked about earlier to continue to fund growth in both the Gartner sales force, again given the size of the market opportunity and the traditional CEB sales force to go capture that market opportunity over the long-term ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

Our memory business grew 58% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record ||| sales Positive Confident

With respect to IDO, the one thing I would say at a very high strategic level is that we see really promising modalities ||| Neutral Confident

Our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included total combined company adjusted revenue growth of 11%, driven by 15% growth for the traditional Gartner business and a 1% decline for the acquired CEB business; combined adjusted EBITDA of $149 million and combined adjusted diluted EPS of $0.65 per share, which is $0.13 above the top-end of our guidance range for the quarter ||| sales,earnings Negative

We reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $124 million and EPS of $0.84 per diluted share ||| earnings Positive Confident

And in terms of ACZONE, the distribution model there is in flux ||| Neutral Confident

And we expect to be at 34% this year ||| Neutral

And good morning, everyone ||| Neutral

At current rates, we expect more moderate impact in the second half, especially in Q4. Overall, we anticipate continued strong margins in Q3, although seasonally, Q3 is not as strong as what we'll see in Q4, where typically margins peak for us ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

This is only done when the first two options don't provide a better solution ||| Neutral

But from time to time where we see the opportunity, we won't let short-term margin objectives do something that might be detrimental to the long-term growth of the business ||| Neutral

Turning to the performance of CEB research in the quarter, CEB adjusted research revenues were flat year-on-year in Q3, a modest improvement from the year-on-year decline in Q2.

Number two, if we get them onboard and trained over the course of 2017, while there'll still be new sales people, who inherently have lower productivity, they will actually yield some benefit in 2018.

So that slowing trend of benefits participation coupled with lower inflation of benefits per worksite employee is what led to slower growth, if you will, in the PEO, but the 12% worksite employee growth is still very, very strong, so we're still very happy with what we consider to be net revenue growth in the PEO which is now growing almost in line with worksite employees whereas historically had grown a little bit faster because of this pass-through cost pressure ||| sales,op_costs Positive Confident

Thank you, Shanye ||| Neutral

Our sales force is pretty confident that penetrating our products into their installed base set of customers is a matter of giving them more products to sell, and I think that by stepping up investment in R&D, getting more products announced, I think will lead to kind of more revenue ||| sales,products_services,organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

So, our investment thesis is that there is usually a direct correlation between gross margin and EBIT across the FMCG industry but in beauty industry ||| earnings Positive Confident

Servers had another strong quarter outside of Tier 1.

So I think it's early to make this judgment ||| Neutral

That's both growth, but also as you would expect as we start to come on board with some of these centers, we rationalize our presence in a zip code and we might shut down some of our smaller patient service centers and saves us some money as well ||| earnings Positive Confident

Telcos are going through a significant transformation as trends such as SD-WAN, 5G, IoT, and overall broadband growth are driving the need to evaluate Cloud-grade architectural shift in order to increase automation, reduce costs and enable greater service speed and agility ||| op_costs,products_services Positive Confident

And if we didn't do what we know we have to do, have the best product and have the cleanest value prop, I think that's going to be good news for the category and good news for us ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

That matters a lot ||| Neutral

This is the way we like to win ||| Neutral

Total operating expenses grew 12%, with LinkedIn contributing 13 points of growth, including $153 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense ||| sales,op_costs Positive Confident

And MQSA data statistics suggest that 3D still represents well less than half the overall market, so we still have many quarters of solid performance ahead of us ||| earnings Positive Confident

Yeah ||| Neutral

Having said that, I think that there are some things that are going to be happening at some point in the future around metro buildouts, around new modes of delivering services to enterprises that leverage things like new Cloud-managed solutions to connectivity and security that we are very much engaging with our customers on today, difficult to tell exactly when that will result in actual revenue growth for us ||| sales,products_services,organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

Now to try to come back to the core of your question, if you had to pin us down in terms of what would be the number one variable that sits in front of us right now, you still have to come back to the Individual market just because as an industry there's variability relative to that ||| earnings Neutral Uncertain

So if we can get our stuff together in the MDR, get the acceptance expansion going, build the right digital tools and QR tools, and roll those out, while also not losing focus on cards, I think there is a really interesting opportunity over the next five to seven years in India ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

For the quarter, our net revenue growth was 10%, EPS growth 7% or 31% EPS when you normalize for taxes ||| sales Positive Confident

We've developed a strategy where we improve taste, experience and our value proposition all while clarifying our brand message in order to ensure profitable, strong, transaction-driven unit level economics ||| Positive Confident

We were off to a positive start in 2017 and delivered strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the March quarter ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

I do ||| Neutral

As the industry continues to transition to 64-layer 3D NAND, we estimate industry bit supply growth in calendar 2018 will approach the 50% range, which should better satisfy the current unfulfilled demand ||| sales Positive Confident

So two things ||| Neutral

com, Computer Sciences Corporation, ADT and the University of Michigan ||| Neutral

Brett, you want to take that? ||| Neutral Uncertain

We plan to unveil new Adobe Sensei capabilities at Adobe Summit ||| Neutral

And that's what we said we would do ||| Neutral

So it's the high end of that 25% to 30% ||| Neutral

So some of that is continuing, but overall I would just say the Latin America business is getting healthy growth across the board ||| sales Positive Confident

So the first part around competition and competitive pressure, I mean, we are seeing it in the markets, or in the meats, as you say, and we are also seeing it from competitors ||| competition Negative Confident

I'll now hand you back to John for a review of international business ||| Neutral

And from an operational perspective, this would be adjusted EPS growth of 8% once you normalize with the unusually low tax rate we had last year that Heath just highlighted ||| sales Positive Confident

Performance trends from Q3 should continue into Q4, with annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65% ||| sales,earnings Neutral

Well, let me start and then I can have  Tom can talk a little about the products ||| products_services Neutral

We drove impressive topline growth with net revenue up 11% year-over-year to $13.9 billion including double-digit growth and share gains across the Americas, EMEA, and APJ ||| sales Positive Confident

I think Jan described it well which is it's a very broad strategy around differentiation and strengthening our products, as well as we don't mind earning a little bit of extra revenue and income from selling those types of products ||| sales,earnings,products_services Neutral Uncertain

Thanks Mike and good afternoon ||| Neutral

The majority, therefore, and just do the math, the majority did come from typically HiSeq customers and HiSeq X customers ||| products_services Positive Confident

We're working with multiple foundries on that ||| Neutral

Yeah, thanks for the question, Mitch ||| Neutral

And you got it right, its very cash generative, very profitable business, very broad-based in terms of the number of engagements and number of customers ||| earnings Positive Confident

By the end of 2017, we had shipped about 1,300 Panthers to diagnostics customers with about 800 of these in the United States ||| products_services Positive Confident

I think we had said previously when we studied California that we had not seen any significant effects there and obviously we'll be monitoring New Jersey very carefully ||| op_risks Neutral Uncertain

Again, most of that is memory ||| Neutral

The non-measured, the online channels are growing at a rapid rate and so you can't see some of the customers that are in there ||| products_services Positive Confident

This performance is below the 1 point of share gain that we strive to achieve each year and we're already designing innovative ways to accelerate customer growth as we look ahead to next season ||| sales Positive Confident

Segment operating income was $374 million and was down 2% ||| earnings Negative Confident

We believe the full-year 2017 glass price declines will be more moderate than 2016. In fact, we may see the smallest declines in the last five years, as the profitability of our competitors remains low and supply/demand remains in balance ||| earnings Negative

So, everyone should join us then ||| Neutral

So the first two quarters of this fiscal year should not look that different from the first two quarters of this fiscal year from a revenue growth standpoint ||| sales Positive Confident

We do expect Industrial segment margins to resume expansion in our fourth quarter, and this will be both on a sequential and year-over-year basis, driven by a combination of both growth and cost actions ||| sales,earnings,op_costs Positive Confident

And these initiatives will help to position us for additional growth by enabling us to reinvest in our business, while delivering bottom line growth in fiscal 2018 and 2019. Our final key metric is closed sales ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

So we have a broad snacking portfolio, which will likely win in that environment in addition to that natural organics core strength of ours as well with the third largest national organic player in the country, so thats good ||| competition Positive Confident

We believe these are important investments that will enable us to drive accelerated, sustainable, long-term double-digit top and bottom line growth ||| earnings,acquisitions Neutral

In total, adjusted operating expenses were 41.8% of sales, which is up 40 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter ||| sales Positive Confident

From a calendarization perspective, Q2 will face the most challenging year-over-year compare and we won't see a full quarter's benefit from the new product launch ||| products_services Negative Uncertain

And in the United States, KEYTRUDA is now the leader in terms of market share in first-line lung cancer ||| products_services Neutral Confident

It's now our job to be more intentional about the transformation needed in all areas of the business to drive solid growth and profitability into the future ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

, there's probably not a lot of share to keep gaining ||| earnings Neutral Uncertain

But it's important to say we didn't have cryptocurrency in our forecast, and we're not looking at it as a long-term growth driver ||| sales Neutral

And then Canada, another $400 million ||| Neutral

It could pass a little bit through to gross yield ||| Neutral

Yeah, no, thank you ||| Neutral Confident

This quarter, we were up 2% ||| earnings Positive Confident

As we talked about in May, we really gave 3% to 7% organic revenue guide over the horizon, with 13% to 18% earnings per share growth ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident

To conclude, we are pleased with our second quarter results, including strong financial performance, software and IP growth, and growing proliferation of our digital and sign-off solutions with market shaping customers ||| sales Positive Confident

First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $110 million, up 37% year-over-year ||| sales Neutral

So, I've had the same view of PayPal ||| Neutral

All of that transpired into us delivering EPS of $0.85 when we exclude the non-comparable items, and that does include Remy ||| earnings Neutral

It's typically going to be for more scale out type of applications, think of the CPE space where the physical CPE business has generally been a small revenue generator for Juniper ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

Our server products and cloud services revenue grew 15% and 16% in constant currency with double digit annuity revenue growth ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

Payments grew 1.1% for the quarter, reflecting difficult EMV card production comparables that we have previously discussed ||| products_services Positive Confident

And interestingly on Aruba in the U.S ||| Neutral

In our commercial business, we saw 12% growth on a global basis and it was double digits in every geography, which is always good to see ||| sales Positive Confident

Based on preliminary data, premium retail area growth year over year was robust, particularly in North America and China ||| sales Positive Confident

Then the remaining amount of that free cash flow and any other opportunities that we would have, including re-levering, as we described at Analyst Day, we would view as opportunistic ||| Neutral

That was the highest number of pre-samples ||| Neutral

Some of the additional admin expenses that I mentioned around the foundation and compensation and other things are more one-time items ||| op_costs Positive Confident

We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers ||| products_services Neutral

Sorry, I haven't been focused on Q4 last year ||| Neutral

If you go further down the page, you can see the changes in debt, $200 million ||| debt Neutral

And again, you may not always see it in the short term, right, it's like athletes can win doing steroids or other things ||| products_services Positive Uncertain

Sure, so yeah ||| Neutral

Total operating expenses grew 9% and 10% in constant currency, with LinkedIn contributing 12 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense ||| sales,op_costs Positive Confident

It will eventually start to normalize closer together on the growth rate perspective ||| sales Positive Confident

Both would be strong ||| Neutral

Adjusted EBITDA was $191 million compared to $103 million a year ago ||| earnings Neutral

And the way they're going to be smaller is to use technology to enable process inside the store more efficiently and fulfillment inside the store more efficiently, and use our speed initiative and our sourcing strategies and our localization initiatives to be able to make better decisions on which brands and which categories are emphasized more in a smaller footprint ||| Positive

Thanks, Jeff ||| Neutral

Okay ||| Neutral

Great, let me take both of those ||| Neutral

Well, this is Mike ||| Neutral

So I do think it's important to keep that in mind ||| Neutral

So I wouldn't expect any material impact ||| Neutral

Now, this growth we saw in the industrial equipment side is really due to our position in the factory automation and medical markets, also coupled with the acquisitions that we completed last year, and this is really driving the strong growth ahead of the market on both a reported and on an organic basis ||| sales,organic_expansion,acquisitions Positive Confident

So, ultimately, we think it'll flow ||| Neutral

It was very strong across all of the geographies ||| Neutral

We are not forecasting those items to occur again in 2017. Normalizing for those items, the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance yields 14% EPS growth versus 2016, which is in line with the midpoint of our EBITDA growth guidance for 2017. For 2017 we are guiding operating cash flow of $385 million to $415 million, or 5% to 14% growth on a year-over-year basis ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

We haven't had  John, it's Joe ||| Neutral Confident

It definitely has continued through April ||| Neutral

But the orders and the reorders have been very strong ||| sales Positive

Yes ||| Neutral

Within the Solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines ||| products_services Neutral

This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment ||| Positive

John W ||| Neutral

So we feel good about that ||| Positive Confident

Thanks, Mark ||| Neutral

I just mentioned Security ||| Neutral

As a reminder, our tax rate is impacted by at least three major factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests ||| sales,products_services Negative

But I kind of believe there's enough secular growth opportunity in this space for a lot of us to flourish ||| sales Positive Confident

And that raise was oversubscribed ||| Neutral

We want to make sure that we have enough customer resources to help our customers ramp into production ||| products_services Neutral

We are driving incredible innovation ||| Neutral

Pivoting the free cash flow, Q2 2017 CapEx was $31 million and Q2 cash acquisition and integration payments were $48 million, compared to less than $1 million in Q2 2016. This yields Q2 free cash flow of $129 million, approximately 50% higher when compared to combined company free cash flow in Q2 2016. The timing of our contract value growth is a key driver of our quarterly free cash flow performance and our strong research results from March and across Q2 have begun converting to free cash flow ||| sales,organic_expansion,acquisitions Positive Confident

We were happy with it and we take it ||| Neutral

With a lower than expected revenue contribution from NACC, we expect recurring fee revenue growth to be closer to the lower end of that range ||| sales Positive Confident

ICS recurring fee revenues benefited from organic growth in our communications business and from growth in data and analytics, tax, and other new product lines ||| sales,products_services,organic_expansion Positive Confident

And then for the second question, I was wondering if you can speak to sales force productivity x-L2, that's  it's really strong improvement year-over-year, so any further elaboration on which training programs are driving this ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

What I would say is I think the sales team is hitting the ground running on storage ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

So I appreciate you being aggressive ||| Neutral

Let me walk you through the details ||| Neutral

So, we like being in this business and we see the growth continuing ||| sales Positive Confident

That's the bulk of it ||| Neutral

But most of those are either one time or they're temporary investments ||| Neutral

Second, we had solid price realization in most segments during the year despite a deflation in key commodities like dairy, coffee and meat in the U.S ||| op_risks Positive Confident

Clearly, it had an impact on the business ||| Neutral

The connected care into COPD, again, is a long-term, you know we call it Horizon 2, Horizon 3 Strategy, but it's incredibly strong on benefits ||| products_services Positive Confident

As Stephen mentioned in the LPS segment, you saw margin dilution ||| products_services Negative Confident

Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $187 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers ||| sales Neutral

In the past, we didn't have that type of environment ||| Neutral

We also saw year-over-year and sequential growth in our EX products ||| products_services Positive Confident

On a normalized basis, our quota-bearing sales growth was around 11.5%, and we continue to plan for approximately 13% sales head count growth in 2017. Moving on to EBITDA and earnings; adjusted EBITDA was $106 million in the first quarter, meeting our Q1 EBITDA expectation ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

I'll handle that one ||| Neutral

I think competition is finding it extremely difficult to compete across the leading edge of the technology of the product, which drives the different performance parameters in terms of electrical efficiency being one, beam quality, the tremendous scale that we have on manufacturing, the service and support we have around the world, the application laboratories that support that service and sales, the investment that's gone into that ||| sales,products_services,organic_expansion,competition Neutral Uncertain

We've had good sales growth over multiple years, double-digit revenue growth, generating great margins because now we've got scale, and the business is  I would just call it humming along ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

And so we would expect it to take a couple of quarters for us to ramp the Naples product over time ||| products_services Neutral

Anyhow, we saw significant improvement this year ||| Neutral

Vijay ||| Neutral

This is for Michael Millman ||| Neutral

Yeah ||| Neutral

Having said that, Moshe it's Frank, I think it's worth adding one additional piece of color for you which is that, Karen mentioned that last quarter digital revenue as a percent of total company revenue was about 26% ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

And as you ramp CapEx, as a percent of revenue you should be ramping depreciation as a percent of revenue in a similar way ||| sales,organic_expansion Neutral

The other thing is asset tagging ||| Neutral

We believe we're there now ||| Neutral

And I want to be very, very clear with that, that we see the number of applications being deployed in private and public cloud and specifically in virtual ADC market, we see that as a growth market ||| sales Positive Confident

You saw Google talk about it a couple weeks ago ||| Neutral

The way we've described it is, and we've been consistent here, 2014, 2015, 2016, we expected not to make money, be it on an allocated or fully allocated basis, et cetera ||| earnings Positive Confident

We used to sell it always as a system ||| Neutral

No ||| Neutral

Sure, Matt ||| Neutral

And second, our guidance includes approximately $8 million of Booster-related expense or about $0.02 a share, which will fall primarily in SG&A ||| op_costs Neutral

We also now expect the entire NSG segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018 versus our prior end of 2018 target ||| earnings Positive Confident

Networking revenue grew 14% driven by Aruba Wireless Solution, which was up over 30% ||| sales Positive Confident

Federal ||| Neutral

And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company ||| sales,earnings Neutral

So the growth in liquid biopsy is enabled by people having access and more customers having access to more power at lower costs ||| products_services Positive Confident

This represents 3% reported growth, 4% organic growth on the top line and 11% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks of fiscal 2016. Relative to our prior view of revenue guidance, reported revenue growth is down 200 basis points due to the $300 million impact from the currency exchange rates ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

We introduced our first Vega-based Radeon Instinct datacenter products in June ||| products_services Neutral

Yes, I believe that our operating margin for the full-year can be very similar to the margin that was last year ||| earnings Positive

Throughout AmerisourceBergen, we have the strongest customer base in the industry ||| products_services Positive Confident

So I think you summarized the revenue guidance well ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

Our philosophy around this is that we have to have strong organic plans to do that and there's a number of things we're doing organically that we've started executing on that we'll be able to discuss at a later stage, not today ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

Owner/Operators ||| Neutral

The good news is, as our average productivity has shown improvement for the last couple of quarters, that gives us the confidence in more areas quite frankly ||| products_services Positive Confident

Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken ||| Neutral

I'll start with full year organic growth ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

We have done that for some time ||| Neutral

We want to make sure that when we expand home delivery, it meets up to the exceptional customer experience that we would expect and that our customers would expect ||| products_services Positive

Its not so much [Indiscernible] ||| Neutral

But we feel pretty happy and pretty satisfied with that kind of growth rate ||| sales Positive Confident

The hybrid direct and broker approach we implemented early this year is giving us greater focus on key accounts and channels, while more economically expanding our reach to new customers ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

Q2 sales grew 7% versus prior year, with two of our smaller international markets, Mexico and Russia, grew sales a 100% versus last year ||| sales Positive Confident

China, our largest geographic region from a revenue standpoint, was also among our fastest growth areas, up 89% year-over-year ||| sales Positive Confident

Then David will discuss unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development ||| Neutral

At this point, although we continually look at it regarding share repurchases, we're not planning on making any share repurchase at this time, but as you state, we'll look at the market and factors, share price, and we evaluate it, but at this point our goal is to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain the quality of our balance sheet ||| sales Positive Confident

And so, if you look at the distribution of some of these deals, they have been distributed throughout the United States ||| products_services Positive Confident

So we'll continue to try to do that ||| Neutral

This is a key focus for us as well ||| Positive Confident

So, a combination of few items ||| Neutral

And we'll give updates on a periodic basis ||| Neutral Confident

I think it's the start of a steady growth pattern that we should see throughout fiscal 2018, 2019 and beyond ||| earnings Positive Uncertain

And when you have good brand-building support and strong innovation, your merchandising works even harder for you ||| products_services Neutral

That will be modest, but I would expect the real de-levering to start moving in earnest over the course of 2018 and through 2019. And again, within 24 months to 36 months, we're targeting to get down to three times gross leverage ||| debt Negative

Here, the answer on the first part is there were a few openings that just carried over to the first quarter and there were a few relatively big hotels  we had a large hotel in Cairo, one in New York and another in Rio that we had expected in the fourth quarter, and just for a whole bunch of different reasons, it will be the first quarter ||| Neutral

In terms of orders, total product orders growth was flat with book-to-bill greater than 1. Let's take a look at our geographies, which is a primary way we run the business ||| products_services Positive Confident

But we're continuing to invest as Hikmet said ||| Neutral

As you know, we've reduced inventory by over 40% over the last number of years ||| Neutral

And, quite frankly, we believe that's at a minimum $3 billion based on the analytics, market check performance that we've administered now over quite a lengthy period of time, and so our outlook at January 1, 2020 and beyond is very much guided by that reality ||| earnings Positive Confident

So let me wrap up the call ||| Neutral Confident

But, it's early days ||| Neutral

If I can just add, if you look at the margin trend compared to 2016, 2016 we had 31% gross margin ||| sales,earnings Neutral

And of course, we had to go down, wind down some inventory that we had, but we are experiencing the contract as we anticipated ||| Neutral Confident

With that, we will open up the lines for your questions ||| Neutral Confident

We consider the $500 million in terms of guidance ||| Neutral

But over the course of multiple years, we all know you do better science; you get higher diagnostic yield as you move up that continuum ||| Neutral Confident

But Tim will provide a bit more color on that ||| Neutral

And we were proactive, as you probably are aware, in managing that assortment, from an SKU reduction point of view, but also with a focus on making our biggest brands and our bigger SKUs work harder within that assortment ||| products_services Neutral Dodgy

We did get help from tax ||| Neutral

For the quarter ended September 30, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales increased 11.6% to $1.72 billion, resulting in net income of $91.9 million, or $0.72 per diluted share ||| earnings Positive

Yes ||| Neutral

While we'll continue to focus on strengthening our go-to-market, integrating the recent acquisitions into your portfolio and driving targeted organic R&D, we are making solid progress since our stabilization in more profitable core servers, which declined less than 1% ||| earnings,organic_expansion,acquisitions Positive Confident

It's not like things are getting worse ||| Neutral

The fundamentals of our business remain strong ||| Neutral

Thank you ||| Neutral

We do have stuff in Asia ||| Neutral

WCI will continue to contribute to earnings as expected as purchase accounting and non-recurring cost dissipate and as cost benefits and SG&A savings accumulate ||| op_costs Positive

We continue to see the displacement of the installed base of lasers and then move towards higher power, both with fine metal and that should continue to provide some sustained growth for the company ||| sales Positive Confident

This decrease was driven by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations related to our service alignment initiative ||| sales,products_services,organic_expansion,op_risks Positive Confident

That's a mix of inventories being very low in the channel ||| sales Neutral

So it doesn't feel like there's a hangover of where production is ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

So, the way we think about M&A again as being very consistent and it's all around complementary IP, where we can leverage our distribution and drive profitable growth ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion,acquisitions Positive Uncertain

But I think that's a very reasonable target ||| Neutral

Question-and-Answer Session ||| Neutral

And the service that is top of mind for as Stock ||| products_services Neutral

But I think what we have seen in Germany is consistent with what we've seen in other early launch markets in Europe, which is number one, rapid adoption or rapid acceptance of the TAF profile and treatment guidelines ||| products_services Positive Confident

So we are very pleased with the reception to EPYC ||| Neutral

These positive year-over-year results were primarily due to rapid adoption of Gorilla Glass 5 and record Gorilla Glass volume which produced higher sales and a profit boost from its premium price; sales growth and higher profitability in optical communications; and LCD glass volume growth and moderate pricing ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

So I think our brands are well established with 20,000 restaurants doing it ||| Neutral

So again, caution that given the $12 billion of revenue, if it wasn't obvious from our comments, this is not an immediate game changer from a revenue growth standpoint, but it's an immediate game changer from a strategic standpoint and from a brand standpoint ||| sales Positive Confident

Inventories remain in the normal range ||| Neutral

However, we expect hardware revenue to be a little stronger for the second half ||| sales Positive Confident

That's where the effort is ||| Neutral

Turning to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $367 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year ||| sales Neutral

Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone ||| Neutral

And as you can see, that is driving online ecosystem revenue growth, where we're at the high end of the range at 30% 2 quarters in a row ||| sales Positive Confident

We work closely with David and his team at SDC ||| Neutral Confident

Deflation excluding fuel persisted at 1.3% compared to 1.1% in the third quarter ||| op_costs Neutral Confident

Good morning, Gary ||| Neutral

I think I have said before and I would still say that the server market has a longer design win to revenue conversion cycle ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

And as we talked about before when you look at the history, it had decline more or like in the mid-teens and that was primarily as the legacy wireless products had on loaned ||| products_services Negative

So we're feeling pretty confident ||| Neutral

We have created a lot of shareholder value here ||| Neutral

While, we are pleased with the uptick the products introduced in the first half of the year and excited about the opportunities the continuing influx of new products represent, we feel that the ongoing uncertainty in EMEA merits prudence as we approach our outlook for Q3. With this in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 is $520 million to $530 million ||| sales,products_services Positive Uncertain

Our R&D expense for the quarter was $408 million, including $22 million in non-cash stock compensation and $209 million in upfront and milestone expenses related to the amended Agenus collaboration and the new Merus and Calithera collaborations ||| earnings Positive Confident

And so, we will save the rent and the labor and the like ||| Neutral

That's kind of where I'm coming from ||| Neutral

Australia has them ||| Neutral

So that means it wasn't just sales Cloud ||| Neutral

Kevin will provide more details on the sales results in a few minutes ||| Neutral

Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $2.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 80% was held outside the U.S ||| earnings Positive Confident

Thank you, Ken ||| Neutral

So I actually feel good about all of those ||| Neutral

We don't plan based on hope ||| Neutral

Sure, Lorraine ||| Neutral

But again, we're very pleased that our results in this quarter demonstrate the progress that we're making, the progress against the plan that we have been consistently executing against now for really since the time and somewhat before I stepped into this role ||| Positive Confident

We expect the trend to continue the same ||| Neutral

Therefore the impact on net profit margin was only about 90 basis points ||| earnings Neutral

We also are adding manufacturing capacity ||| Neutral

So, in those markets, I would say we're holding in Latin America, doing exceedingly well in the ESSA region ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

In the third quarter, we used $28 million from our lower interest secured revolving line of credit to pay down long-term debt, which has a higher interest rate ||| debt Neutral

So lets dive right in ||| Neutral

Total operating expenses grew 1% and 2% in constant currency ||| op_costs Positive Confident

I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg ||| Neutral

And we continue to build on our industry-leading presence there as well ||| Neutral Confident

Because overall, we think the market in the mid-teens gives you a sense that -- our growth in the mid-teens gives you the sense that the market, we expect to grow greater than 10% ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

In Life Sciences, fourth quarter sales were up year over year and net income growth outpaced that of sales ||| sales Positive Confident

Consistent with last quarter, a detailed bridge of revenue growth from GAAP to organic is included in the appendix material ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

That said we still have significant areas to improve in 2017. They include Indonesia soy sauces, U.S ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

It was great to see so many of you at our recent Security Analyst Meeting here in Palo Alto ||| Neutral

Client computing revenue increased by strong double-digit percentage from a year ago, driven by a significant ramp and strong sell-through of our Ryzen CPUs in the first full quarter of sales ||| sales Positive Confident

We have seen good growth for the probiotics products in the poultry industry and our new business development efforts in the dairy industry are translating into new sales ||| products_services Positive Confident

I would also like to highlight that we also have a very strong quarter growth in our appliances business and we saw continued operational improvements throughout the segment that I will talk more about in a little bit ||| sales Positive Confident

We managed more than 100 trillion data transactions on behalf of our customers over the past year across our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions ||| Neutral

Yeah, I mean we're - Tim, as you know we guide one quarter at time, well give you a little bit of color which is what Martin did, when he said a little more balanced than the 55/45 and there's also reason I gave you the deferred revenue number, so you can think about how that likely transpires through the year ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

What I do know is that product acceptance when she's in the store, product acceptance is excellent for us and she hasn't stopped buying clothing ||| Positive

As I alluded to during the prior quarter, we introduced an additional Naked product with the Naked Chicken Chips, a creative twist allowing us to expand on our chicken platform ||| products_services Positive

The quarter's results also reflect continued growth in our premium Clorox Splash-Less bleach resulting in share gains on total Clorox liquid bleach ||| competition Positive Confident

North America revenue increased 1% on a reported and constant-currency basis, while transactions grew 2% ||| sales Positive Confident

Having said that we know its going to be bigger will be bigger and we have a fair amount of space dedicate and we can make that space even more productive overtime and we will ||| Positive Confident

So its not a first-mover advantage in a traditional sense ||| Neutral

There are some elements like indirect procurement, shared services where we'll get savings earlier ||| products_services Positive Confident

Trac will discuss the financials in more detail ||| Neutral

They typically launch new products in Q2 for the back-to-school season ||| products_services Neutral

And although margins were down from the first quarter of last year, we actually did improve quite a bit from the fourth quarter where we were in the C2B business ||| sales,earnings Negative

The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall ||| sales Positive Confident

Thanks, Will ||| Neutral Confident

And then also the element around D&D growth ||| sales Positive Confident

No, I think that it's a very fluid situation ||| Neutral Uncertain

And therefore, when we start seeing improvement in our private brand performance, we can anticipate more improved performance in the overall women's apparel business ||| sales Positive

And we are laser focused on five key elements of that strategy to enable our customers' success and drive profitable growth for us and shareholder value as well ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

Thanks for the questions Will ||| Neutral Confident

And I think weve proven that we can do that over the last 18 months ||| Neutral Confident

And to us, change equals opportunity ||| Neutral

Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $74 million and $76 million ||| op_costs Neutral

You have retinoids and antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, and it looks like the tolerability profile of this one looks pretty good, and it's going to be an alternative to doxycycline and minocycline, and that's how we're modeling it ||| products_services Positive Confident

But our overarching planning assumption as we rolled it up from the bottom netted out to about 13% territory growth and that's what we baked into the plan ||| sales Positive Confident

We ended the quarter with a cash balance, including short-term investments, of $1.6 billion, with $514 million held outside the United States ||| earnings Positive Confident

They can get the word out better than anyone else and they have done so yet again here ||| Neutral

So it's increased slightly ||| Neutral

So they compete aggressively on price ||| Neutral

So again, customers are buying solutions ||| Neutral

There's some multi-layer material ||| Neutral

We appreciate your interest in ADP ||| Neutral

We knew exactly what that was going to be worth in the fourth quarter last year ||| Neutral Confident

Customer adoption of our recently introduced products remains strong and our revenue is increasingly coming from more diverse sources, including Virtual Editions, public cloud solutions, and application security ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

It overall is a drag on total company organic growth in that zone ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

Neulasta declined 6% year-over-year due to a shift in timing of purchases by some larger end customers as well as a small decline in the number of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens ||| products_services Negative Confident

I can't say there were any real surprises ||| Neutral Uncertain

Kulbinder, this is Gino ||| Neutral

Now to verification, where our platform vision and technology execution have yielded excellent business and market share growth ||| sales Positive Confident

And then on the Commercial, we think there's a lot of opportunities associated with wallet share, doing a better job of penetrating our large group ASO block of business, as well as trying to retain and maintain our ACA-compliant and non-ACA compliant Small Group books of business ||| earnings Positive Confident

And when they start to come to bear on revenue it should be a good backup that we have ||| sales Positive Confident

It is a best-in-class patient support system that will provide a significant competitive advantage for Lash, be highly valued by our manufacturer partners, and also enable a better patient experience ||| products_services Positive Confident

We want to win our partners' loyalty by bringing them demand at a reasonable price rather than some sort of contractual block-out of other demand platforms ||| Neutral

So, our overall POS in the quarter, in the U.S ||| Neutral

where semiconductor growth is happening ||| sales Positive Confident

I would say the competitive pricing environment is maybe slightly mitigated, but it would be hard for me to gauge that, because it varies by country, it varies by product line and it shifts from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

And we've had a number of openings, both in Grand Island and in Inchinnan in Scotland, where the customer feedback has been incredibly positive ||| products_services Positive Confident

The last piece I would say is 2 parts ||| Neutral

In fact, we now have over 4,500 GNP and Elevate customers ||| earnings Positive Confident

Turning next to aviation, we reported solid revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in aftermarket products and led by strong growth related to our ADS-B offerings ||| sales Positive

But in auto itself, I would say, when you look at the growth we've had, it doesn't pull in meaningfully or push out meaningfully because that's why we've had the extra cost ||| sales,op_costs Positive Confident

Our goal is to try to accelerate revenue longer term, so we do want to put some of the money back into growth opportunities ||| sales Positive Confident

So as there was the industrial recession going on that impacted our Industrial segment, it did also impact the Measurement asset, then the growth was a little bit slower ||| sales Positive Confident

Total fourth quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4.4% on a comparable currency-neutral basis ||| earnings Positive Confident

Second quarter revenues were up 4.1% year over year, driven mostly by our growth in insurance ||| sales Positive Confident

So there's a number of things that are in play by the administration, generally speaking over 67 years we have benefited from whether it's one particular party or another particular party or one philosophy versus another philosophy because generally there's change, there's constant change and I think, employers use services like ours to help them manage through that change ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Let me take the first question ||| Neutral

I think as I said at the opening of my comments, the absolute key for us is going to be to execute ||| Neutral

And clearly from our point of view, the engagement that they do with their customers or how they deliver their experience continues to be we think one of the key ways in which people make digital tailwind rather than a headwind ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

But also as we've mentioned in prior calls, we have a series of initiatives underway and our order fulfillment team really focusing on improving the gross margin ||| Neutral Confident

This is not license model ||| Neutral

Let me wrap up, and I just want to summarize here for a moment ||| Neutral

As a reminder, our operational basis presentation excludes the impact of foreign exchange, U.S ||| op_costs Neutral Confident

You've got new products that have entered the market that to some degree I describe as me-too products that are entering the market at inflated price points with no incremental effectiveness over the existing therapies ||| products_services Negative Confident

As we discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times, including the repurchase program ||| organic_expansion Neutral

The unbilled deferred revenue at 30% is a slight acceleration and a very, very big number in terms of growth ||| sales Positive Confident

And great question ||| Neutral

That's correct, Dave ||| Neutral

And well go to the next caller please ||| Neutral

Now, traffic remains an issue ||| Negative

As synergy comes online, as we continue to grow particularly if you think about high-performance compute and some of the areas of the portfolio, again excluding tier 1, from a year-over-year component, we would expect to return back to growth in the latter part of the year ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

That will diminish a little bit ||| Neutral

And with the dividend model that we announced last quarter, it provides a more reverse framework to adjust allocation between -- of that return between dividend growth and share repurchases ||| sales Positive Confident

ACH has been a country-by-country business ||| Neutral

And so I think this acceleration of our net new actives is coming at a lower cost to it, so it's really found sort of one-two punch thats positive for us now, but especially as we look forward ||| op_costs Neutral Uncertain

And they all came out with TV ads ||| Neutral

It's our largest Events and Consulting quarter ||| Neutral

Thank you ||| Neutral

This is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth ||| sales Positive Confident

Thank you very much for allowing me to say that ||| Neutral

But, overall, I'd say if you look at the field organization, and the big takeaway is that we're executing now internationally whereas we had been driving a lot of the growth domestically over the last couple of years ||| sales Positive Confident

Now they are targeting that more and more as well ||| Neutral

For the year, we opened 113 stores and closed six Del's stores ||| organic_expansion Neutral

F5 delivered revenue of $518.2 million in fiscal Q2, reflecting year-over-year revenue growth of 7% ||| sales Positive Confident

So to strengthen our brands, we've increased our advertising and marketing as a percent of sales by 145 basis points over the past five years and increased it by 40 basis points in just this past year alone ||| op_costs Negative Confident

This is going to take a year or more ||| Neutral

I know we had a negative free cash flow in Q1, but the cadence seasonality in our business we should see a nice positive free cash flow in our March quarter somewhat neutral to up a little bit the June quarter and then traditionally our fourth quarter is pretty high in terms of free cash flow ||| earnings Positive Confident

In closing, the third quarter was a strong quarter and we are pleased with the momentum of our new premium products ||| products_services Positive Confident

This is an uptick from Q1 levels, primarily due to some planned facility and IT upgrades as well as continued expansion of our Secure Delivery Network and Prolexic scrubbing capacity ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

We feel good about our competitiveness our assortments our brand portfolio and the innovation we're bringing to market ||| products_services Positive Confident

And again, I think it's getting all the clients on one platform so that you make all your investments and you put all your focus and all your R&D on one platform ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

To align by product categories, our customers think about ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

We are providing access to business coaching, manufacturer promotions and new reporting tools that incorporate point of sales data ||| Neutral Confident

So to sum it all up, business is strong ||| Neutral

A far as the Snacks business is concerned, obviously, I'm not sure we'll see incremental volume or price pressure, as John alluded to ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

There's growth in indulgence and there's also growth in health and wellness ||| products_services Positive Confident

You know that they will be taking price up in those markets ||| products_services Positive Confident

Yeah, and think I also want to point out again, I want to say it one more time that clearly some of the pressure we're experiencing is from investments, because we have been investing in our sales force for example ||| sales,organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

We also support FDA's stated intention to issue regulations, outlining what information it expects to be included in product applications and in reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence ||| op_risks Positive Confident

So we're not ready ||| Neutral

We delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth ||| sales Neutral

We continued to received positive feedback in Europe and Asia from patients, physicians, home care providers regarding both the broad fit range as well as the enhanced comfort of the N20 and F20. This quarter, we also achieved solid growth in our AirSense 10 range of devices, as well as our non-invasive ventilators and Adaptive-Servo Ventilation range in Europe and Asia ||| products_services Positive Confident

Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $50 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 28% and coming in about 2 points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings ||| earnings Neutral

Bear in mind that it is a long-term target ||| Neutral

EBITDA margin of 24% in the quarter compared to 25% in the prior-year period, while adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.3% compared to 26.5% in the prior-year period with the decline attributable to the same factors as operating profit margins ||| sales,earnings Negative

In quarter four, total revenue was up 7% year-over-year with growth across all three geographic regions ||| sales Positive Confident

So, I think that's part of what's going on ||| Neutral

So today, nearly 30% of our revenue is outside of the Americas and this represents a huge, huge growth opportunity for us ||| sales Positive Confident

So, we are leveraging those resources and its relationship as well ||| Neutral Confident

And in SubCom, growth was 22% organically in the quarter reflecting the strong growth cycle of this business ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

What inning do you think you guys are in in that process, especially with AMD coming to market with new products? Is there still a mix, a potential story here, and what would drive that? ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

The incremental media didn't happen in the first half, it will happen in the second half ||| Neutral

Our routing business grew year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of PTX revenue growth as well as modest growth in MX ||| sales Positive Confident

So we are looking and there are opportunities where sales forces are at least talking about some of the other products in our portfolio ||| products_services Neutral Confident

Yeah ||| Neutral

So, thanks for the question, Jeff ||| Neutral

Now, let's talk about some of the highlights in the quarter, starting with our industry strategy, again one of our growth pillars ||| sales Positive Confident

Looking ahead, we see year-over-year growth in the first quarter in sales, net income and EPS ||| sales Positive Confident

I highlighted my comments opening in 8,000 square foot format for Old Navy with the very early returns being positive and 8,000 square feet opens up a bunch of infill opportunities that we feel can be highly productive, but again early days on that ||| products_services Positive Uncertain

Turning to margins, gross margin of 33.8% was down 200 basis points year-over-year and down 240 basis points sequentially ||| sales,earnings Negative

We have a strong innovation lineup for fiscal year 2018 with some of these items already on shelve ||| products_services Positive Confident

Growth from Windows 10, the shift toward higher gross margin products and services in devices and gaming, and disciplined operating expense management resulted in operating income growth of 33% and 37% in constant currency ||| sales,earnings,op_costs,products_services Positive Confident

It's just really the inverse of the historical buying model ||| Neutral

We want to grow them ||| Neutral

So we're proud of that momentum we're seeing ||| Neutral

2% to 3%, Ashish, in Q2. ||| Neutral

And so some of the confidence I think that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense into even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have ||| sales,op_costs,organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

It can be macro-impacted ||| Neutral

Our focus is on scaling our healthy food selection and optimizing our key categories in the health quadrant and elevating our beauty offerings while improving shopability ||| products_services Positive Confident

There was also some improvement frankly in the overall market and in all  or easy compares in Q3 than they were in Q1 and Q2.

We have a lot of things going on in the off-price side that's driving some really good growth, and we have some new markets that we've been expanding that's driving some really good growth ||| sales Positive Confident

So, I think there are some areas where we're probably may not making the  or we're not growing with the market because, again, we focus some of our investments in some of those other areas that support the food area or support pharma, et cetera ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

It'll flow like that ||| Neutral

Lastly, just to reinforce, we're pleased with, while we don't like to shrink, we're pleased with the fact that our retention rates held up quite strongly through this process and I think that's a further validation and testament to the strength of the physician partnerships and collaboratives, with 85% of all of our MA lives in collaboratives and our very strong HealthSpring team that wakes up every day to serve our customers ||| earnings Neutral Confident

In Q4, we expanded relationships with U.S ||| Neutral

As we deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, we remain focused on three priorities ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

As you know from prior conversations, we viewed that the marketplace 2014, 2015 and 2016 specifically we call version 1.0. We viewed that it would be a relatively choppy ride in the implementation of all the new attributes of the program; that the marketplace in total would be smaller than projected and unprofitable overall ||| sales Positive Dodgy

They have to get ramped up ||| Neutral

The channel inventory was well under control ||| Neutral

So, think in the 60%, 70% of the change, balance related to some softness on TA and Evanta revenues ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

Before I discuss the details of our business unit performance, I want to spend a few moments on the evolving policy landscape ||| earnings Positive Confident

We are going to continue to face some headwinds from Tier-1s that was down versus Q3. But we are feeling much better about that core business and you really need to think about this as stabilizing the core transactional rack and tower business while we pivot the portfolio to higher margin and higher growth segments in the marketplace and thats working ||| sales,earnings Neutral Uncertain

But I can tell you that the discussions with retailers have gone well ||| organic_expansion Positive Uncertain

Client ASPs were up 7% year over year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong ||| sales Positive Confident

But we also think there are opportunities that we're exploring of how we work in that whole ecosystem because it is a very different ecosystem, not only because of some of the issues that you've raised and the different companies that really are leading in that market, but also because of where the country is and how they're adopting technology and in some cases skipping whole generations of the way developed markets use the technology in going right to an end game solution ||| Neutral

Let me start with the smokeable products segment ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

I think it's also important that just to note that as we've said before that today our portfolio if you look at the entire portfolio of digital revenue it is running at a higher margin than the rest of the business ||| sales,earnings Neutral Uncertain

So in addition to stabilizing core rack and tower we are pivoting hard to our value and growth offerings like HPC, Synergy, SimpliVity, etcetera ||| sales Positive Confident

Both from a government customs perspective, but also our private sector clients also want to ensure some testing is done ||| products_services Positive Confident

Turning to the performance of CEB Research in the quarter; CEB adjusted research revenues declined by 1% year-on-year in Q2, an improvement from the 4% year-on-year decline in Q1. CEB's other research metrics also improved in the quarter ||| sales Negative

On an organic basis, excluding the contribution of L2, which we acquired in March 2017, total contract value growth for traditional Gartner Research would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, also an acceleration from the growth we delivered last quarter ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

While we did experience some temporary headwinds, including the impact of the hurricanes on some of our customers, rising inflation, and a challenging inbound freight environment, we remain on track to achieve a successful year and ultimately deliver on our three-year operating income target ||| op_risks Positive Confident

I think you're going to see that investment occur, it's going to begin in the first quarter ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

In addition, what we're really trying to work on now is in the non-expressers or in the patients that are not PD-L1 tested to reinforce that we have the indication for the combination to be used in those patients, which we think represents an additional significant opportunity ||| products_services Positive Confident

We booked that in the fourth quarter ||| Neutral

Drivetrain sales coming in at $883 million, that's up almost 17% organically, which was a really strong quarter from Drivetrain on the growth side and the really good news around that, that was strong all-wheel drive sales, but also on our transmission business ||| sales Positive

Our bit growth is supported by our 1X DRAM ramp, which represented mid-teens percent of our DRAM bit output in Q4 and will grow throughout the next several quarters to achieve bit output crossover as we exit calendar year 2018.

First, there were normal seasonal factors, including higher EPO utilization due to the flu season, higher payroll taxes in the first quarter of each year and two fewer treatment days ||| earnings Positive Confident

Q1 was a really tough comp ||| Neutral

And so while we of course get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors if it was actually quite broad there is not only one place for me to say that we just saw it here, and then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and the way youd see that cash, again versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there with that final piece around our security value prop, ATP - Windows annuity growth was very good ||| sales Neutral

Based on our past performance on our outlook for the remainder for the year, we now anticipate annual organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% for 2017.

Therefore, on an adjusted basis, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.80 and $0.85 for the second quarter 2017. In closing, we had a strong start to the year, and we expect this performance to continue throughout the balance of 2017. Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth, and contract value growth was 15% ||| sales Positive Confident

And we balance both of those out for the long term ||| Neutral

And Jeff, just to add to that, the way we think about it is, the best way for us to drive growth and penetrate accounts is for the people who specialize in selling IT, supply chain, HR, whatever it might be, to actually go do that and talk to the HR professional, supply chain professionals, marketing professionals direct ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

Also, we still plan ||| Neutral

First quarter 2017 operating margins of 12.7% declined by 90 basis points from the 13.6% in the first quarter of 2016. This decline was due to the impact of the Penn Treaty assessments that were recorded during the quarter, and the first-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. Partially offsetting the margin decline was the benefit of one less calendar day during the quarter, as first quarter 2016 was a leap year, a lower SG&A ratio due to expense efficiency initiatives, and fixed cost leverage from growing operating revenue ||| earnings Negative Confident

For example, agriculture is a very interesting segment and continues to drive demand for our microarray products ||| products_services Positive Confident

Yes, think of it  so first, absolutely you're right that we are going to move much more of our focus towards data center products coming first ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

That's what forecasting, current forecasting would suggest ||| Neutral

We haven't really changed the margin profile all that much, and again we're trying to drive significant growth in both of those businesses and so I'd expect margins maybe on research to improve a little bit as we're tracking a little bit behind the 70% over time, but essentially kind of tracking where we are ||| sales,earnings Neutral Uncertain

Hey Wamsi, its Terrence again ||| Neutral

I think that my point was that as we make these investments, these investments are going to take a bit of time to see revenue ramp, and so you're going to see the dividends from these investments more in 2018 and 2019.

Let's  let me go to your first statement, which is there are a lot of smaller companies to crap up various entry in terms of entering this business a pretty low ||| Neutral

If you just think about the software business as an example, Q4 is typically much higher than Q3.

Now in the UK, interestingly, despite ongoing concerns around Brexit, SpendingPulse showed solid overall retail sales growth of 5% in the quarter and that's partly driven by higher consumer spending due to rising inflation, the lower pound basically ||| sales Positive Confident

We are delivering strong results because we are executing on our reinvention and driving our strategy to protect our core, prioritize growth, and invest in the future ||| sales Positive Confident

In terms of looking forward, we feel very strongly, and we know this business pretty well, the way to drive increased margin and increased profitability is the yield total resort from a standpoint of driving revenue into the resort, and that will have a dampening impact on RevPAR, and that's okay because we're trying to drive more profits ||| earnings Positive Confident

Our first Halcyon system in Korea was ordered by a non-hospital ||| products_services Positive Confident

And as you get a bigger pool of assets going after the same goal, you obviously get better fees, so there is lots of ways it reduced our cost and generally speaking, the rating agencies do get it and understand it; it's -- I think I'll allow this for a second and everybody in the room just kind of looked at me like -- but we've actually talked, should we start talking about the leverage ratio closer to exactly how the rating agencies do it, so there isn't this disconnect between the two and we just put everything after the way we believe they look at it, they don't tell you everything but -- and then it's not; it's volatile as it seems when we add something, so that's something we're kicking around just to take some of the -- what seems like a growth in our leverage when it's just moving it from one part to another ||| op_costs Neutral Dodgy

Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon ||| Neutral Confident

We do think that based on what we see around retention potential because the real, one of the really important improvement to the small business division was the rise in retention which has a fairly big impact in that business on margins because the amount of business you have to sell, which brings with it sales cost, implementation cost, is less to achieve the same growth objective if you will ||| sales,earnings,op_costs Positive Uncertain

But I think if you were to adjust for that, you would still see growth in the double digits ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

Removed the noise though and it was a terrific 2016. Let's start with pro forma revenue of $7.4 billion, up 15% from 2015. We estimate that elevated redemption activity in Q4 added about $175 million or 3% growth to 2016. Essentially, AIR MILES that would have redeemed in 2017 were instead redeemed in 2016 ahead of the expiry, creating a pull forward of revenue recognition to 2016. Adjusted for that, revenue was approximately $7.2 billion, up 12% and consistent with the guidance ||| sales Positive Confident

revenue from our Media Delivery Solutions was $196 million in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year, but up 8% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers ||| sales Neutral

As you know, we've had lots of very good competition across many of our franchises over the years and every time a new competitor comes in, especially one that is well funded and they're aggressive in advertising and in pricing, that tends to accelerate the category growth because it gets more people and other masses to raise their head and get out of spreadsheets or come out of stores and say, wow, there might be a better way to do this ||| sales,competition Neutral

Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year over year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program ||| sales Negative

In addition, the higher growth rate this quarter was aided by post-launch inventory drawdown in the prior period ||| sales Positive Confident

Excluding the one-time adjustments, we saw good operating profit dollar expansion year-over-year ||| earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident

So first wanted to lay that groundwork ||| Neutral

Yes, we will look at some of their sectors for our patient service centers, but as importantly, what I said in my introductory remarks is, we are actually going to use this strong metric to provide some of the basic healthcare services that help with what we could do with population [indiscernible] to cost curve ||| products_services Positive Confident

Yeah, thanks ||| Positive Confident

I mean, I think in general that we continue to get good traction in upgrading Ion to our customers that buy our Web performance products that you can imagine that it's kind of a hierarchy of  it starts with customers that really, really care about performance ||| products_services Positive Uncertain

And so we think the elasticity is there by taking the prices per gene and therefore the prices per genome down below the X, it overall expands the market ||| earnings Positive Confident

Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone ||| Neutral

And then the other things Julian, asking about Silverline, I think you missed in this script was, were very much using Silverline as a competitive advantage, just against cloud based solutions and other service solution ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

And then there is what we expect in the future ||| Neutral

For the first half of the year, revenue increased 2.1% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $911 million, a 4.6% increase compared to the prior year period ||| sales,earnings,organic_expansion Positive Confident

At this point, we plan to file preliminary 2018 rates with the assumption that the cost sharing reduction subsidies will be funded ||| op_costs Negative Confident

I will now shift to discuss cash flow ||| Neutral

We have a lot more to do ||| Neutral

However, I wanted to share the tremendous progress we've made over the 12-month period ending in fiscal Q3. During that time, our bit output has been above industry average for both DRAM and trade NAND and our cost per bit has declined approximately 25% and 30% in those technologies respectively ||| op_costs Negative

Over the past five years, we have lowered the company's share count by over 7 million shares or 4% while also spending nearly $1 billion in strategic acquisitions, thereby deploying capital in areas that we believe are in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders ||| acquisitions Neutral

So what that means to our gross loss rates were down 18 bps year-over-year, take away the 15 basis points for the improved from the hurricanes, and that's roughly the flat year-over-year change in our gross loss rates ||| earnings Negative

I believe we are poised to see increased growth in year-over-year product revenue in Q2 and we have every opportunity to build in that momentum for the second half of fiscal 2017. In conclusion, Id like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners, and customers for their support last quarter, and with that well now hand the call over for Q&A ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

At the center of every great experience are customer intelligence and amazing design, and these are Adobes core competencies ||| products_services Positive Confident

So this is our view for the full year ||| Neutral

Part of it, it's sometimes hard ||| Neutral

If you think about some of the transitions we've already started making in the last few months around reorganizing the engineering team, the product teams and all these others ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Yeah, if you remember specifically, we tried to give you an implied number associate, but we're trying to give percentage growth over that horizon ||| sales Positive Confident

Unknown Speaker Okay ||| Neutral

It's been an exciting market ||| Neutral

Thats certainly chapter two ||| Neutral

I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investments, investments in sales, in the sales force, in ti ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

So, I would say and as I mentioned in my remarks, there's no one single thing driving the growth of those net new active ||| sales Positive Confident

So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned ||| sales Neutral

And what we saw in the quarter, we also had good reported growth in that business of 8%, and that's because Argentina didn't devalue as much as we had expected ||| sales Positive Confident

But just want to point out ||| Neutral

So, in summary, the segment continued to make progress in several key areas ||| Neutral Confident

We're seeing double digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets ||| sales Positive Confident

We intend to be -- continue to be acquisitive ||| Neutral

Real important question ||| Neutral Confident

If you go into the tax rate, Brett, if you go back to May, we looked at the bridge of earnings growth over the next couple of years ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

Let's move to the individual segments ||| Neutral

I think every transaction is competitive ||| Neutral

Contributing to stronger product revenue growth, the entire family of new iSeries appliances was available for the entire quarter ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

We saw strong growth in peer-to-peer payments, with P2P payment volume growing 57%, more than $64 billion for the year ||| sales Positive Confident

Generally, when we look at the capital spend that we'd had in the engineering spend, we are able to do the work that we want to do from AD perspective, and by the way an EV perspective and a connectivity perspective ||| Neutral

So it looks to be taking the same shape ||| Neutral

, our high-end La Mer and Jo Malone brands entered Sephoras flagship stores and began selling on its website, joining many of other brands  of our brands that are already successful there ||| products_services Positive Confident

Performance and Security Solutions contributed over 60% of our total revenue in Q1. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our highly differentiated, higher margin and more stable subscription model offerings ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

Thanks, George ||| Neutral

The first one is just typical seasonality ||| Neutral

Let's flip over to page four ||| Neutral

In closing, we're pleased with our ability to response to the challenges we faced in fiscal 2017. This year, we began to see signs that are improving service metrics and our progress on client upgrades are helping to drive improvements and retention ||| products_services Positive Confident

It could be used globally ||| Neutral

We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services ||| products_services Positive Confident

Our Software-as-a-Service revenue continues to grow rapidly ||| earnings Positive Confident

That alone does not account for the acceleration in CV growth ||| sales Positive Confident

I have the same view of Alipay ||| Neutral

Hi, Jeff ||| Neutral

I don't think there's any question about that ||| Neutral

During the fourth quarter, we saw an acceleration in our contract value growth along with sequential improvements in our retention metrics and sales productivity ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

We said that's our number one priority ||| Neutral

So I don't want to speculate on that ||| Neutral Confident

The ramp is right within the range we predicted it to be from a ramp of that product The second part of your question, is 7% high single digits, I'll just make it simple and say look, if you look mathematically, I think it would meet a minima of high single digits, but it's certainly not necessarily where we're targeting to get to, but it's a high single digit number ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

And obviously we are several billion ||| Neutral

On an organic basis, excluding the contribution of L2, which we acquired in March 2017, total contract value growth for the traditional Gartner Research would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, also consistent with the growth we delivered last quarter ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

We think there maybe some opportunity to cross-sell our traditional services into their clients and we'll continue to execute on that going forward ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Well, thanks, Nancy ||| Neutral Confident

We're looking for various forms of counterfeiting of products that may be trying to find their way into the market ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

So when you look at the pieces, the shorter cycle portions of the business and the channel reflects that as would some of the lower purchase price, lower aggregate priced instrumentation, had a good quarter in terms of growth and what was also encouraging is that bookings were continuing to grow in the longer cycle products, the things that we mentioned last quarter ||| earnings Positive Confident

I'll just leave it there ||| Neutral

We anticipate continued earnings before tax growth in 2017, as we execute the full captive strategy in the United States ||| earnings Positive Confident

And we're highly confident that because of the quality of the food we're putting into products this year, in particular in frozen meals, that we will get strong repeat ||| products_services Positive Confident

But it is a good question ||| Neutral

ADP revenues for the quarter grew 5% on a reported basis, 6% organic ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

Those are programs that take a significant amount of time if you know our products ||| products_services Positive Confident

Thank you, Barbara ||| Neutral

Its far exceeded our expectations ||| Neutral

The highlight of the quarter was a return to product revenue growth, which will remain our number one financial clarity throughout fiscal 2017. We continue to make good progress on sales execution fueled by the vast array of new products that we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Product sales in our Americas region continue to improve with another quarter of year-over-year sales product growth ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

Our effective rate is currently at 4.8% system-wide and heading towards the 5.6% as contracts step up to current rates, increasing roughly 10 basis points per year ||| Neutral

Physicians will become very comfortable using KEYTRUDA as the drug of choice in first-line lung where it's approved ||| products_services Positive Confident

Overall, U.S ||| organic_expansion Neutral Confident

I am hopeful they will finalize that ||| Neutral

There is clearly an opportunity for us to think about innovation for e-commerce, which is what we are all focused on ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

Thanks, Mitch ||| Neutral

And that also strengthens our A4 business ||| Neutral

Our goal is to re-accelerate the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the longer-term ||| sales Neutral

So again, we're going into a bit of uncharted territory, Ben, and we'll keep you tuned in on what we learn ||| Neutral Confident

Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $230 million, up $23 million from Q3 levels ||| op_costs Neutral

One thing we talk about a lot is the uptake in the product refresh, and I think at times we don't draw the conclusion we want you to draw when we make these comments, because we talk about  in the first full quarter, we want to see roughly 25% and we see that increasing over four quarters to 80% ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

So, Brian, Ill talk about the first part ||| Neutral

They play different roles ||| Neutral

And during the fourth quarter, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via the dividend, and we paid $300 million for share repurchases ||| earnings Positive Confident

And Martina will be able to help you with that ||| Neutral

So I think we're fortunate to do well ||| Neutral

Good morning, Dave ||| Neutral

Starting with fiscal 2016 EPS of $8.59, we are extremely pleased that we were able to deliver currency neutral EPS growth of 13.2% while overcoming notable headwinds ||| earnings Positive Confident

Good question ||| Neutral

Youre absolutely right ||| Neutral

Jan, I think that  sorry ||| Neutral

First, establishing a leadership team with diverse skills and experience early on is critical ||| Positive Confident

We also made a number of strategic additions to strengthen our portfolio in key growth areas ||| sales Positive Confident

And they're all growing huge double digits ||| Neutral

And then they'll publish upon the rates in the fourth quarter for that beginning of January 2018. So as you think through this, the two-month delay in data reporting clearly is putting pressure on the schedule and that's why people are saying, 'Okay even that they still have the goal, it's impossible that they can get there ||| products_services Negative Confident

More broadly, we think it's all about innovation ||| Neutral

Thank you, Wamsi, for the question ||| Neutral

We would expect that we continue to ramp that revenue through the second half of the year ||| sales Positive Confident

Hey, good morning, Tim ||| Neutral

And, Kelly, any comments on the ||| Neutral

And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case ||| sales,organic_expansion Negative Uncertain

Turning to Consulting; on an as-reported basis, first quarter Consulting revenues were flat year-on-year and increased by 2% on an FX-neutral basis, coming off a very strong Q1 last year ||| sales Positive Confident

Our investments in GPU compute and Radeon Instinct are continuing to build momentum ||| organic_expansion Neutral

Overall, 2016 was a year that had its economic and regulatory challenges, but I think we've navigated those successfully while putting significant points on the board as a result of our investments in digital, in safety and security, in data analytics, loyalty and processing ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you ||| Neutral

We saw strong growth across all four, leading to a 26% increase in revenue ||| sales Positive Confident

was largely around not enough specialists in the field and frankly we need more scale in our storage sales here and combining Nimble and 3PAR under Keegan Riley, I think is going to really help here ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

You're right that Q4 seasonally our strongest quarter from a revenues perspective each year and that normally occurs ||| sales Positive Confident

Were seeing a lot more people paying off the loans ||| Neutral

And so, I think, I have nothing negative to say about any of the other companies, we are all striving to be a good providers in a market that right now is doing very well and so weve had the benefits of making a number of investments over the years that are paying off particularly well right now ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

As to outlook, we're reaffirming our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion ||| products_services Positive Confident

And so we're going to be very focused on ensuring that we lead with the product message ||| products_services Neutral

I think that's true ||| Neutral

As we mentioned before, we see, in the normal seasonality of the business, the revenue growth rate to accelerate through the second half of the year, and this is consistent despite the fact that we've had a strong first half and it reflects our continued momentum ||| sales Positive Confident

The fact is that even at 8% or 10%, core payment transaction growth of 8% or 10% is attractive ||| sales Positive Confident

And this is distinctly Kroger ||| products_services Neutral Confident

Long term, we're looking to market expansion, with potential new indications such as negative symptoms, bipolar depression, and schizophrenia maintenance ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

I believe we've worked around a lot of that ||| Neutral

Non-GAAP operating expenses were $517 million, up 17% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiative ||| sales,op_costs Positive Confident

Net income was up 48% year over year ||| Neutral

I appreciate if you could turn to slide 4. We continue to see broad based strength in orders across our segments as well as balanced order growth across regions which reinforces expectations for a higher growth versus our prior view ||| sales Positive Confident

Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone ||| Neutral

Its going to be in container architecture ||| Neutral

So it's a long time for brands to be announced that they would have been sold, but to still be in the hands of their previous owners ||| products_services Neutral Confident

Next, I think across every service the momentum weve seen in Q4 and in particular, I would say, I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows E5, advanced threat protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

While APAC contributed 15% of revenue, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16% ||| sales Positive Confident

Our trillions of content and data assets, along with our deep category expertise in the markets we serve, give Adobe Sensei a unique ability to help customers tackle complex experience challenges ||| Neutral

Yes ||| Neutral

Let me give you a quick summary of our capital deployment activities so far this year ||| Neutral

And we learned through the rollout  our innovative SKIPPY PB bites items, that once you get past Halloween, there are some seasonality, downturn in the confectionary business ||| products_services Negative Confident

And we're still on the very early innings ||| Neutral

Those investments are probably going to extend beyond 2017. And so I think the interim model for the company, not the long-term model, I think, the interim model for the company is going to be the high 30s ||| organic_expansion Neutral Uncertain

So we havent kind of past so ||| Neutral

The Q3 effective tax rate was 29.9% ||| Neutral

Yeah ||| Neutral

Income taxes ||| op_costs Neutral

And the magic to me is the fact that we did placed more systems in 2017 than we did in 2016. And it's too early to fully predict an attach rate, but we think it will be very high ||| products_services Positive Uncertain

Second, our commercial business, we expect our commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth as we expand our install base, grow consumption, and execute well on renewals ||| products_services Positive Confident

But this is a big strategic initiative within the company ||| Neutral

Yes, I'll  good morning, Garen, I'll start and Steve can jump in ||| Positive Confident

Turning to slide 18, for 2017, we are reiterating our organic revenue growth rates and revising consolidated and segment revenue dollar ranges due to the divestiture ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

, where we are seeing increasing pressure from government payers as part of austerity measures ||| Neutral

Turning to the balance sheet ||| Neutral

Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market ||| sales Positive

We think off of this new base we start to go to more normal growth rates again ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

They have to get into the field ||| Neutral

But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

We want to continue to monitor the results throughout the spring season ||| Neutral

These products provide an experiential fragrance while cleaning the home, and while still early, Clorox Scentiva is off to a strong start ||| products_services Positive Confident

revenue from continuing operations of $7.4 billion was down 5% adjusted for divestitures and currency driven by declines in software and tier 1 server sales ||| sales Negative

Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% ||| Neutral

But we're starting to see some turnaround ||| Neutral Confident

We delivered a strong second quarter despite a more challenging business environment that included softer industry sales in the U.S ||| sales Positive

I will now provide a quick recap of our results ||| Neutral

So the value proposition we are delivering remains strong ||| products_services Positive Confident

In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we saw robust growth in Q4 revenue and profitability compared with the prior year ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

Thank you, Kevin ||| Neutral

We have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating costs down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow ||| earnings Positive

It was a means to an end that they have ||| Neutral

And OptumInsights revenue backlog grew 19% or $2.1 billion in the past 12 months with more than $1.5 billion added in the first quarter ||| earnings Negative Confident

For 2017 overall, we expect full-year sales to be consistent to up slightly from 2016. We expect continued sales growth in the auto market and lower heavy duty volume ||| sales Positive Confident

We obviously bring our scale to partners and when you talk to different platforms whether it'd be Baidu or Google or Samsung, the ability to tap into 17 million merchants we have that long tail of merchants, that's a very difficult asset for others to replicate and it's accelerating in its growth ||| sales Positive Confident

I feel good about what we can control ||| Neutral

Question-and-Answer Session ||| Neutral

EBITDA margin expanded 220 basis points to 31.2%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% to $3.82 per share ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

I'll start off with that ||| Neutral

BrandLoyalty's fourth quarter is looking good, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA expected to increase double digits year-over-year ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

So net-net all around, David, we're feeling very good about it ||| Positive Confident

Geoff, I don't know if you want to add anything? ||| Neutral

The OEMs launch their desktop products in about mid-June, and so they just started selling at the end of June ||| products_services Neutral

Thank you, Alex ||| Neutral

So the full year guide is low double-digit revenue growth, 2017 to 2016. I think, given our product portfolio being very much influenced by the PC  the Ryzen and PCs, Vega for GPUs as well as Naples from a server standpoint, we expect that the Computing and Graphics segment will be  will grow more so than the EESC segment overall on a year-over-year basis, just given some of the consumer markets move faster than some of the data center and server markets ||| sales,products_services Neutral Uncertain

Hi, Kulbinder, it's Rami ||| Neutral

Breaking this out by business, sales in Fluid Systems were $607 million, up 6% operationally ||| earnings Positive Confident

The expansion and growing adoption of our Ryzen CPUs, combined with our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year Graphics revenue growth, resulted in a 51% increase in Computing and Graphics segment sales year-over-year ||| sales Neutral

So Ill focus my comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses ||| Neutral

We had a quarter any CEO would be proud of ||| Neutral

as well has a good opening backlog ||| Neutral

Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points ||| Neutral

For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 27% ||| earnings Neutral

In terms of the product refresh, I think I caught the question, but if I didnt, Andy, excuse me, will correct me ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Thank you, Meta ||| Neutral

And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that have to repaired and ultimately brought on line, those homes will get repaired ||| Neutral

We started to design ships with more spacious public areas, better outfitting and more amenities onboard ||| products_services Positive

That, in turn, causes slightly higher operating costs per lower berth, but obviously the bottom line impact is very positive ||| earnings Neutral

I do think that what you're going to see in 2017, and I said for the foreseeable future, because I think you're going to hear in 2017, you're going to hear about new product adjacencies that we are going to enter ||| products_services Neutral Uncertain

Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations was approximately $801 million ||| earnings Neutral Confident

So, I ask you to keep that in mind when you think about how realistic the 15% to 20% is ||| earnings Positive Confident

Wed like to work to photo booths into that and then we go and we choose certain other markets to go back and put the booths in ||| Neutral

Through the investments we've already made and plan to make through the balance of the year to drive accelerated growth in CEB's contract value, we continue to expect modest net synergy flow-through in 2017. We continue to work the cost synergy side of the equation and we'll report back on our progress in subsequent quarters ||| sales,op_costs,organic_expansion Positive Confident

and $459 million was held by our international entities ||| earnings Positive Confident

Of course, we have incumbent products too ||| products_services Positive Confident

So, it's about $200 million increase ||| Neutral

International represented 35% of total revenue, and reflected higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we saw a turn there and overall improvement off a weak Q1 2016. The remaining 5% of our revenues are in other, which includes our OEM business, sales of Fuji Xerox and licensing ||| sales Negative

So just as just as with profits, we think most of the cost increase for the full year has happened in the quarter closer to the full year ||| earnings Neutral

These are algorithms ||| Neutral

Excluding the impact of the Accenture Post Trade Processing or APTP recontracted from a year ago, which I will discuss in my comments on the GTO segment results, internal growth would have been neutral, and organic recurring fee revenue growth was at 5% ||| sales,organic_expansion Positive Confident

But we have had times where we've had even bigger differential between worksite employee growth and our pass-through revenue growth ||| sales Positive Confident

These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items ||| acquisitions Neutral

Just a couple of comments ||| Neutral

Yes ||| Neutral

I think the easiest answer is no ||| Neutral Uncertain

On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 92%, primarily due to a stronger DRAM pricing environment, increased bit volumes in both DRAM and NAND and our focus on higher value-add solutions to improve our product mix ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

On the positive side, as discussed in our last quarterly call, we benefited from four extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's, which we estimate contributed roughly half our growth for the quarter ||| earnings Positive Confident

The other thing Id add to that Toni is this strategy to pivot to the value in the growth segments of our portfolio is absolutely critical because, just a mix shift of a couple of percent actually increases the operating margin ||| sales,earnings Positive Confident

I think you'll hear more about that tomorrow ||| Neutral

So even a problem like the power in Puerto Rico brings some of the manpower from the power companies locally to other areas and impairs their ability to get back up running here in south Florida ||| Neutral

Return on invested capital for 2016 was 13.09% ||| earnings Neutral Confident

Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.87, which reflects the one-for-four reverse stock split was down $0.11 from the second quarter of 2016, driven by the higher tax rate and lower equity income as cost and expense declines including lower interest expense roughly offset the impact of lower revenues ||| sales,op_costs Negative

We've sharpened our focus on reducing leakage and on providing our customers with the tools they need to realize the greatest business benefit of buying within their Prime Vendor Agreement ||| earnings Positive Confident

So that's why we're so focused on it ||| Neutral

So, were seeing that whether it's in financial services, whether we are seeing retail, travel hospitality, automotive, its a key part of our differentiator and one that we will continue to innovate in ||| products_services Positive Confident

Ryan, on the containers? ||| Neutral

We achieved strong Q1 TubeMogul revenue, and we are hard at work integrating TubeMogul with our current Adobe Media Optimizer solution ||| sales Positive Confident

It was a big launch for us ||| Neutral

Well, in general, I think we're in a phase of the industry around us and ourselves that tends to be strong and when we give you directions on growth rates of the different areas, we always look at it from a perspective of a multi-year outlook because that's sort of the only fair way to do it, all the more given that we have a multi-year agreement ||| sales Neutral Uncertain

Declines are driven by the more mature large enterprise segment of the market as our SMB-focused channels, Xerox Partner Print Services and GIS, which comprise almost 25% of our MDS revenues, were growing mid-single digits ||| sales,products_services Negative

So it continues to get healthier ||| Neutral

We drive that base off of really what products we want to drive and put in front of the customer ||| Neutral

Yes, sure ||| Neutral

Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment ||| Neutral

Those are the two biggest chunks ||| Neutral

Good afternoon, everyone ||| Neutral

Memory shipments were very strong in the quarter, as customers continued their investments in three 3D NAND capacity ||| organic_expansion Positive Confident

We expect ongoing growth based on continued adoption of our recent mask technology and positive customer feedback across the spectrum: patients, physicians and homecare providers ||| products_services Neutral Confident

The total revenue decline of 6.4% in constant currency in Q2 was below trend as discussed, driven predominantly by equipment sales ||| sales Negative

So all of this is being done ||| Neutral

The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer engagement ||| products_services Positive

We have made announcements with several of them ||| Neutral

Well, let me start and Im sure that Jon whos really been spearheading the dynamic pricing and Rick would also want to join in ||| Neutral

I would say are the two dominant drivers of our overall measurement of success, and they will continue to measure against the anticipated benefits that we have around ||| Neutral

So I think all three things are a factor ||| Neutral

Were back in our game on  in soup this year ||| products_services Positive Confident

I should note however that our rate of growth in Q4 was held back by two factors ||| sales Negative Confident

62% of patients initiating therapy in the first quarter had fibrosis scores of F0 to F2. That's the highest we've seen for this metric, and indicative of the fact that patients are coming into care with earlier-stage disease, a trend that is illustrated on slide 26. Over the last six months, we've introduced two new direct-to-consumer campaigns ||| products_services Positive Confident

So, the thing thats really important is the all of that together, the price, the specific price items, really each one of us would have different items that are in our biggest hot button ||| products_services Neutral Dodgy

So, I think you'll find that the retailers actually welcome the DSD suppliers to keep their shelves looking good going forward and that's what we provide with our beverage portfolio ||| products_services Positive Confident

Our Surface business performed better than we expected, declining 2% and 1% in constant currency, with strong sales execution on our Surface Pro product transition and early positive signals from customers and partners on our Surface Laptop launch in June ||| sales,products_services Positive Confident

Our effective tax rate was 23.6% and EPS was $3.60. These results include the fourth quarter items I mentioned previously and the impact from the first quarter of $38 million accounts receivable reserve related to the proton therapy business ||| earnings Positive Confident

and Germany they did have very good years in particular in Q4. Now if you separate the fact that we had the larger base with clearly contribute to that bookings number being big, aside from that in particular Azure in the last year point did really show up in that 18.9, it didn't, the strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide and it was significant, a lot of that is the Azure fillings ||| sales Positive Confident

We now expect GAAP revenue growth to be a low-single-digit increase, a slight improvement from the previous outlook of flat to low-single-digit increase ||| sales Positive Confident

Basically for the year, we spoke to 15 to 20 basis points impact on operating margin advantage for Canada ||| earnings Positive

And so I think while I do understand that people will ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth ||| sales,earnings,competition Neutral Uncertain
